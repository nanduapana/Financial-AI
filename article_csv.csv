6,GST Council to discuss application of Section 11A amendment to resolve retrospective tax disputes,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/gst-council-to-discuss-application-of-section-11a-amendment-to-resolve-retrospective-tax-disputes-12815756.html,general,2024-09-06 09:47:00+05:30,"The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council is set to meet in Delhi on September 9 to discuss the implementation of the newly introduced Section 11A in the Central Goods and Services Tax Act (CGST) of 2017. The meeting will focus on interpreting the amendment of the section in a bid to grant relief to demand for retrospective tax. It will have implications for the real-money gaming (RMG) â€” online games where players can wager and win real money â€” industry and other sectors, an official said. In its 53rd meeting held in June, the council had recommended the insertion of Section 11A toÂ  regularise non-levy or short-levy of GST. Section 11A seeks to provide a legal safeguard against punitive retrospective tax demand and potentially alleviate financial burdens on industries facing outstanding GST dues. An official told Moneycontrol, â€ś11A amendment has been passed. Corresponding circular is awaited and a discussion to this effect will be held in the next Council meeting on September 9. The circular will centre on how to apply and interpret the law pending approval from the council.â€ť Once implemented, it will reduce legal disputes as well. â€śThe GST Council is expected to exercise powers of Section 11A to reduce litigation woes,â€ť said Ankit Jain, Partner at Ved Jain & Associates.Â â€śWeâ€™re hopeful that the matter comes up for discussion and a clarification is issued,â€ť he added. Implications for RMG and other sectors The councilâ€™s decision may have major implications for the RMG sector, which has been grappling with significant GST retrospective tax demand pertaining to a period between July 1 , 2017 â€” the day GST was rolled out â€” and March 31, 2023. Last December, the finance ministry had said that 71 show cause notices were issued to online gaming companies for their alleged GST evasion worth over Rs 1.12 lakh crore. Businesses providing corporate guarantees are also hoping for clarity on past tax liabilities. â€śSection 11A represents a significant legal development in the GST framework. It offers a crucial safeguard against the punitive application of retrospective tax demand,â€ť SR Patnaik, Partner, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, told Moneycontrol. He emphasised that this provision could resolve disputes involving corporate guarantees, employee secondments, and reimbursements to information technology (IT) and airline companies. The council's decision could mark a significant step toward reducing litigation and promoting ease of doing business by regularising past trade practices and settling long-pending tax disputes across various sectors.

With a Rs 1,100 target, HSBC has forecast an upside potential of just 3 percent from the last closing price on the National Stock Exchange.

10,Twelve IPOs will compete to raise over $1 billion next week,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/twelve-ipos-will-compete-to-raise-over-1-billion-in-a-single-week-12815780.html,general,2024-09-06 10:01:00+05:30,"Twelve initial public offers (IPOs), which include four from the main board and eight from small and medium enterprises (SMEs), are looking to raise over $1 billion or Rs 8,600 crore in the coming week. Among the main board IPOs, the four firms that will compete for investor attention are Bajaj Housing Finance, which will raise around Rs 6,560 crore, Tolins Tyres (Rs 230 crore), Kross Ltd (Rs 500 crore) and P N Gadgil Jewellers (Rs 1,100 crore). Another main board IPO, Western Carriers India, is likely to open soon though the company is yet to announce the details in terms of the issue opening and closing dates. While Bajaj Housing Finance, Tolins Tyres and Kross Ltd will open for subscription on September 9 and close on September 11, P N Gadgil Jeweller IPO will open on September 10 and close on September 12.  Apurva Sheth, Head of Market Perspectives and Research at SAMCO Securities, highlights several factors driving the positive trend in India's primary market. The current market buoyancy is fueled by broad investor participation with retail investors eager to capitalise on attractive listing gains, spurred by the strong performance of the secondary market -- Nifty is up 15.71 percent in the current calendar year till date. Additionally, robust liquidity among both domestic and foreign institutional investors has significantly bolstered the IPO market pipeline. Incidentally, the grey market premiums (GMP) for these firms are also surging. Bajaj Housing Finance GMP is trading at Rs 51 a share, up 73 percent from its upper end price band of Rs 70 a share, Tolins Tyres GMP is trading 12 percent higher while P N Gadgil Jewellers IPO is trading over 37 percent higher. Among SME IPOs, four companies -- Gajanand International, Share Samadhan, Shubhshree Biofuels Energy and Aditya Ultra Steel -- will open for subscription on September 9 and close on September 11. Two firms -- Trafiksol ITS Technologies, SPP Polymer -- will open on September 10 and close on September 13 while another two -- Innomet Advanced Materials and Excellent Wires & Packaging -- will open on September 11 and close on September 13. These firms will raise between Rs 12-45 crore each through their public issues. The recent past has seen IPOs attracting huge subscriptions. Among main board IPOs in August, the average subscription was over 75 times, while the average for 2024 so far stands at 66 times. For SME IPOs, the average subscription in August reached 290 times, with a year-to-date average of over 259 times. The strong subscription across IPOs has been driven by robust participation from retail, institutional, and foreign investors. Data from NSDL shows that while foreign investors have been net sellers in secondary markets, they have consistently invested in primary markets. In August, FIIs invested around Rs 12,872 crore, and so far in CY24, their investments in primary markets have totalled around Rs54,883 crore. Analysts note that most recent IPO offerings are emerging from high-growth, sunrise sectors, thereby attracting investors anticipating strong growth potential. This trend is expected to continue through the rest of 2024 and may extend into 2025, they say. â€śWith growing retail participation and renewed interest from FIIs, driven largely by evolving global macroeconomic conditions, the market environment seems favorable for several upcoming IPOs to finally make their debut on the bourses. The recent success of multiple listings is likely to generate even greater interest in the next wave of IPOs,â€ť says Nirav Karkera, Head of Research at Fisdom.

""On the back of strong demand, the deal size has been increased, and now Peak XV Partners has sold 22 per cent instead of the earlier proposed 11 percent dilution,"" said one of the persons above. As per exchange data, Peak XV Partners Investments currently holds 25.23 per cent stake in Indigo Paints. Post the upsized block deal, Peak XV Partners will hold onto the balance stake of around 3.23 percent, sources added. Moneycontrol was the first to report the block trade launch on September 5. The report said that the floor price of the block deal is Rs 1,470 per share, a discount of 4.6 percent to the closing price of Indigo Paints on September 5. It added that investment bank Jefferies is acting as the advisor on the deal. Peak XV Partners Investments declined to comment and Jefferies couldn't be reached for an immediate response. In the past 12-18 months, Peak XV has also been monetising stake in other firms like Go Fashion, Five Star Business Finance and Aptus Value Housing. ""Given the relatively small scale of Indigo Paints in the large paints industry, the company has been able to grow much faster than the industry. Rising brand acceptance by consumers and the expansion of its distribution network have been driving the outperformance. However, the changing competitive landscape will be a key monitorable,"" said brokerage Motilal Oswal in a report on the firm released in August.

Speaking at an event to mark the centenary year of Shankar Dinkar Kane (popularly known as Bhaiyyaji). Kane worked in Manipur and focused on childrenâ€™s education until 1971 and brought these students to Maharashtra. â€śWe should strive to do as much good work in our life as possible. No one is saying that we should not shine or stand out. Through the work, everyone can become a revered figure. But whether we have reached that level will be determined by others, not by ourselves. We should not proclaim that we have become God,â€ť said Bhagwat while recounting the work of Kane. Speaking about the current situation in Manipur, Bhagwat said the prevailing circumstances are â€śdifficultâ€ť. Two persons including a woman were killed and several others were injured on Sunday when armed Kuki groups attacked the Koutruk area using drones. On Monday, three civilians were injured in a similar bomb attack using drones at Senjam Chirang Maning Leikai in Imphal West district. Security forces are in the area to repulse the attack. â€śThere is no guarantee of safety. The locals are doubtful about their security. For those who have gone there for business or social work, the situation is even more challenging. But even in such conditions, the volunteers of the RSS are firmly stationed, serving both factions and trying to pacify the situation,â€ť said Bhagwat. Bhagwat clarified that the Sangh volunteers had not left Manipur. According to him, the RSS cadre is actively working to restore normalcy and reduce tensions between the two groups. According to him, the â€śPurvanchalâ€ť region was known as the ""region of problems"" about 15 years ago and some extremist groups even spoke the language of detaching (seceding), but it did not happen and the region saw a turnaround, he said. ""A sense of 'swadharm' (own duty) prevailed among the people. The feeling that we belong to India is growing stronger. The disturbances we see in states like Manipur today are the handiwork of some who want to create obstacles on the path to progress. But their plans will not succeed,"" he said.

14,Ajit Pawar on Mahayuti seat-sharing: 'NCP to contest over 60 seats in Maharashtra elections',https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/ajit-pawar-ncp-contest-60-seats-maharashtra-elections-2024-mahayuti-seat-sharing-12815805.html,general,2024-09-06 09:42:00+05:30,"Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Ajit Pawar on Thursday said that his party will contest more than 60 seats as part of the Mahayuti alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Shiv Sena (Balasaheb) in the elections to the 288-member Maharashtra Assembly slated to be held this year. Seen as a litmus test for Pawar and his faction, especially after the below-par performance in the Lok Sabha elections, the NCP chief said that seat-sharing among alliance partners should be based on merit and pointed out that the party won 56 seats in the previous elections and would stake its claim to contest a higher number of seats this time around. ŌĆ£We won 56 seats in the 2019 Assembly polls and have around six-seven Independent MLAs with us. So, we wish to contest these 60 seats. But we will definitely seek more, and it will be decided on electoral merit,ŌĆØ Ajit Pawar said in an interview to The Indian Express. PawarŌĆÖs claims comes amid reports of the NCP being deliberately sidelined by the BJP after the former failed to make a mark in the Lok Sabha elections held earlier this year. The RSS, the ideological mentor of the BJP, has held the NCP responsible for the saffron partyŌĆÖs poor performance in the polls. The Mahayuti alliance is yet to officially begin seat-sharing talks for polls expected to be held in November this year. In the Lok Sabha elections this year, the Ajit Pawar faction of the NCP managed to win just 1 seat while the faction led by his uncle Sharad Pawar bagged 8. The Congress emerged as the party with the maximum seats (13), followed by the BJP (9), Shiv Sena (UBT) at 9 and the Shinde Sena at 7. Asked about the NCPŌĆÖs lackadaisical performance, Ajit Pawar sought to deflect the blame on the BJPŌĆÖs ŌĆśAbki Baar 400 PaarŌĆÖ slogan, claiming that it allowed the Opposition to run home with its narrative that a brute majority to the NDA would allow it to alter the Constitution and end reservations. ŌĆ£Ab ki baar, 400 paar slogan did not go down well as the people thought that after winning 400 seats, the NDA government would change the Constitution, bring in Uniform Civil Code, implement the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act), abolish reservationŌĆ” Also, because of the ŌĆś400 paarŌĆÖ campaign, our party workers got relaxed, thinking it (the election) was a cakewalk,ŌĆØ Pawar told IE. Pawar also brushed aside the criticism that the he compromised on the NCPŌĆÖs secular ideology by allying with the Shiv Sena and the BJP, parties seen as pro-Hindu. ŌĆ£When we started the discussion on the alliance, we clearly stated that our ideology was ŌĆśsecularŌĆÖ and we would not compromise on it, at all,ŌĆØ Pawar claimed. He also pointed out that such questions were never raised when the undivided NCP was in alliance with the Shiv Sena. ŌĆ£The hardcore Hindutvawadi party was the Shiv SenaŌĆ” But you (the Congress and united NCP) were in government with the Shiv Sena for two-and-a-half years (the 2019-June 2022 Maha Vikas Aghadi government)ŌĆ” I was also a part of it. So why were such questions not asked then? Where was this secular ideology and progressive thought?ŌĆØ Pawar slammed those questioning the NCP for joining the Mahayuti government with the sole agenda of development and a clear stand that it will not compromise on its secular ideology. Asked who will be the chief ministerial face for the elections and whether the Mahayuti would announce a CM face ahead of elections, Pawar said that the primary objective of the alliance is to secure a majority and form a government. ŌĆ£Then we can think about the CM face. But the CM will surely be of the Mahayuti.ŌĆØ

Like Xiaomi, India was a major growth driver for Vivo as wel. For vivo also, India was the major growth driver along with China and emerging Asian economies. â€ś5G handset contribution to the overall handset market was over 54% in H1 2024, crossing 50% for the first time. As the democratisation of 5G handsets increases with increasing 5G penetration in lower price segments as well as increasing expansion of 5G networks, this trend will further grow,â€ť said Tarun Pathak, research director, Counterpoint Research.

On a monthly basis, however, it increased just by 9 percent.Â The spending stood at Rs 1.59 lakh crore in June 2024Â and atÂ Rs 1.45 lakh crore in July 2023. Experts attributed this growth toÂ deeper penetration of credit cards and payments through credit cards on the Unified Payment Interface (UPI). â€śThe spends have been increasing (year-on-year) across categories. This can be attributed to increasing penetration of credit cards which, along with the option of making payment through credit cards on UPI, has led to increased spends on credit cards,â€ť said Sachin Sachdeva, vice-presidentÂ and sector head of Financial Sector RatingsÂ at ICRA. Out of the total Rs 1.73 lakh crore credit card transactions, e-commerce payments have been highest of Rs 1.11 lakh crore. This was followed by a point of sale (PoS) expenditure of Rs 62,285 crore. E-commerce payment transactions rose 16 percent on a yearly basis, PoS transactions surged 25 percent on-year, data showed. â€śThe increasing penetration of PoS machines and widening merchant base accepting the credit cards is also driving up spends,â€ť said Sachdeva.   HDFC Bank credit card topped the league of card players with transactions worth Rs 44,369 crore in July, which was 12.6 percent higher than a year-ago period. ICICI BankÂ came next with Rs 34,566 crore, up 33.7 percent on-year, and State Bank of India credit cardÂ spends jumped 4 percent to Rs 26,878 crore. The total number of credit cards issued by banks in India has increased to 10.46 crore in July 2024, as compared to 8.99 crore in a year-ago period. It was 10.38 crore at the end of June 2024. HDFC Bank leads the position in issuance of credit cards with cards in circulation standing at 2.17 crore, and State Bank of Indiaâ€™s cards in circulation stood at 1.94 crore in July. Going ahead, ICRA's Sachdeva expects the credit card penetration and usage of digital payments to continue rising. â€śGiven the reach and popularity of UPI, the addition of more credit card networks on UPI platform would further increase the card spends,â€ť he added.

32,Trump says he'd create a government efficiency commission led by Elon Musk,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/trump-says-hed-create-a-government-efficiency-commission-led-by-elon-musk-12815708.html,World,2024-09-06 07:59:00+05:30,"Former President Donald Trump said Thursday he would create a government efficiency commission to audit the entire federal government, an idea suggested by billionaire Elon Musk, who would lead it. The commission is the latest attention-grabbing alliance between Trump and Musk, who leads companies including Tesla and SpaceX and has become an increasingly vocal supporter of Trump's bid to return to the White House. The Republican presidential nominee claimed that in 2022, â€śfraud and improper payments alone cost taxpayers an estimated hundreds of billions of dollars.â€ť He said the commission would recommend â€śdrastic reforms"" and develop a plan to eliminate fraud and improper payments within six months, which he said would save trillions of dollars. â€śWe need to do it,"" Trump said. â€śCan't go on the way we are now.â€ť Trump also promised to cut 10 government regulations for every new regulation implemented if he's elected in November. He announced the plans in a speech to the Economic Club of New York, a group of executives and industry leaders, where he also unveiled proposals to slash regulations and boost energy production, embrace cryptocurrencies and drastically cut government spending as well as corporate taxes for companies that produce in the U.S. â€śI look forward to serving America if the opportunity arises,â€ť Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he owns. â€śNo pay, no title, no recognition is needed.â€ť The former president and Musk discussed a role for the entrepreneur in a second Trump administration during a streamed conversation on X last month. â€śYouâ€™re the greatest cutter,â€ť Trump told Musk then. â€śI need an Elon Musk â€” I need somebody that has a lot of strength and courage and smarts. I want to close up the Department of Education, move education back to the states.â€ť Trump and Musk, two of the worldâ€™s most powerful men, have shifted from being bitter rivals to unlikely allies over the span of one election season. Musk, who described himself as a â€śmoderate Democratâ€ť until recently, suggested in 2022 that Trump was too old to be president again. Still, Musk formally endorsed Trump two days after his assassination attempt last month. Presidents have made various efforts to reform government over the years, including the National Partnership for Reinventing Government created during Bill Clinton's presidency, which was headed by then-Vice President Al Gore. It aimed to simplify the federal bureaucracy, cut costs and make agencies more responsive to the public.

33,"Summer of 2024 was world's hottest on record, says EU climate change monitor",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/environment/summer-of-2024-was-worlds-hottest-on-record-says-eu-climate-change-monitor-12815702.html,World,2024-09-06 07:51:00+05:30,"The world is emerging from its warmest northern hemisphere summer since records began, the European Union's climate change monitoring service said on Friday, as global warming continues to intensify. The boreal summer of June to August this year blew past last summer to become the world's warmest, the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said in a monthly bulletin. The exceptional heat increases the likelihood that 2024 will outrank 2023 as the planet's warmest on record. ""During the past three months of 2024, the globe has experienced the hottest June and August, the hottest day on record, and the hottest boreal summer on record,"" said C3S deputy director Samantha Burgess. Unless countries urgently reduce their planet-heating emissions, extreme weather ""will only become more intense"", she said. Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels are the main cause of climate change. The planet's changed climate continued to fuel disasters this summer. In Sudan, flooding from heavy rains last month affected more than 300,000 people and brought cholera to the war-torn country. Elsewhere, scientists confirmed climate change is driving a severe ongoing drought on the Italian islands of Sicily and Sardinia, and it intensified Typhoon Gaemi, which tore through the Philippines, Taiwan and China in July, leaving more than 100 people dead. Human-caused climate change and the El Nino natural weather phenomenon, which warms the surface waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean, both pushed temperatures to record highs earlier in the year. Copernicus said below-average temperatures in the equatorial Pacific last month indicated a shift to La Nina, which is El Nino's cooler counterpart. But that didn't prevent unusually high global sea surface temperatures worldwide, with average temperatures in August hotter than in the same month of any other year except for 2023. C3S' dataset goes back to 1940, which the scientists cross-checked with other data to confirm that this summer was the hottest since the 1850 pre-industrial period.

34,What new proposals did Trump make during his economic speech?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/what-new-proposals-did-trump-make-during-his-economic-speech-12815693.html,World,2024-09-06 07:24:00+05:30,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump laid out his economic vision for the country on Thursday during a speech at the New York Economic Club. Here are the new proposals Trump outlined: SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUND Trump said if he is elected he would create a sovereign wealth fund to invest in ""great national endeavors,"" including major infrastructure projects such as highways and airports.He said the fund would be created ""through tariffs and other intelligent things"" but gave no details. TAX CUTS FOR DOMESTIC PRODUCERS Trump pledged to reduce the corporate tax rate from 21% to 15% for companies that make their products in the US. While he had already said he wanted to cut the corporate tax rate to 15%, he had not previously tied that lower rate to keeping manufacturing inside the country. Trump slashed the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% during his 2017-2021 presidency and in June he vowed to cut it further. He repeated his proposal to eliminate taxes on income from tips, an idea he first floated in June to appeal to service workers. Current law requires employees to report their tips as income. ELON MUSK AS EFFICIENCY CZAR Trump said he would set up an independent government efficiency panel headed by billionaire supporter Elon Musk to root out waste in the federal government. He did not detail how the body would function but said it would develop a plan to root out ""fraud and improper payments"" within six months of being formed. The idea is not novel. Other politicians have proposed similar investigative bodies, and Republican President Ronald Reagan set up the Grace Commission to do the same thing during his 1981-89 presidency. Many agencies are already dedicated to investigating fraud and inefficiency within the federal government, including the Government Accountability Office and dozens of separate inspectors general. ENERGY EMERGENCY Trump pledged to issue a national emergency declaration to boost domestic energy supply. He said he would use it to eliminate bureaucratic hurdles holding up new energy projects. Presidents can use emergency declarations to invoke a suite of special powers, though attempts to help energy companies skirt regulators would likely be challenged in the courts and in Congress. BANNING MORTGAGES FOR MIGRANTS LIVING IN THE U.S. ILLEGALLY Trump said he would ban mortgages for migrants living illegally in California, after claiming without evidence that they were driving up housing costs. He did not provide specifics on how he would enact such a ban and did not say whether the ban would apply beyond California. Banks can legally provide mortgages to undocumented migrants, but do so infrequently. HOUSING AFFORDABILITY Trump pledged to open up portions of federal land for large-scale housing construction, with zones that will be ""ultra low-tax and ultra low-regulation."" While he had previously said he would open federal lands to new housing construction, this appeared to be the first time he pledged to create a special tax and regulatory regime to draw homebuilders to those areas. Trump has previously spoken against proposals to loosen local zoning restrictions that prevent apartments, duplexes and other forms of affordable housing from being built in neighborhoods reserved for single family houses. The Republican Party's platform calls for boosting home ownership through tax breaks and eliminating regulations, though it does not outline specifics.

The AI Convention, which has been in the works for years and was adopted in May after discussions between 57 countries, addresses the risks AI may pose, while promoting responsible innovation. ""This Convention is a major step to ensuring that these new technologies can be harnessed without eroding our oldest values, like human rights and the rule of law,"" Britain's justice minister, Shabana Mahmood, said in a statement. The AI Convention mainly focuses on the protection of human rights of people affected by AI systems and is separate from the EU AI Act, which entered into force last month. The EU's AI Act entails comprehensive regulations on the development, deployment, and use of AI systems within the EU internal market. The Council of Europe, founded in 1949, is an international organization distinct from the EU with a mandate to safeguard human rights; 46 countries are members, including all the 27 EU member states. An ad hoc committee in 2019 started examining the feasibility of an AI framework convention and a Committee on Artificial Intelligence was formed in 2022 which drafted and negotiated the text. The signatories can choose to adopt or maintain legislative, administrative or other measures to give effect to the provisions. Francesca Fanucci, a legal expert at ECNL (European Center for Not-for-Profit Law Stichting) who contributed to the treaty's drafting process alongside other civil society groups, told Reuters the agreement had been ""watered down"" into a broad set of principles. ""The formulation of principles and obligations in this convention is so overbroad and fraught with caveats that it raises serious questions about their legal certainty and effective enforceability,"" she said. Fanucci highlighted exemptions on AI systems used for national security purposes, and limited scrutiny of private companies versus the public sector, as flaws. ""This double standard is disappointing,"" she added. The UK government said it would work with regulators, the devolved administrations, and local authorities to ensure it can appropriately implement its new requirements. With input from Reuters ",NA

Packing maximum sustained winds of 245 km per hour (152 mph) near its eye, Yagi registers as the world's second-most powerful tropical cyclone in 2024 so far, after the Category 5 Atlantic hurricane Beryl. More than doubling in strength since devastating northern Philippines earlier this week, Yagi is expected to make landfall along China's coast from Wenchang in Hainan to Leizhou, Guangdong from Friday afternoon. Winds and rain were accompanied by powerful thunder and lightening across the region overnight and on Friday morning. Transport links across southern China were mostly shuttered on Friday with many flights cancelled in Hainan, Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau. The world's longest sea crossing, the main bridge linking Hong Kong with Macau and Zhuhai in Guangdong, was also closed. In the financial hub of Hong Kong, the stock exchange was shuttered while schools remained closed. The typhoon 8 signal, the third highest, would be in place until at least 12pm on Friday, Hong Kong's observatory said, meaning many businesses would remain shut and transport will be significantly reduced. ""Intense rainbands associated with Yagi will bring heavy squally showers to the territory,"" it said, warning residents to stay away from the shoreline. China's government sent task forces to Guangdong and Hainan to guide flood and typhoon prevention, official news agency Xinhua said. Super Typhoon Yagi's projected landfall in Hainan is rare, as most typhoons landing on the duty-free island are classified as weak. From 1949 to 2023, 106 typhoons landed in Hainan but only nine were classified as super typhoons. Typhoons are becoming stronger, fuelled by warmer oceans, amid climate change, scientists say. Last week, Typhoon Shanshan slammed into southwestern Japan, the strongest storm to hit the country in decades. Yagi, which strengthened into a super typhoon on Wednesday night, is the Japanese word for goat and for the constellation of Capricornus, a mythical creature that is half goat, half fish.

Brent crude futures rose 19 cents, or 0.26%, to $72.88 at 0010 GMT, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were up 22 cents, or 0.32%, to $69.37. ""Crude oil edged higher as bullish signals offset the bearish sentiment that has gripped the market in recent days,"" ANZ analyst Daniel Hynes said, adding that a weaker dollar was also supporting commodities prices. Brent settled down 1 cent at its lowest close since June 2023 on Thursday and WTI was down 5 cents to the lowest close since December 2023 after data showed that U.S. crude stockpiles fell to a one-year low last week. Crude stockpiles fell by 6.9 million barrels to 418.3 million barrels last week compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 993,000-barrel draw. Also lifting prices, OPEC+ agreed to delay a planned oil production increase for October and November, the producers group said on Thursday, adding that it could further pause or reverse the hikes if needed. The latest US economic data offered some relief about the health of the economy to a market looking for clues about the path of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. US services sector activity was steady in August, but employment gains slowed, remaining consistent with an easing labor market. The mixed signals from job market indicators weighed on the dollar, which sagged near a one-week low ahead of crucial monthly payrolls data due later on Friday. A weaker dollar makes oil cheaper for buyers using other currencies.

Treasury yields opened steady in the Asian session after minor declines Thursday, adding downward pressure on the greenback. The Bloomberg dollar index, which tracks the US currency against a basket of peers, inched lower early Friday after a 0.2% drop on Thursday. Australian and New Zealand bonds were little changed. The muted moves come ahead of a nonfarm payroll report that will cast fresh light on the health of the US jobs market. Traders are still pricing in over 100 basis points of easing this year, implying a potential super-sized reduction.

In the run-up to the US payroll figures, economic data was mixed.

The jobs report is expected to show payrolls increased by about 165,000, based on estimates.

Within two minutes he heard the boom of a strike that made the girl, 10-year-old Tala Abu Ajwa, the latest child fatality in the ongoing war in Gaza that has killed tens of thousands. ""She begged me and said, 'Please, Daddy, let me go out'. I felt sad because she wanted to play with the girls"" in the neighbourhood, Hussam told AFP after the strike on Tuesday. Upon hearing the blast he raced outside, but ""when I reached the flat that had been bombed, I found her among the rubble"", he said. ""I recognised her by her roller skates, the only thing that was visible."" Details of the strike were unclear. A photograph of Tala has since circulated widely on social media, the skates with white velcro straps and pink wheels sticking out from underneath a white cloth covering her dead body. Mass wartime displacement and destruction of schools have deprived children across the Gaza Strip of chances for recreation. More than 70 percent of schools operated by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, have been destroyed or damaged, agency chief Philippe Lazzarini said on X this week. ""The longer children stay out of school, the higher the risk of a lost generation, fuelling resentment & extremism,"" Lazzarini said. ""With no ceasefire, children are likely to fall prey to exploitation including child labour and recruitment into armed groups."" 'We don't want wars, Mum' For Tala, the problem was more basic: she simply did not like being cooped up indoors all the time, Hussam said. ""She was cheerful and always liked to laugh, and loved to get out of the house,"" he said. ""She had lots of dreams. She was always asking me for lots of things and I responded to her requests. She told me. 'I want a pair of skates', so I brought them for her."" The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas's attack on southern Israel on October 7 which resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians and including hostages killed in captivity, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. Of 251 hostages seized by Palestinian militants during the attack, 97 remain in Gaza including 33 the Israeli military says are dead. Israel's retaliatory campaign against Hamas has killed at least 40,878 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children. Now that Tala is gone, her parents and brothers are left to marvel at their bad luck, with the strike landing during one of the rare occasions Hussam let one of his children go outside. ""She used to say to me, 'Why don't we live like all the other children in the world? I wish we could live a peaceful life. We don't want wars, Mum. I've had enough of wars',"" her mother, Umm Tala, recalled. ""She was one of the best pupils and she excelled, she was very intelligent. She used to say to me: 'I'd like to be able to go to the park and play.' She's dead and so are her wishes.""

40,South Korea says North Korea has again launched trash-carrying balloons across border,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/south-korea-says-north-korea-has-again-launched-trash-carrying-balloons-across-border-12815606.html,World,2024-09-05 22:32:00+05:30,"North Korea is flying more trash-carrying balloons toward South Korea, officials said Thursday, in the latest round of Cold War-style psychological warfare between the rivals. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected balloons launched from North Korea on Thursday morning following launches the previous evening. It said the North again floated balloons on Thursday evening. Since May, North Korea has flown thousands of balloons toward South Korea to drop substances such as wastepaper, cloth scraps, cigarette butts and even manure, in what it described as retaliation against South Korean civilian activists who fly anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets across the border. North Korea is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of its authoritarian leadership and its third-generation ruler, Kim Jong Un. The joint chiefs said North Korea launched around 420 balloons from Wednesday evening to early Thursday and about 20 of them had been discovered so far in Seoul, the South Korean capital, and nearby Gyeonggi province. It said the balloons that landed were filled with paper waste, plastic bottles and other trash but contained no hazardous materials. The joint chiefs said North Korea flew another set of balloons on two separate launch events on Thursday. It advised people to report to the police or military if they see any fallen balloons and not to touch them. No major damage was immediately reported. An Associated Press photojournalist spotted several sets of white balloons, which were tied in pairs, floating in the air above the inter-Korean border area from an observatory in the South Korean border city of Paju on Thursday morning. Seoul's city government issued text alerts Wednesday evening as the North Korean balloons began appearing over South Korean territory, advising people to stay indoors and beware of objects dropping from the sky. Trash carried by at least one North Korean balloon fell on the South Korean presidential compound in July, raising concerns about the vulnerability of key South Korean facilities. Officials said the balloon contained no dangerous material and no one was hurt. South Korea, in response to the North Korean balloons, has reactivated its front-line loudspeakers to blast propaganda messages and K-pop songs toward the North. The tit-for-tat Cold War-style campaigns are adding to tensions fuelled by North Korea's growing nuclear ambitions and South Korea's expansion of joint military exercises with the United States.

We are ready to fight an election whenever it happens,"" he told reporters in Toronto. Trudeau's government can be defeated if all the opposition parties unite and back a no-confidence vote. Singh side-stepped questions as to whether he would vote to bring the government down, saying his left-leaning party would decide on an issue-by-issue basis on whether to support the Liberals. The NDP is the fourth-largest party in the House of Commons. Trudeau's government, however, would survive if the NDP abstained during any confidence vote.

The following are the likely next steps for Barnier as he settles into his new office. FORMING A GOVERNMENT The political veteran's first order of business will be to come up with a new government, which has to be signed off on by Macron. Given Macron's lack of a parliamentary majority, Barnier will need to carefully weigh who gets what ministerial portfolio as opposition parties will be unforgiving towards any casting errors. VOTE OF CONFIDENCE By tradition, soon after forming a government the new prime minister delivers a speech to the National Assembly outlining policy priorities, such as possible reforms. If the new premier does not then seek a vote of confidence in the lower house of parliament, then opposition parties can seek one instead. A vote of no-confidence against Barnier's government would require 289 votes in favour in the 577-seat lower house. With leftist parties set to vote against, Barnier's political survival is likely to hinge on the far right National Rally abstaining from a vote against him. They have said they would wait and see first what he has to say about immigration and changing France's voting system. BUDGET If Barnier makes it past that hurdle, the first major policy challenge he faces is drafting 2025 budget legislation, which must be handed over to lawmakers by Oct. 1. That leaves precious little time for Barnier's team to finish off work already prepared by the outgoing government by mid-September, when the national public finance watchdog is by law due a chance to weigh on whether the numbers stack up. That will be no easy task with the budget deficit already this year running billions of euros over target, leaving Barnier tough choices about calibrating spending cuts and tax rises. Once the bill is delivered to parliament, Barnier's new finance minister will have to fend off attempts to radically rewrite it amid calls from the left for broad-based tax hikes. The budget bill's likely rocky progress through parliament will probably take the rest of the year, with a final vote usually in the course of December. If opposition parties are not satisfied, they can call a vote of confidence, putting Barnier's government at risk of being toppled.

Moderation will be handled by ABC News anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis. The event will be broadcast live on ABC's network, as well as on ABC News Live, Disney+, and Hulu. Other networks will also carry the debate live, ensuring broad coverage and accessibility. Location and Significance The venue for this pivotal debate is the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, a location chosen for its symbolic and strategic importance. Pennsylvania, the state hosting the debate, is a key battleground. Trump recently held a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he narrowly avoided an assassination attempt. Harris, on the other hand, used Philadelphia as the backdrop for unveiling Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate in August. Pennsylvaniaâ€™s electoral votes were critical in Bidenâ€™s 2020 victory, overcoming Trumpâ€™s 2016 win in the state, which highlights the significance of this swing state in the current election cycle. Debate Format and Rules This debate will be the first time Harris and Trump meet on stage together. For Harris, this marks her first debate appearance since 2020, when she debated then-Vice President Mike Pence amidst COVID-19 restrictions. The debate format will follow the same rules as the previous June debate, including muted microphones for each candidate while the other is speaking, no live audience, and no use of written notes. These rules were contentious; Bidenâ€™s campaign had initially insisted on mic muting to prevent interruptions, a decision some now regret for limiting Trumpâ€™s unfiltered responses. Harrisâ€™ campaign pushed for all microphones to remain live, reflecting a desire for a more transparent debate. Future Debates As of now, there are no additional debates scheduled between Harris and Trump. However, the campaign will feature a vice presidential debate on October 1, hosted by CBS News in New York City. This debate will pit Walz against Trumpâ€™s running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, offering voters another opportunity to gauge the candidatesâ€™ positions and strategies. In summary, the upcoming debate represents a crucial moment in the 2024 election campaign, with both candidates seeking to sway voters in a key swing state. The format and setting of the debate will play a significant role in shaping the final weeks of the campaign.

""EASA is taking precautionary measures to prevent any further similar occurrence,"" the agency said. ""We will require a one-time fleet inspection, which may be applicable only to a portion of the A350 fleet."" Hong Kong-based Cathay, one of the largest operators of the A350 jetliner, grounded 48 planes for checks on Monday after a Zurich-bound flight had to return to the city shortly after take-off. Inspections found defective engine fuel lines requiring replacement on 15 of the A350s powered by Rolls-Royce engines, forcing the cancellation of dozens of flights in Asia. EASA indicated in a statement an engine fire had been behind the Zurich-bound flight having to turn back. ""An A350-1041 aircraft operated by Cathay Pacific on flight CX383 from Hong Kong to Zurich experienced an in-flight engine fire shortly after take-off,"" EASA said, adding the fire was ""promptly detected and extinguished."" The agency said the incident was the subject of a safety investigation led by the Air Accident Investigation Authority of Hong Kong (AAIA) and added it is taking ""precautionary measures to prevent any further similar occurrence."" EASA said the inspections would seek to ""identify and remove from service any potentially compromised high pressure fuel hoses"" and said the compliance time frame was still being determined and would be detailed later Thursday in an EASA Emergency Airworthiness Directive. Cathay had indicated Monday that ""the component was the first of its type to suffer such failure on any A350 aircraft worldwide"". The incident prompted other airlines in the region to carry out similar checks on their A350-900 and A350-1000 models, which are powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-84 and XWB-97 engines, respectively.

46,US Polls 2024: Can Harris prosecute the political case against Trump? Key questions ahead of their debate,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/us-polls-2024-can-harris-prosecute-the-political-case-against-trump-key-questions-ahead-of-their-debate-12815493.html,World,2024-09-05 18:27:00+05:30,"Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will debate for the first and perhaps, last time on Tuesday night as the presidential candidates fight to sway voters on the biggest stage in US politics. The meeting comes just 75 days after President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance triggered a political earthquake that ultimately forced him from the race. Few expect such a transformative result this time, but Trump is on a mission to end Harris' â€śhoneymoonâ€ť as polls suggest the Democratic vice president is now even â€” or slightly ahead â€” of the Republican former president in some swing states. Harris, a former courtroom prosecutor, will enter the night with relatively high expectations against a Republican opponent with 34 felony convictions and a penchant for false statements. The question is whether Harris, who did not particularly stand out during primary debates in her 2020 presidential campaign, can prosecute Trump's glaring liabilities in a face-to-face meeting on live television with the world watching. The 90-minute meeting begins at 9 p.m. ET Tuesday inside Philadelphia's National Constitutional Center. It will be moderated by ABC News anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis. In accordance with rules negotiated by both campaigns, there will be no live audience. Hereâ€™s what weâ€™re watching for on a historic night: Biden set an incredibly low bar for Harris in the June 27 debate. The president struggled to offer coherent arguments or even finish his sentences. But the anti-Trump coalition was most disappointed that he failed to take advantage of Trump's obvious political liabilities â€” whether on abortion, the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, character issues or his legal trouble. Harris is expected to do much better. But even with such fertile terrain, scoring points against Trump on the debate stage is easier said than done. Trump may be the most experienced debater in modern presidential history. As a former reality television star, he knows how to dominate television coverage. And he clearly likes to fight. Harris recently suggested that she may be looking forward to a political brawl. â€śDonald,â€ť she told a cheering audience last month in Atlanta, â€śif you've got something to say, say it to my face.â€ť Can she back up the tough talk? The world is about to find out. Trump is not known for his discipline or preparation. His debate performances, like his governing style, are typically fueled much more by instinct than thoughtful analysis. Therefore, few expect Trump to offer a clear and concise line of attack against Harris on Tuesday night. Still, he needs to do better than the kitchen-sink approach he's been testing on the campaign trail for much of the last month. Trump has questioned Harris' racial identity. He's falsely called her a communist. He's questioned her strength. He's jabbed her as a San Francisco liberal. And he's reminded voters that she has served in the Biden White House for nearly four years and would presumably continue the president's policies for another four years if she wins. It is the Biden connection that many Republicans, inside and outside of Trump's campaign, believe is most effective. They want him to evoke Ronald Reagan's 1980 debate-stage jab â€” â€śAre you better off?â€ť â€” early and often. The question is whether Trump can deliver that message in a way that isn't immediately overshadowed by a much more controversial statement. Recent history offers reasons to be skeptical. There will, of course, be an obvious gender dynamic on stage Tuesday night. Fair or not, body language and tone are viewed differently in a debate between a man and a woman. Just ask Hillary Clinton. She said Trump made her â€śskin crawlâ€ť when he stood behind her as she was speaking during a town hall-style debate in 2016. The candidates will be expected to stay behind their podiums on Tuesday night. But Republicans are hopeful that Trump will avoid any other provocations like pointing, yelling or otherwise approaching Harris in a way that might be off-putting to suburban women or other swing voters. Harris, too, will face unique challenges related to her race and gender as voters consider whether to make her the nation's first female president. Some voters still say they're not comfortable with the idea. If she comes across as angry, she risks playing into racist tropes about Black women. While the gender dynamic looms, do not underestimate the significance of their age difference, either. Harris is almost two decades younger than the 78-year-old Trump. Age was viewed as a political advantage for Trump when he was facing the 81-year-old Biden, but the situation is now reversed against the 59-year-old Harris. If he wins, Trump would be the oldest US president ever elected. The format will be somewhat different as well, in accordance with a set of rules the candidates agreed upon this week. There will be no live audience, no opening statements and no props allowed. Candidatesâ€™ microphones will be muted when their opponent is on the clock, a stipulation that created some controversy in recent days. Trump reluctantly agreed to the mute function when he faced Biden in June, but after that debate, his team determined it was a net positive if voters did not hear from the Republican former president while his opponent was speaking. Harris' team was pushing to return to a normal format without mute buttons. Policy sometimes plays second to personality in presidential debates, but there are dramatic differences between the candidates on key issues that are on the minds of millions of voters. Republicans hope Trump makes immigration a defining issue of the debate. The GOP has effectively condemned the Biden administration's handling of illegal immigration at the US-Mexico border for much of the last four years. Once an issue that appealed mostly to the Republican base, illegal immigration â€” and related concerns about drugs, crime and national security â€” is now a top issue for voters across the political spectrum. Harris will be eager to remind voters that Trump helped kill a bipartisan immigration bill that would have done much to fix the problem. But overall, Harris is likely to be on the defensive when the issue comes up. Democrats, meanwhile, want to focus on abortion. Trump, of course, appointed three Supreme Court justices who later overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that protected a woman's right to choose abortion. Trump has repeatedly said he was proud that Roe was defeated. But aware that such a view isn't popular among many women, he has tried to moderate his stance on the divisive issue. Harris won't make that easy. Stating the obvious, as a woman, she is positioned to be a much more effective messenger on the issue than Biden was. And Trump can't afford to lose many more female voters. If you ask Trump's previous debate opponents what they're watching for on Tuesday night â€” and we did â€” many say the same thing: Look out for the thing he says or does that Harris can't possibly prepare for. Trump is the ultimate wild card who has found tremendous political success by ignoring the traditional rules of politics. He will say or do whatever he thinks is best in the moment. And Harris, who has dedicated several days to debate prep, can't make a plan for everything. At this point, it's hard to imagine Trump surprising anyone with new material. He has praised dictators, talked about genitalia size, suggested suspending the US Constitution and said that Harris only recently â€śturned Black.â€ť Trump's own team doesn't know what he'll do or say on any given day. That's incredibly risky for Trump. But it also puts enormous pressure on Harris.

47,President Emmanuel Macron appoints Michel Barnier as Franceâ€™s new prime minister,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/macron-appoints-michel-barnier-as-frances-new-prime-minister-12815404.html,World,2024-09-05 19:54:00+05:30,"President Emmanuel Macron named EU former Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier as Franceâ€™s new prime minister on Thursday after more than 50 days of caretaker government. The appointment of Barnier follows weeks of intense efforts by Macron and his aides to find a candidate who might be able to build loose groupings of backers in parliament and survive possible attempts by Macronâ€™s opponents to quickly topple the new government that Barnier is now tasked to put together and lead.Le Prsident de la Rpublique a nomm Monsieur Michel BARNIER Premier ministre. Il la charg de constituer un gouvernement de rassemblement au service du pays et des Franais. pic.twitter.com/beWhuEh42Llyse (@Elysee) September 5, 2024 Barnier, 73, the oldest premier in the history of modern France, has been tasked with forming ""a unifying government in the service of the country"", it said. In a striking contrast, the former foreign minister succeeds Gabriel Attal, 35, a man less than half his age and who served only eight months in office. The appointment of the veteran politician, a member of the right-wing Republicans (LR) party and not affiliated to Macron's centrist faction, was greeted with dismay by the left which may seek to topple him with a no-confidence motion. A left-wing coalition emerged as France's biggest political force after the elections earlier this summer but with not enough seats for an overall majority. Macron's centrist faction and the far right make up the two other major groups in the National Assembly. Conservative ex-minister Xavier Bertrand and former Socialist prime minister Bernard Cazeneuve had been seen as the initial favourites to become premier, but both figures fell by the wayside with the mathematics of France's new parliament stacked against them. In France, the president names the prime minster, who can then be censured by the lower house in a no confidence motion. Marine Le Pen 'decides' But Barnier, a right-winger and the European Union's former negotiator on Brexit, was Thursday lunch time seen emerging from talks at the Elysee with Macron to make a dramatic return to frontline politics as premier. He has been all but invisible in French political life since failing to win his party's nomination to challenge Macron for the presidency in 2022 during a campaign where he tacked further right and suggested a moratorium on immigration. The veteran former foreign minister and EU commissioner is ""Macron-compatible"" and would not be immediately voted out by parliament, an advisor to the president told AFP, asking not to be named. A minister in the outgoing government, who also asked not to be named, said he was ""very popular with right-wing members of parliament without being an irritant on the left"". Macron appears to be counting on the far-right National Rally (RN) of three-time presidential candidate Marine Le Pen not to topple Barnier if a no confidence motion is tabled. ""We will wait to see Mr Barnier's policy speech"" to parliament, said Le Pen, the leader in parliament of the RN, the party with the most seats in the lower house following the snap polls. RN party leader Jordan Bardella said Barnier would be judged ""on evidence"" when he addressed parliament. The composition of the new cabinet will be closely watched for signs of concessions to Macron's political foes. Greens leader Marine Tondelier earlier commented: ""We know in the end who decides. Her name is Marine Le Pen. She is the one to whom Macron has decided to submit."" 'Tough' task Hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, whose Unbowed party (LFI) and allies belong to a left-wing bloc, said Macron naming Barnier meant the election had been ""stolen from the French"". Macron's decision comes under the gun of a deadline to submit a draft 2025 budget for France's strained government finances before October 1. It also marks his attempt to acknowledge rejection of his seven-year rule without giving up on hard-fought reforms, chief among them last year's widely resented increase to the official retirement age to 64 from 62. Barnier's ""task looks tough, but difficulty has never scared him,"" said former prime minister Edouard Philippe who earlier this week announced he would seek to succeed Macron in 2027 presidential elections. After the July election deprived Macron of his relative majority in parliament, the centrist president drew out the appointment of a new prime minister for a period unprecedented since World War II, through the July-August Olympic Games and beyond. Speaking to Le Figaro daily and using rugby parlance, Attal expressed hope his successor could ""convert the try"" of the policies whose implementation he could not complete during his time in office. Here are a few key facts about Barnier:1951 - Born Jan. 9 in La Tronche, a suburb of the French Alpine city of Grenoble.1978 - Elected to parliament aged 27, representing the Gaullist, centre-right Savoie district.1992 - Co-organiser of Winter Olympics held at Albertville in his constituency, an event still central to his public image.1993-95 - Environment minister.1995-97 - France's Europe minister.1999-2004 - EU regional policy commissioner, responsible for grants and subsidies accounting for a third of the Union's budget.2004-05 - Foreign minister.2007-09 - Agriculture minister.2009-10 - EU lawmaker.2010-14 - EU commissioner for internal market and services. Negotiated extensive new regulation of financial markets after the global crash, including reforms unpopular in the City of London.2016 - Named EU's Brexit negotiator after Britain's referendum on leaving the bloc.2021 - Failed in a bid to get his conservative party's nomination for the 2022 presidential election.(Inputs from agencies)

Attorney General Merrick Garland also announced the seizure of 32 internet domains that were part of an alleged campaign ""to secure Russia's preferred outcome,"" which US officials have said would be Donald Trump winning the November vote. ""We have no tolerance for attempts by authoritarian regimes to exploit our democratic system of government,"" Garland said at a meeting of the Justice Department's Election Threats Task Force. ""We will be relentlessly aggressive in countering and disrupting attempts by Russia and Iran -- as well as China or any other foreign malign actor -- to interfere in our elections,"" he said. The 10 individuals and two entities sanctioned by the Treasury Department include RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan and her deputy Elizaveta Brodskaia. Simonyan was a ""central figure in Russian government malign influence efforts,"" the Treasury Department said, while Brodskaia ""reported to Russian President (Vladimir) Putin and other government officials."" Garland said two Russia-based RT employees -- Kostiantyn Kalashnikov, 31, and Elena Afanasyeva, 27, have been indicted in New York for money laundering and violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act. They are accused of funneling $10 million to a Tennessee-based company that used social media influencers ""to create and distribute content to US audiences with hidden Russian government messaging,"" Garland said. The US firm, which was not identified, published English-language videos on multiple social media channels, including TikTok, Instagram, X, and YouTube, according to the indictment. ""The company never disclosed to the influencersÂ  or to their millions of followers, its ties to RT and the Russian government,"" Garland said. RT, in a reaction on its Telegram channel, dismissed the US allegations calling them ""hackneyed cliches."" ""Three things in life are inevitable: death, taxes and 'RT's interference in American elections,'"" said RT, formerly known as Russia Today. Putin's 'inner circle' National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said RT was aiming to ""covertly spread Russian government propaganda with the aim of reducing international support for Ukraine, bolstering pro-Russian policies and interests and influencing voters here in the US and in foreign elections as well."" Garland said the seized internet domains were used by the Russian government ""to engage in a covert campaign to interfere and influence the outcome of our country's elections."" He said the influence campaign involved members of Putin's ""inner circle"" and the Kremlin's goal, according to an internal planning document, ""is to secure Russiaâ€™s preferred outcome in the election."" The attorney general declined to specify what that outcome was but US intelligence officials suggested in July that the Kremlin once again favors Trump over his Democratic opponents, as it did in the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. US officials have repeatedly warned of efforts by foreign powers to meddle in the upcoming US election, and Washington has accused Moscow of seeking to influence US elections dating back to the 2016 contest between Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, in an appearance before a Senate committee in May, singled out Russia, China and Iran as the worst offenders. ""Specifically, Russia remains the most active foreign threat to our elections,"" Haines said.

In an interview with PTI at his official residence here, Yunus said the attacks on minorities in Bangladesh are more political than communal. He suggested that the attacks were not communal, but a fallout of a political upheaval as there is a perception that most Hindus supported the now-deposed Awami League regime. â€śI have said this to (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi also that this is exaggerated. This issue has several dimensions. When the country went through an upheaval following the atrocities by (Sheikh) Hasina and the Awami League, those who were with them also faced attacks,â€ť the Nobel laureate told PTI. The minority Hindu population faced vandalism of their businesses and properties, as well as the destruction of Hindu temples, during the student-led violence that erupted following the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. After unprecedented anti-government protests that peaked on August 5, Hasina resigned as prime minister and fled to India. â€śNow, while beating up Awami League cadres, they had beaten up Hindus as there is a perception that Hindus in Bangladesh mean Awami League supporters. I am not saying that what has happened is right, but some people are using it as an excuse to seize property. So, there is no clear distinction between Awami League supporters and Hindus,â€ť he said. In his first direct contact with New Delhi last month, shortly after becoming the head of Bangladesh's interim government, Yunus conveyed to Prime Minister Modi that Dhaka would prioritise the protection and safety of Hindus and all other minority groups. During the conversation, Modi reaffirmed India's support for a democratic, stable, peaceful, and progressive Bangladesh and emphasised the importance of ensuring the safety of Hindus and other minority communities in the violence-hit country. Hindus, who made up 22 per cent of Bangladesh's population at the time of the 1971 Liberation War, now constitute about 8 per cent of 170 million and have predominantly supported the Awami League, known for its secular stance. Describing the attacks as more political than communal, Yunus questioned the manner in which India is â€śpropagatingâ€ť them. â€śThese attacks are political in nature and not communal. And India is propagating these incidents in a big way. We have not said that we canâ€™t do anything; we have said that we are doing everything,â€ť the Chief Adviser said. Prime Minister Modi, in his Independence Day address from the Red Fort on August 15, expressed hope that the situation in violence-hit Bangladesh would return to normal soon and said 1.4 billion Indians are concerned about the safety of Hindus and minorities in the neighbouring country. Discussing the future of India-Bangladesh relations, Yunus expressed a desire for good ties with India but insisted that New Delhi must abandon the narrative that Bangladesh will turn into another Afghanistan without Sheikh Hasina at the helm. â€śThe way forward is for India to come out of the narrative. The narrative is that everybody is Islamist, BNP is Islamist, and everyone else is Islamist and will make this country into Afghanistan. And Bangladesh is in safe hands with Sheikh Hasina at the helm only. â€śIndia is captivated by this narrative. India needs to come out of this narrative. Bangladesh, like any other nation, is just another neighbour,â€ť he said. The noted economist added, â€śThe issue of trying to portray the conditions of minorities in such a big way is just an excuse.â€ť Yunus said that when he met leaders of the minority community, he urged them to protest as citizens of the country with equal rights and not merely as Hindus. â€śEven when I met members of the Hindu community, I had requested them: please donâ€™t identify yourselves as Hindus; rather, you should say you are citizens of this country and you have equal rights. If someone tries to snatch your legal rights as citizens, then there are remedies,â€ť he said. The Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council (BHBCUC), a prominent Hindu minority group in Bangladesh, had also reported attacks on minorities, especially Hindus, following the fall of Sheikh Hasinaâ€™s government on August 5. Thousands of Hindus staged protest rallies in Bangladesh's capital and the northeastern port city of Chattogram on August 10-11, demanding protection amid nationwide vandalism that saw attacks on temples and their homes and businesses. Earlier in August, the Bangladesh National Hindu Grand Alliance said that the minority Hindu community faced attacks and threats in 278 locations across 48 districts since the fall of the Hasina-led government and termed it as an â€śassault on the Hindu religion.â€ť

The tropical storm is strengthening into a super typhoon and barreling straight for the holiday island province of Hainan. This week, Typhoon Yagi triggered floods and landslides on the main Philippine island of Luzon, leaving at least 13 dead, according to official figures. According to China's Xinhua news agency, the tropical storm intensified into a super typhoon as it tracked west across the South China Sea, packing winds of up to 209 kilometres (130 miles) per hour as it headed for Hainan. ""Hainan upgraded its emergency response to Yagi to the highest level at 11:30 am Thursday, according to the provincial disaster management authority,"" Xinhua said. The typhoon is expected to make landfall on Friday afternoon in either Hainan or neighbouring Guangdong. Work, school and local transport services were suspended from Thursday noon (0400 GMT) in Haikou, Hainan's capital. In Hong Kong, which Yagi is expected to bypass, the weather observatory said it will issue the city's third-highest typhoon warning at 6:20 pm (1020 GMT), limiting public transport across the finance hub. Classes at kindergarten and special schools in Hong Kong were suspended Thursday, while budget airline Hong Kong Express said six flights have been rescheduled. Greater Bay Airlines said they would cancel four flights and reschedule two more due to the weather. ""Yagi will remain at super typhoon intensity and skirt around 300 kilometres (186 miles) to the southwest of Hong Kong tomorrow morning,"" the observatory said. ""Gale winds associated with Yagi are expected to affect the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary tonight and tomorrow morning."" After southern China, Yagi will move towards Vietnam, on course to hit the northern and north-central regions around the famed UNESCO heritage site Halong Bay. Vietnam's meteorological agency issued a storm warning on Thursday, and the government mobilised more than 2,700 military personnel for storm response. Coastal provinces are planning a sailing ban on Friday, while Vietnam's mountainous provinces were ordered to prepare rescue vehicles. (With agency inputs) ",NA

Putin was speaking a day after the US Justice Department charged two Russian media executives over an alleged illegal scheme to influence the November election with pro-Russian propaganda. The Kremlin leader had said earlier this year, before President Joe Biden withdrew from the race â€“ also with apparent irony â€“ that he preferred him over Trump because Biden was a more predictable ""old school"" politician. Asked how he viewed the election now, Putin told an economic forum in Russia's far east that it was the choice of the American people. But he then added that as Biden had recommended his supporters to back Harris, ""we will do the same, we will support her"". ""She laughs so expressively and infectiously that it means that everything is fine with her,"" Putin said, adding that maybe this meant she would refrain from further sanctions against Russia. US intelligence agencies believe Russia wants Trump to win because he is less committed to supporting Ukraine in the war against Russia. But Putin said Trump, as president, had introduced more sanctions against Russia than anyone in the White House before him.

The latest wake-up call came from elections in the eastern states of Saxony and Thuringia, the latter of which the far-right Alternative for Germany won outright â€” a troubling post-war first for a party whose local leader has used banned Nazi slogans in speeches. More telling, though, was the suddenÂ successÂ of the far-left SahraÂ Wagenknecht Alliance, launched only in January to ride the same wave of popular discontent that has fueled the AfDâ€™s rise. The result suggests that voters are simply fed up with the status quo, not longing for the fascist past. Their dissatisfaction is understandable. Just a decade ago, Germany was in the European vanguard. Its export-oriented economic modelÂ deliveredÂ impressive growth. Its efforts to combat climate change led the world. When then-Chancellor Angela Merkel made the monumental (and controversial) decision to welcome almost a million mainly Syrian refugees, her promise that â€śweâ€™ll manage thisâ€ť was believable. Now the economy is in the doldrums â€” thanks in part to a war-related energy-price shock and growing competition from China, butÂ alsoÂ to abundant red tape and a long-running lack of public investment in infrastructure. National champion Volkswagen AG is considering the first German plant closures in its 87-year history. Trains donâ€™t run onÂ time. On the green front, ham-handed efforts to promote everything from heat pumps to ecologically friendly farming have stoked anger among homeowners and farmers alike. DespiteÂ progressÂ in integrating refugees, people increasingly see immigration as a problem â€” a situation worsened by a recent spate of violent crimes allegedlyÂ committedÂ by foreigners.  Germanyâ€™s mainstream parties need to unite around a plan to break out of the malaise and convince voters that theyâ€™re capable of following through. This should include a new economic model focused on investing in productivity, unleashing domestic demand and attracting private capital. It requires bringing a burdensome and unduly paper-based bureaucracy into the 21st century. And it entails making the case for immigrants â€” desperately needed to bolster an aging labor force â€” to a skeptical populace. The current ruling coalition â€” an uneasy mix of Chancellor Olaf Scholzâ€™s center-left Social Democrats, Finance Minister Christian Lindnerâ€™s center-right Free Democrats and Economy Minister Robert Habeckâ€™s Greens â€” hasnâ€™t proven up to the task. Although theyâ€™ve laid outÂ plansÂ to revive growth, they canâ€™t even agree on a fiscal policy that would allow for the necessary public investment. Scholz has been making tactical sops to extremists, such as tightening asylum requirements and limiting support for Ukraine. So far, mainstream partiesâ€™ refusal to cooperate with the AfD will probably keep it out of power in Thuringia. The same might happen at the next federal elections, scheduled for September 2025. But such firewalls â€” or an outright ban of the AfD, as some have proposed â€” wonâ€™t stop the rot. If centrists want to win the country back from the extremists, theyâ€™ll have to come up with something more inspiring. Credit: BloombergÂ  ",NA

Putin said China, India and Brazil could act as mediators in potential peace talks. The President said a preliminary agreement reached between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators in the first weeks of the war at talks in Istanbul, which was never implemented, could serve as the basis for talks, Reuters reported. ""We understand who we are dealing withÂ  - with people who don't respect agreements,"" Putin said. In July this year,Â Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Russia to meet President Putin. The visit came two and half years after the conflict with Ukraine began and various topics includingÂ the warÂ were discussed by the two leaders. PM Modi also visited Ukraine in AugustÂ and became the first Indian PM to visit the nation since diplomatic relations were established between the two countries in 1992. During his visit, he met President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the two leaders discussed a wide range of topics, including peace, economic cooperation, culture, and defense. Meanwhile, Putin confirmed that Russia is turning more and more towards the East, and moving away from the West. ""Over a thousand agreements worth over 10.5 trillion rubles were signed at the last three Eastern Economic Forum (EEF),"" he said. Modiâ€™s 'friendly' ties with Putin to help US-Ukraine-Russia peace efforts, says Kremlin ""More than 30 countries are showing readiness to join or cooperate with BRICS.""Â  Putin further said the West already understands that they made a mistake by pushing countries to abandon the dollar with their 'stupid' actions. As of now,Â Russia uses national currencies in 65 percent of settlements with BRICS partners, he said. Putin also said that Ukraine's Kursk incursion was aimed at slowing the Russian advance in Donbas but that it had failed as Kyiv had simply weakened its forces along the rest of the front. In the biggest foreign attack on Russian sovereign territory since World War Two, thousands of Ukrainian soldiers smashed through the Russian border on Aug. 6 aided with swarms of drones, heavy weaponry and artillery, some Western made. Putin, speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, said that Ukraine by transferring large and well-trained units into Russia, Ukraine had weakened itself and allowed Russia to accelerate the offensive in eastern Ukraine. Putin said it was Russia's ""sacred duty"" to expel the invaders and that Russian forces were starting to push out Ukrainian troops from Kursk. He said that the Russian advance on the eastern Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk was successful. With inputs from Reuters ",NA

Pyongyang launched about 420 balloons late Wednesday, quickly followed by another round early Thursday, Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said. Around 20 of the balloons had already landed in the South, mainly in northern Gyeonggi province and the capital Seoul, the JCS said. The bags attached to those balloons contained ""mostly paper and plastic waste"", the military said, adding that they posed no safety risk to the public, according to their analysis. This is the thirteenth round of trash-carrying balloons launched by Pyongyang since late May. The latest launch comes as relations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with the North recently announcing the deployment of 250 ballistic missile launchers to its southern border. North Korea has sent more than 3,800 trash-filled balloons southward since May, saying they are retaliation for propaganda balloons launched by South Korean activists. In response, Seoul has suspended a tension-reducing military deal with Pyongyang and restarted some propaganda broadcasts from loudspeakers along the border. South Korean officials held high-level talks with US officials on North Korea deterrence on Wednesday. ""North Korea has not stopped advancing its nuclear and missile capabilities and has recently continued to provoke by disturbing the GPS system or launching trash balloons,"" Kim Hong-kyun, South Korea's vice minister of foreign affairs, told reporters. ""In this situation, the two countries cannot rule out the possibility of North Korea making a major provocation before and after the U.S. presidential election,"" he added.

Speaking from Russia where he is on an official trip, Anwar asserted that Malaysia's exploration activities were within its territory. They were not intended to be provocative or hostile towards China, with whom it has friendly relations. During a televised presser the PM said,""Of course, we will have to operate in our waters and secure economic advantage, including drilling for oil, in our territory."" ""We have never denied the possibility of discussion (with China). But it doesn't mean we have to stop the operation in our area."", he further added. Meanwhile, Malaysia's foreign ministry on Wednesday said it would investigate the leak of a classified diplomatic note from the Chinese Foreign Ministry. In the note, which was carried by a Philippine news outlet, Beijing asserted that Malaysia's oil and gas exploration in the South China Sea breached its territory. China claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea, including parts of the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam, complicating energy exploration efforts by several of those countries. Under international law, an EEZ does not denote sovereignty, but grants a country sovereign rights to extract natural resources from those waters. Malaysian state energy firm Petronas, or Petroliam Nasional Berhad, operates oil and gas fields in the South China Sea within Malaysia's EEZ and has in recent years had several encounters with Chinese vessels. Anwar said China has sent ""one or two"" protest notes to stop Malaysia's oil exploration activities, without specifying details, but stressed that the government would continue to explain to Beijing its position. ""We have said that we will not transgress other people's borders. That is our stringent policy and principles,"" he said. ""They know our position.... They have claimed that we are infringing on their territory. That is not the case. We say no, it is our territory."" ""But if they continue with the dispute, then okay, we will have to listen, and they will have to listen."" An international arbitration tribunal in The Hague in 2016 ruled China's claim to about 90% of the South China Sea, made via a U-shaped ""nine-dash line"" on its maps, had no basis under international law, a decision Beijing does not recognise.

60,"Seeking an alternative to China's pressure-cooker schools, families move to Thailand",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/seeking-an-alternative-to-chinas-pressure-cooker-schools-families-move-to-thailand-12814828.html,World,2024-09-05 10:52:00+05:30,"The competition started in second grade for DJ Wang's son. Eight-year-old William was enrolled at a top elementary school in Wuhan, a provincial capital in central China. While kindergarten and first grade were relatively carefree, the homework assignments started piling up in second grade. By third grade, his son was regularly finishing his day around midnight. â€śYou went from traveling lightly to carrying a very heavy burden,â€ť Wang said. â€śThat sudden switch, it was very hard to bear.â€ť Wang, who traveled often to Chiang Mai in northern Thailand for his job in tourism, decided to make a switch, moving his family to the city that sits at the base of mountains. The family is among a wave of Chinese flocking to Thailand for its quality international schools and more relaxed lifestyle. While there are no records tracking how many are moving abroad for education, they join other Chinese expats leaving the country, from wealthy entrepreneurs moving to Japan to protect their wealth, to activists unhappy with the political system, to young people who want to opt out of China's ultra-competitive work culture, at least for a while. Jenson Zhang, who runs an education consultancy, Vision Education, for Chinese parents looking to move to Southeast Asia, said many middle-class families choose Thailand because schools are cheaper than private schools in cities like Beijing and Shanghai. â€śSoutheast Asia, it's within reach, the visa is convenient and the overall environment, as well as people's attitude towards Chinese people, it allows Chinese parents to feel more secure,â€ť Zhang said. A 2023 survey by private education company New Oriental found Chinese families also increasingly considering Singapore and Japan for their children's overseas study. But tuition and the cost of living are much higher than in Thailand. Within Thailand, the slow-paced city of Chiang Mai often ends up being the top choice. Other options include Pattaya and Phuket, both popular beach resorts, and Bangkok, though the capital is usually more expensive. The trend has been ongoing for about a decade, but in recent years it's gathered pace. Lanna International School, one of Chiang Mai's more selective schools, saw a peak of interest in the 2022-2023 academic year, with inquiries doubling from a year earlier. â€śParents were really in a rush, they wanted to quickly change to a new school environment"" because of pandemic restrictions, said Grace Hu, an admissions officer at Lanna International, whose position helping Chinese parents through the process was created in 2022. Du Xuan of Vision Education says parents coming to Chiang Mai fall into two types: Those who planned in advance what education they want for their kids, and those who experienced difficulties with the competitive Chinese education system. The majority are from the second group, she said. In Chinese society, many value education to the point where one parent may give up their job and rent an apartment near their child's school to cook and clean for them, and ensure their life runs smoothly. Known as â€śpeidu,â€ť or â€śaccompanied studying,â€ť the goal is academic excellence, often at the expense of the parent's own life. That concept has become twisted by the sheer pressure it takes to keep up. Chinese society has come up with popular buzzwords to describe this hyper-competitive environment, from â€śneijuanâ€ť â€” which roughly translated means the rat race that leads to burnout â€” or â€śtang ping,"" rejecting it all to drop out, or ""lie flat.â€ť The terms reflect what success looks like in modern China, from the hours of cramming required for students to succeed on their exams to the money parents spend hiring tutors to give their kids an extra edge in school. The driving force behind it all is numbers. In a country of 1.4 billion people, success is viewed as graduation from a good college. With a limited number of seats, class rank and test scores matter, especially on the college entrance exams known as the â€śgaokao.â€ť â€śIf you have something, it means someone else can't have that,â€ť said Vision Education's Du, whose own daughters attend school in Chiang Mai. ""We have a saying about the gaokao: One point will topple 10,000 people.' The competition is that intense.â€ť Wang said his son William was praised by his second-grade teacher in Wuhan as gifted, but to stand out in a class of 50 kids and continue to get that level of attention would mean giving money and gifts to the teacher, which other parents were already doing before he was even aware of the need. Back in Wuhan, parents are expected to know the material covered in extracurricular tutoring classes, as well as what is being taught in school, and ensure their child has mastered it all, Wang said. It's often a full-time job. In Chiang Mai, freed from China's emphasis on rote memorization and hours of homework, students have time to develop hobbies. Jiang Wenhui moved from Shanghai to Chiang Mai last summer. In China, she said, she had accepted that her son, Rodney, would get average grades because of his mild attention deficit disorder. But she could not help thinking twice about her decision to move given how competitive every other family was. â€śIn that environment, you'll still feel anxious,"" she said. ""Should I give it another go?â€ť In China, her energy was devoted toward helping Rodney keep up in school, shuttling him to tutoring and keeping him on top of his coursework, pushing him along every step of the way. In Thailand, Rodney, who's about to start 8th grade, has taken up acoustic guitar and piano, and carries around a notebook to learn new English vocabulary â€” all of it his own choice, Jiang said. â€śHe'd ask me to add an hour of English tutoring. I thought his schedule was too full, and he told me, I want to try and see if it's OK.'â€ť He has time to pursue hobbies and hasn't needed to see a doctor for his attention deficit disorder. After bonding with one of his teachers about snakes, he is raising a pet ball python called Banana. Wang says his son William, who is now 14 and about to enter high school, finishes his homework well before midnight and has developed outside interests. Wang, too, has changed his perspective on education. â€śHere, if he gets a bad grade, I don't think much of it, you just work on it,â€ť he said. â€śIs it the case that if he gets a bad grade, that he will be unable to become a successful adult?"" ""Now, I don't think so.â€ť

61,UN chief warns Africa's inadequate access to debt relief is recipe for social unrest,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/un-chief-warns-africas-inadequate-access-to-debt-relief-is-recipe-for-social-unrest-12814872.html,World,2024-09-05 10:00:00+05:30,"African countries' inadequate access to debt relief and scarce resources is a recipe for social unrest, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Thursday, proposing fresh reforms to the international financial architecture. A growing debt crisis across the 1 billion-strong continent has seen a conflagation of civil unrest in recent months, after protests in Kenya, where police clashed with demonstrators rallying against proposed tax hikes, inspired people to take to the streets in Nigeria and Uganda over the cost of living. African nations have been seeking to restructure their debts through a rework architecture designed by the G20 called the 'Common Framework,' but the scheme did not as expected expedite talks between a myriad of leaders from Chinese state-owned banks to London-based asset managers and New York banks. Zambia in June became the first country to successfully restructure its debt through the scheme, more than three years after it defaulted on its loans. Guterres told a major China-Africa cooperation summit in Beijing that Africa's debt ""situation is unsustainable and a recipe for social unrest"". ""They have no access to effective debt relief, scarce resources, and clearly insufficient concessional funding to respond to the basic needs of their population,"" he said. Guterres proposed ""deep reforms to the outdated, ineffective and unfair international financial architecture"" and further stimulus ""to provide developing countries with the liquidity they need while seeking medium- and long-term solutions."" Beijing, the world's biggest bilateral lender, is hosting 50 African nations for the ninth Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Summit this week, at which China's President Xi Jinping pledged 360 billion yuan ($50.70 billion) in fresh financing to the continent over the next three years. China approved loans worth $4.61 billion to Africa last year, the first annual increase since 2016. Guterres praised China's initiatives across Africa and said they could drive a ""renewable energy revolution"" and ""be a catalyst for key transitions on food systems and digital connectivity."" Angola's finance minister on Tuesday told Reuters that Luanda was considering proposals from Beijing, Brussels and elsewhere, with a view to quickly securing funds to help bring down inflation and do more through public-private partnerships.

He is one of tens of thousands of intellectuals, investors and other Chinese who have relocated to Japan in recent years, part of a larger exodus of people from China. Their backgrounds vary widely, and they're leaving for all sorts of reasons. Some are very poor, others are very rich. Some leave for economic reasons, as opportunities dry up with the end of Chinaâ€™s boom. Some flee for personal reasons, as even limited freedoms are eroded. Chinese migrants are flowing to all corners of the world, from workers seeking to start businesses of their own in Mexico to burned-out students heading to Thailand. Those choosing Japan tend to be well-off or highly educated, drawn to the country's ease of living, rich culture and immigration policies that favor highly skilled professionals, with less of the sharp anti-immigrant backlash sometimes seen in Western countries. Jia initially intended to move to the U.S., not Japan. But after experiencing the coronavirus outbreak in China, he was anxious to leave and his American visa application was stuck in processing. So he chose Japan instead. â€śIn the United States, illegal immigration is particularly controversial. When I went to Japan, I was a little surprised. I found that their immigration policy is actually more relaxed than I thought,â€ť Jia told The Associated Press. â€śI found that Japan is better than the U.S."" It's tough to enter the U.S. these days. Tens of thousands of Chinese were arrested at the U.S.-Mexico border over the past year, and Chinese students have been grilled at customs as trade frictions fan suspicions of possible industrial espionage. Some U.S. states passed legislation that restricts Chinese citizens from owning property. â€śThe U.S. is shutting out those Chinese that are friendliest to them, that most share its values,â€ť said Li Jinxing, a Christian human rights lawyer who moved to Japan in 2022. Li sees parallels to about a century ago, when Chinese intellectuals such as Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of modern China, moved to Japan to study how the country modernized so quickly. â€śOn one hand, we hope to find inspiration and direction in history,â€ť Li said of himself and like-minded Chinese in Japan. â€śOn the other hand, we also want to observe what a democratic country with rule of law is like. Weâ€™re studying Japan. How does its economy work, its government work?"" Over the past decade, Tokyo has softened its once-rigid stance against immigration, driven by low birthrates and an aging population. Foreigners now make up about 2% of its population of 125 million. That's expected to jump to 12% by 2070, according to the Tokyo-based National Institute of Population and Social Security Research. Chinese are the most numerous newcomers, at 822,000 last year among more than 3 million foreigners living in Japan, according to government data. That's up from 762,000 a year ago and 649,000 a decade ago. In 2022, the lockdowns under Chinaâ€™s â€śzero COVIDâ€ť policies led many of the country's youth or most affluent citizens to hit the exits. Thereâ€™s even a buzzword for that: â€śrunxue,â€ť using the English word â€śrunâ€ť to evoke â€śrunning awayâ€ť to places seen as safer and more prosperous. For intellectuals like Li and Jia, Japan offers greater freedoms than under Chinese leader Xi Jinpingâ€™s increasingly repressive rule. But for others, such as wealthy investors and business people, Japan offers something else: property protections. A report by investment migration firm Henley & Partners says nearly 14,000 millionaires left China last year, the most of any country in the world, with Japan a popular destination. A major driver is worries about the security of their wealth in China or Hong Kong, said Q. Edward Wang, a professor of Asian studies at Rowan University in Glassboro, New Jersey. â€śProtection of private property, which is the cornerstone of a capitalist society, that piece is missing in China,â€ť Wang said. The weakening yen makes buying property and other local assets in Japan a bargain. And while the Japanese economy has stagnated, Chinaâ€™s once-sizzling economy is also in a rut, with the property sector in crisis and stock prices stuck at the level they were in the late 2000s. â€śIf you are just going to Japan to preserve your money,â€ť Wang said, â€śthen definitely you will enjoy your time in Japan.â€ť Dot.com entrepreneurs are among those leaving China after Communist Party crackdowns on the technology industry, including billionaire Jack Ma, a founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba, who took a professorship at Tokyo College, part of the prestigious University of Tokyo. So many wealthy Chinese have bought apartments in Tokyo's luxury high-rises that some areas have been dubbed â€śChinatowns,â€ť or â€śDigital Chinatownsâ€ť â€” a nod to the many owners' work in high-tech industries. â€śLife in Japan is good,â€ť said Guo Yu, an engineer who retired early after working at ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok. Guo doesn't concern himself with politics. He's keen on Japan's powdery snow in the winter and is a â€śsuperfanâ€ť of its beautiful hot springs. He owns homes in Tokyo, as well as near a ski resort and a hot spring. He owns several cars, including a Porsche, a Mercedes, a Tesla and a Toyota. Guo keeps busy with a new social media startup in Tokyo and a travel agency specializing in â€śonsen,â€ť Japan's hot springs. Most of his employees are Chinese, he said. Like Guo, many Chinese moving to Japan are wealthy and educated. That's for good reason: Japan remains unwelcoming to refugees and many other types of foreigners. The government has been strategic about who it allows to stay, generally focusing on people to fill labor shortages for factories, construction and elder care. â€śIt is crucial that Japan becomes an attractive country for foreign talent so they will choose to work here,â€ť Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said earlier this year, announcing efforts to relax Japan's stringent immigration restrictions. That kind of opportunity is exactly what Chinese ballet dancer Du Hai said he has found. Leading a class of a dozen Japanese students in a suburban Tokyo studio one recent weekend, Du demonstrated positions and spins to the women dressed in leotards and toe shoes. Du was drawn to Japan's huge ballet scene, filled with professional troupes and talented dancers, he said, but worried about warnings he got about unfriendly Japanese.

US Attorney General Merrick Garland revealed that the charges relate to Russiaâ€™s use of state-run media to enlist unwitting American influencers in spreading propaganda and disinformation. Two Russian nationals now face criminal charges, and sanctions have been imposed on 10 individuals and entities. Authorities also seized 32 internet domains linked to the operation. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco stated that at the direction of Russian President Vladimir Putin, three Russian companies used fake social media profiles to push false narratives. Internal documents from one of these companies, as cited in an FBI affidavit, revealed that one of the goals was to boost the candidacy of Donald Trump or any Republican nominee seen as favourable to Moscow's interests. The Justice Department's indictment, unsealed in New Yorkâ€™s Southern District, accuses two RT (formerly Russia Today) employees of funnelling nearly $10 million to this unidentified firm, referred to as 'Company 1' in court filings. The money was reportedly used to produce and distribute content favourable to pro-Russian narratives. One Tennessee-based media company, Tenet Media, was identified as a key player in the operation, according to CNN. Allegedly funded by Kremlin operatives, the company is connected to prominent right-wing commentators with millions of followers on social media. Margarita Simonyan, the head of RT, was among the 10 individuals sanctioned. US officials accuse her of orchestrating a campaign aimed at undermining public trust in American institutions. RT has denied the allegations. White House National Security spokesman John Kirby said that the Russian influence campaign was designed to erode international support for Ukraine while promoting pro-Russian policies in the U.S. Additionally, a Treasury Department official confirmed that Russian media outlets covertly recruited American influencers to unknowingly assist in their disinformation efforts. These actions mark a coordinated effort by the Justice, State, and Treasury departments to ""aggressively counter"" foreign interference in US elections. (With inputs from agencies) ",NA

The dollar steadied. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.5% after falling more than 2% on Wednesday, its biggest drop since the August 5 rout. South Koreaâ€™s Kospi jumped more than 1%, led by a rebound in the shares of chipmakers. Japanâ€™s benchmarks fluctuated following the yenâ€™s strength. Treasuries were steady after the 10-year yield dropped eight basis points in the prior session, as a slowdown in the US labor market bolstered bets on steep rate cuts by the Fed. The move weakened an index of dollar strength by 0.3% on Wednesday, and supported gains in Australian and New Zealand bonds. Global financial markets have displayed outsized reactions to US economic data as doubts grow over the Fedâ€™s ability to engineer a soft landing. Skepticism over the artificial intelligence hype has also hurt risk assets, with Nvidia Corp. seeing its worst two-day plunge since October 2022. Focus now turns to the US payrolls data due Friday, one of the most important data points before the Fedâ€™s decision later this month. â€śThe markets may not be as nervous as they were a month ago, but theyâ€™re still looking for confirmation the economy isnâ€™t cooling off too much,â€ť said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. â€śSo far this week, they havenâ€™t gotten it.â€ť US futures edged higher in Asian trading after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 ended Wednesday down 0.2%. The yen pared some of its earlier strength. The currency was supported by a surprise increase in real wages that keeps the Bank of Japan on track for another rate hike. Shares of Nippon Steel Corp. snapped a three-day drop. The Japanese steelmaker is in focus after US President Joe Biden was said to block its $14.1 billion takeover of United States Steel Corp.. Shares of US Steel closed 17% lower in New York, the biggest decline since April 2017. Elsewhere, China is considering cutting interest rates on as much as $5.3 trillion of mortgages as authorities attempt to shore up the battered property market and economy. JPMorgan Chase & Co. dropped its buy recommendation for the nationâ€™s stocks, citing weak policy support and potential volatility linked to the US presidential election. â€śThere is insufficient policy support, both monetary and fiscal,â€ť Claudio Irigoyen, head of global economics research for Bank of America, said on Bloomberg Television. â€śIt is going to be more difficult to achieve the targets of 5% unless we have more policy support.â€ť Meanwhile, the Bank of Korea said its economy shrank as initially estimated in the second quarter. The data gives policymakers added incentive to shift their focus to supporting growth momentum after inflation slowed in line with projections. With the Fed set to begin cutting rates in a few weeks, the main question now is how big the first reduction will be. Monthly US employment data due Friday will help determine the answer. The jobs report last month stoked growth fears and Chair Jerome Powell has made it clear the Fed is now more concerned about risks to the labor market than inflation. â€śMarkets seem to see September as a coin flip between 25 and 50 basis points,â€ť said Neil Dutta at Renaissance Macro Research. â€śI think going 25 basis points risks the same market dynamic as skipping the July meeting. Itâ€™ll be fine until the next data point makes investors second guess the decision, fueling bets the Fed is behind the curve. Go 50 when you can, not when you must.â€ť In commodities, oil steadied near the lowest close since June 2023 as an industry report pointed to a big draw in US crude stockpiles. Meanwhile, gold traded at around $2,495 after finding support following the US job openings data.

""Until that happens, we're there,"" he told a news conference in Jerusalem. Netanyahu repeated his outright rejection of a withdrawal from the so-called Philadelphi corridor in the first phase of a deal, expected to last 42 days, saying international pressure would make it effectively impossible to return. For a permanent ceasefire to be agreed upon after that, Israel would need guarantees that whoever ran postwar Gaza would be able to prevent the corridor from being used as a route for smuggling weapons and supplies for Hamas. ""Somebody has to be there,"" he said. ""Bring me anyone who will actually show - not on paper, not in words, not on a slide - but day after day, week after week, month after month, that they can actually prevent a recurrence of what happened there before,"" he said, referring to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel. ""We're open to consider it, but I don't see that happening right now."" The Philadelphi corridor, along the southern edge of the Gaza Strip bordering Egypt, has been one of the main obstacles to a deal to halt the fighting in Gaza and bring Israeli hostages home in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Netanyahu has insisted on retaining control of the corridor, where Israeli troops have uncovered dozens of tunnels that officials say have been used to supply Hamas with weapons and ammunition. The prime minister has faced heavy criticism from many in Israel for holding out on the issue, including from many in his own security establishment who believe Israeli troops can make targeted interventions if needed to prevent any smuggling. The families of many hostages, including some of the six whose bodies were recovered from a tunnel in southern Gaza on Sunday, have accused him of sacrificing their loved ones by insisting on keeping troops in the corridor. But he said maintaining pressure on Hamas was the best way to return the 101 hostages still remaining in Gaza. ""You need to squeeze them, to put pressure on them to release the remaining hostages. So if you want to release the hostages, you've got to control the Philadelphi corridor,"" he said.

68,Biden close to blocking Nippon Steel deal to buy US Steel: Report,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/biden-close-to-blocking-nippon-steel-deal-to-buy-us-steel-report-12814709.html,World,2024-09-05 06:56:00+05:30,"The White House is close to announcing President Joe Biden will block Nippon Steel's acquisition of US Steel, opens new tab citing national security concerns, two sources familiar with the situation said on Wednesday, amid growing bipartisan political opposition to the $14.9 billion deal. US Steel had earlier warned on Wednesday that a failure to conclude a deal with Japan-based Nippon would put thousands of US union jobs at risk and signaled that it would close some steel mills and potentially move its headquarters out of the politically important state of Pennsylvania. A decision could be announced as soon as later this week, sources told Reuters. The move could potentially impact the United States' relationship with Japan, a close ally. The Washington Post first reported the plan. Shares of US Steel closed down 17.5%. Nippon Steel shares fell 1.6% early on Thursday in Tokyo but later recovered to trade 0.3% up. Both Nippon Steel and US Steel said they did not receive any updates from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) regarding the deal, adding they did not believe the acquisition posed national security risks. ""Japan is one of our most staunch allies,"" US Steel said in a statement. ""We fully expect to pursue all possible options under the law to ensure this transaction... closes."" ""Nippon Steel strongly believes that the US government should appropriately handle procedures on this matter in accordance with the law,"" the Japanese company said in a separate statement. Nippon's planned acquisition of the US steelmaker faces opposition from Democrats and Republicans, with Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris saying on Monday she wants US Steel to remain ""American owned and operated."" Her Republican rival Donald Trump has pledged to block the deal if elected. Pennsylvania is a crucial battleground state that could sway the outcome of the 2024 presidential election and both candidates are making repeated visits there. The panel that is reviewing the proposed merger for national security reasons has not sent its formal recommendation to the president, the White House said. White House spokesman John Kirby declined to comment on Biden's plans, but reiterated the president's view ""that American steel companies ought to be American owned."" The Treasury Department, which is overseeing the national security approval process for the deal, declined to comment. US Steel employees rallied on Wednesday outside the company's headquarters seeking to convince politicians to reconsider their opposition to the proposed transaction. ""We want elected leaders and other key decision makers to recognize the benefits of the deal as well as the unavoidable consequences if the deal fails,"" US Steel CEO David Burritt said in a statement. He said that without the deal, ""US Steel will largely pivot away from its blast furnace facilities, putting thousands of good-paying union jobs at risk (and) negatively impacting numerous communities across the locations where its facilities exist."" Burritt added that the failure of the deal would raise ""serious questions about US Steel remaining headquartered in Pittsburgh."" He told the Wall Street Journal it would likely move its headquarters to the south if the deal collapsed. The United Steelworkers union criticized Burritt, accusing him of ""making baseless and unlawful threats."" ""Todayâ€™s pathetic attempt to orchestrate a rally in downtown Pittsburgh shows that US Steel is becoming increasingly desperate to save the deal,"" the union said. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the US Steel comments. The Harris campaign declined to comment as well. Nippon Steel said last week that it plans to invest over $2.7 billion in union-represented facilities at Mon Valley Works in Pennsylvania and Gary Works in Indiana in support of the future of manufacturing for those communities. US Steel said that if the deal does not get approved it ""would not make the same financial commitments."" The steelmaker has cut jobs in recent years including in Michigan. Nippon said earlier on Wednesday that the core senior management as well as a majority of board members at the US company would be US citizens if the deal goes ahead. Nippon's planned $14.9 billion acquisition has received all regulatory approvals from outside the United States and a green light from US Steel's shareholders. It is now under regulatory review in the United States.

69,Big blow to Canadian PM Trudeau as main ally Jagmeet Singh unexpectedly pulls support,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/canadian-pm-trudeau-weakened-after-main-ally-unexpectedly-pulls-support-12814707.html,World,2024-09-05 13:10:00+05:30,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau suffered an unexpected blow on Wednesday when the small party helping keep his minority Liberal government in power withdrew its automatic support, forcing him to attempt new alliances to govern. Promising to continue governing and pushing through social programs, Trudeau dismissed talk of early elections after the left-leaning New Democratic Party's leader Jagmeet Singh said he was ""ripping up"" a deal struck between the two men in 2022. But the move leaves Trudeau reliant on support from other opposition lawmakers to survive confidence votes in the lower chamber of parliament at a time when polls show he will lose badly if an election were held now. An election must be held by the end of October 2025 under Canadian law. ""An election will come in the coming year, hopefully not until next fall, because in the meantime, we're going to deliver for Canadians,"" Trudeau told reporters at a school where he had arrived to talk about expanding lunch programs. ""I really hope the NDP stays focused on how we can deliver for Canadians, as we have over the past years, rather than focusing on politics."" Trudeau, 52, first took office in November 2015 but has over the last two years struggled to fend off attacks from the opposition center-right Conservatives, who blame him for high inflation and a housing crisis. With the NDP's support, his government has pushed through social programs designed to address the cost of living. But the NDP's Singh had expressed growing frustration with Trudeau in recent months, especially over what he said was the Liberals' failure to deal with high prices at grocery stores. ""Justin Trudeau has proven again and again he will always cave to corporate greed,"" Singh said in a video posted on social media where he also declared that he would run for prime minister in the next election. ""Liberals have led people down â€“ they don't deserve another chance."" ESTABLISHING INDEPENDENCE Polls indicate the same voter fatigue plaguing Trudeau has also spread to the NDP, which despite successfully pushing the Liberals to introduce measures such as a national dental program is languishing far behind in third place. Under the 2022 deal, the NDP agreed to keep Trudeau in power until mid-2025 in return for more social spending. Fred Cutler, an associate professor at the University of British Columbia, said the party needed to reestablish its full independence well before the election. ""At least some voters will say, 'Oh, yeah â€¦ the NDP are not just in the Liberals' back pocket, they're competing against the Liberals in the election,'"" Cutler said. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre reiterated his call for an early election to break up what he called a Liberal-NDP coalition driving up prices for Canadians. The House of Commons resumes work on Sept. 16, after which the Conservatives will have the ability to propose a vote of confidence. Trudeau's Liberals could still survive if the NDP abstained on such a vote. A statement from the NDP said the party would decide on an issue-by-issue basis whether to support the Liberals on confidence votes, suggesting it may continue to prop up Trudeau if his fate hung in the balance. A key moment for Trudeau's government will be its budget update later this year, which, if voted down by legislators would trigger a new election.

The shooting was the first of the new school year in the US, a stark reminder of the threat of gun violence in schools and colleges across the nation. The shooting left four dead at Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia, and nine people were taken to hospitals with various injuries from gunshots, investigators said at a press conference. The suspect, identified as Colt Gray, 14, a student at the school, was in custody and will be charged and tried as an adult, said Chris Hosey, director of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.The suspect was speaking with investigators, but they declined to say if they knew what motivated him. They also did not say what type of gun was used in the shooting. ""What we see behind us is an evil thing today,"" Sheriff Jud Smith said during a brief news conference on school grounds. Smith said that his deputies quickly responded to the shooting after the sheriff's department got word of an active shooter around 10:20 a.m. The gunman was confronted by a deputy in the school and the boy immediately got on the ground and surrendered, Smith said. The incident which took place at the school about 50 miles (80 km) northeast of Atlanta. Local TV stations broadcast images of parents lining up in cars on a road outside the school, hoping to be reunited with their children. The school, which had an enrollment of nearly 1,900 last year, began classes on August 1. ABC News quoted a witness, student Sergio Caldera, as saying he was in chemistry class when he heard gunshots. Caldera, 17, told ABC his teacher opened the door and another teacher ran in to tell her to shut the door ""because there's an active shooter."" As students and teachers huddled in the classroom, someone pounded on the door and shouted several times for it to be opened. When the knocking stopped, Caldera heard more gunshots and screams. He said his class later evacuated to the school's football field. BIDEN CALLS FOR GUN SAFETY LEGISLATION The White House said in a statement that President Joe Biden had been briefed on the shooting ""and his administration will continue coordinating with federal, state, and local officials as we receive more information."" ""Jill and I are mourning the deaths of those whose lives were cut short due to more senseless gun violence and thinking of all of the survivors whose lives are forever changed,"" Biden said in a statement, calling on Republicans to work with Democrats to pass ""common-sense gun safety legislation."" Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party nominee for president, called the shooting a ""senseless tragedy."" ""We've gotta stop it. We have to end this epidemic of gun violence,"" Harris said at the start of a campaign event in New Hampshire. Former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, wrote on social media that ""Our hearts are with the victims and loved ones of those affected by the tragic event in Winder, GA. These cherished children were taken from us far too soon by a sick and deranged monster."" The shooting was the first ""planned attack"" at a school this fall, said David Riedman, who runs the K-12 School Shooting Database. Apalachee students returned to school last month; many other students in the US are returning this week. The US has seen hundreds of shootings inside schools and colleges in the past two decades, with the deadliest resulting in over 30 deaths at Virginia Tech in 2007. The carnage has intensified the pitched debate over gun laws and the US Constitution's Second Amendment, which enshrines the right ""to keep and bear arms.""

71,Russia's nuclear-powered missile: Bold ambition or dangerous gamble?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/russias-nuclear-powered-missile-bold-ambition-or-dangerous-gamble-12814649.html,World,2024-09-04 22:54:00+05:30,"Russiaâ€™s experimental nuclear-powered missile, the Burevestnikâ€”also known as the SSC-X-9 Skyfall by NATOâ€”has once again caught the worldâ€™s attention, raising serious questions about its purpose and the risks it might bring. Recently, satellite images have shown that Russia is building launch facilities near a nuclear warhead storage site in Vologda, about 295 miles north of Moscow. After a report by Reuters, experts are speculating that Russia might be getting ready to deploy this missile, despite its rocky history of failed tests and the potential dangers it carries. First unveiled by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2018, the Burevestnik was presented as part of a new wave of â€śinvincibleâ€ť weapons, designed to dodge US missile defenses and strike anywhere on the planet. The missileâ€™s unique propulsion system, which uses a miniature nuclear reactor, theoretically gives it the ability to fly for incredibly long distances, staying under the radar. But with its many technical challenges and safety issues, many experts are questioning if itâ€™s really as powerful as Russia claims. Jeffrey Lewis, a missile expert at the Middlebury Institute, who reviewed the satellite images, commented, ""This imagery suggests something very unique, very different. It aligns with Russiaâ€™s development of this nuclear-powered missile."" He pointed out the unusual features of the site and its proximity to nuclear storage bunkers as signs that something significant might be underway. Strategic and Security Implications The Burevestnik is certainly a bold leap in missile technology, but its potential deployment could make an already tense global security situation even more volatile. Its ability to slip past current missile defense systems is a worrying thought for many in the West, though some argue the practical benefits of such a weapon are still unclear. If Russia does go ahead with deploying this missile, it could reignite the nuclear arms race, especially with key US-Russia arms control agreements like New START edging closer to expiration. But the missile isnâ€™t just a threat to other countries; it could also pose significant risks to Russia itself. The unproven reliability of the Burevestnik, combined with the dangers of its nuclear propulsion system, means thereâ€™s a real risk of radiation leaks, which could be catastrophic. Another issue is the missileâ€™s subsonic speed. While it can theoretically fly for long distances undetected, its slower speed makes it more vulnerable to being intercepted by enemy defenses. This flaw could undercut its supposed stealth advantages and raise questions about its overall effectiveness. The Technology Behind It The Burevestnik is built around an old idea that dates back to the early days of nuclear power: a missile that could keep flying indefinitely, powered by a nuclear reactor. Unlike conventional missiles that run on limited fuel, the Burevestnikâ€™s nuclear reactor could, in theory, keep it in the air for days, even allowing it to circle the globe. After being launched by solid-fuel boosters, the missileâ€™s nuclear reactor would kick in to sustain its flight. It could fly at low altitudes, avoiding radar detection, and potentially reach targets anywhere in the world, far outstripping the range of existing intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). However, thereâ€™s a catch: the missileâ€™s subsonic speedâ€”an inherent limitation of its nuclear propulsionâ€”makes it slower than other missiles. This gives enemy defenses more time to detect and shoot it down, which could make it less effective in a real-world scenario. A Troubled Track Record Russia has been testing the Burevestnik since at least 2017, but the results havenâ€™t been great. Out of at least 13 known tests, most have ended in failure, with only two being reported as partial successes. In 2019, one test ended in disaster when the missile crashed into the White Sea, causing a massive explosion that killed several Russian scientists. This tragic incident highlighted the dangers of the missileâ€™s nuclear engine, leading many to wonder if the risks really outweigh the potential rewards. Global Reactions and Concerns The news that Russia might be getting closer to deploying the Burevestnik has caught the attention of the US and NATO, especially after satellite images revealed construction activity near the Vologda-20 nuclear warhead storage facility. This site, located about 400 miles from Russiaâ€™s borders with Finland and Estonia, seems to be designed for large, fixed missile systems, according to experts. This development suggests that Russia could be planning to station Burevestnik missiles there, making them ready to launch at a momentâ€™s notice. Experts are divided on what this could mean for global security. Some believe the Burevestnikâ€™s ability to evade missile defenses and fly long distances gives Russia a unique advantage, particularly in a second-strike scenario. Others, however, are less convinced. One of the biggest worries is the missileâ€™s nuclear propulsion system. If something goes wrong, the missile could spew radioactive material along its flight path or in the event of a malfunction. Compared to other missile systems in Russiaâ€™s arsenal, like the Sarmat ICBM, the Burevestnikâ€™s advantages seem limited. The Sarmat, for instance, has a range of over 11,000 miles (17,700 kilometers) and can deliver multiple warheads at hypersonic speeds, making it much harder to intercept than the slower Burevestnik. What Experts Are Saying Not everyone is impressed by Russiaâ€™s latest missile. Thomas Countryman, a former US State Department official, didnâ€™t mince words when he called the Burevestnik ""a uniquely stupid weapon system, a flying Chernobyl that poses more threat to Russia than to other countries."" Hans Kristensen from the Federation of American Scientists echoed this sentiment, saying, ""The missile will be as vulnerable as any cruise missile."" Analyst Jeffery Lewis added, ""The siteâ€™s design suggests theyâ€™re preparing for something very unique,"" Reuters reported. Decker Eveleth, the analyst who first identified the construction site, believes itâ€™s clearly meant for the Burevestnik. According to Reuters, Eveleth noted the nine horizontal launch pads protected by berms, designed to shield against explosions or attacks, as a strong indicator that Russia is serious about deploying this missile. Looking Ahead As Russia edges closer to possibly deploying the Burevestnik, the world is left wondering what this will mean for global security. While the missile could be seen as a symbol of Russiaâ€™s determination to maintain its status as a nuclear superpower, its actual usefulness might be limited by its technical flaws and safety concerns. The missileâ€™s troubled history of tests doesnâ€™t inspire much confidence that it will live up to the high expectations set by Putin when he first announced it in 2018. However, the Burevestnikâ€™s development could still have significant implications for the global arms race, especially as the US and Russiaâ€™s New START treaty is set to expire in 2026. Some experts believe the missile could become a bargaining chip in future arms control talks. As tensions between Russia and the West continue to riseâ€”especially in light of the ongoing conflict in Ukraineâ€”the deployment of the Burevestnik could add yet another layer of complexity to an already precarious geopolitical situation. However, as Decker Eveleth from the CNA research group pointed out in a report in Foreign Policy, ""the Burevestnik is not a wonder weapon, and the challenges it poses for NATO security are neither new nor unmanageable.""

Musk's political stance has shifted significantly. Once a supporter of Joe Biden and his climate agenda, Musk has since aligned himself with Trump and the Republican camp. His support for Trump contrasts sharply with his previous endorsements of Hillary Clinton and his work with the Obama administration. The feud between Musk and the Democratic administration began when Biden's team rejected Muskâ€™s proposal for a carbon tax, a cause Musk has championed since 2015. Tensions escalated in 2021 when Tesla was not included in a White House EV summit, which Musk found ""odd."" He has also criticized Biden's immigration policies and alleged that a second Biden term could undermine American democracy. Musk has expressed interest in collaborating with Trump on auditing US agencies if Trump is re-elected, though such a role could raise concerns about conflicts of interest given Muskâ€™s business interests. With the US presidential election approaching in November, the race between Trump and Harris remains highly competitive.

The Labor Department reported Wednesday that there were 7.7 million open jobs in July, down from 7.9 million in June. The pace of hiring picked up, though, from June to July. Wednesday's figures indicate that fewer companies are seeking to add workers despite recent data showing that consumer spending is still growing. Last week, the government estimated that the economy expanded at a healthy 3% annual rate in the April-June quarter. The number of job openings has been trending gradually down over the past year. Yet there are still roughly 1.1 job openings for every unemployed person, Wednesdayâ€™s report showed. That reflects the economy's continuing need for workers and marks a reversal from before the pandemic, when there were always more unemployed people than available jobs. The July report on job openings is the first of several measures this week of the labor market's health that the Federal Reserve will be watching closely. If clear evidence emerges that hiring is faltering, the Fed might decide at its next meeting Sept. 17-18 to start cutting its benchmark interest rate by a relatively aggressive half-percentage point. If hiring remains mostly solid, however, a more typical quarter-point rate cut would be likelier.

Yuri Ushakov, President Vladimir Putin's foreign affairs aide, told reporters that Turkey has submitted an application â€śfor full membershipâ€ť in the bloc that Russia this year chairs, and it will be considered. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has stated several times that his country aspires to become a member of the BRICS alliance, according to Omer Celik, a spokesman for Erdogan's ruling party. But Celik stopped short this week of confirming that Turkey has applied formally. The BRICS alliance was founded in 2006 by Brazil, Russia, India and China, with South Africa joining in 2010. It recently has undergone an expansion, and now includes Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia has said itâ€™s considering joining, and Azerbaijan and Malaysia have formally applied. BRICS has a stated aim to amplify the voice of major emerging economies to counterbalance the Western-led global order. Its founding members have called for a fairer world order and the reform of international institutions like the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Erdogan, who has been in power for more than two decades, has sought to carve a more independent foreign policy for Turkey and to enhance its global influence. The country is also frustrated by the lack of progress in its membership talks with the European Union. Last week, Erdogan said Turkey should â€śsimultaneouslyâ€ť develop relations with both the East and the West. Turkey, which straddles Europe and Asia, joined the NATO military alliance in 1952. It began talks to join the European Union in 2005 but the negotiations have stalled due to concerns over democratic regression under Erdoganâ€™s administration, and ongoing disputes with Cyprus, an EU member, among other challenges. BRICS is expected to discuss taking in new members in a meeting in Russia next month. Putin earlier this year welcomed Turkey's interest in the bloc and promised that Moscow â€świll support this aspiration and desire to be together with the countries of this alliance, to be together, closer, to solve common problems.â€ť On Monday, Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also said Turkey expressed interest in joining BRICS.

The United States is Taiwan's most important supporter and arms supplier, despite its lack of formal ties with the island, and Raymond Greene, the newly appointed director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and de facto U.S. ambassador, was speaking to reporters in Taipei. ""The United States is building a latticework of alliances in the Indo-Pacific to enhance our deterrence capabilities,"" Greene said, adding Taiwan was not the only target of Chinese efforts to ""use intimidation and coercion to change the status quo"" and that as a result more and more countries were joining forces to preserve the rules-based international system. He said those efforts, along with Taiwan's investment in defence and ""impressive"" military reforms, were designed to prevent a war rather than preparing for one. ""Preserving strategic balance in the Taiwan Strait and the broader Indo-Pacific region will promote peaceful dialogue to resolve disputes between the two sides,"" said Greene, who delivered his remarks in Mandarin. China has stepped up military and political pressure to force democratically governed Taiwan to accept its sovereignty claims in recent years, and in May held war games around the island following the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te, a man Beijing calls a ""separatist"". JOINT PRODUCTION OF WEAPONS? Greene also said the United States would not rule out the possibility of jointly producing weapons with Taiwan, adding that the island's defence needs were the top priority for U.S. arms deliveries. ""The U.S. is now working with a number of partners looking at possibilities of expanding our joint production of military supplies, and I'll not rule out Taiwan being one of those partners in the future,"" Greene said, without giving details. China has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control, while Taiwan's government has vowed to defend itself, rejecting Chinese sovereignty claims. Greene took up his role in July. He was previously the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. embassy in Tokyo. He said the United States was also working with Taiwan to boost its response in dealing with emergencies, which is another top priority for Lai's government, including reinforcing the island's resilience in communications, cyber security and energy supplies. ""We are looking forward to helping Taiwan apply its own expertise in dealing with (problems ranging from) natural disasters to countering potential man-made threats.""

The attack is the latest in Africa's longest struggle with militancy. More than 50 extremists on motorcycles entered the Tarmuwa council area of Yobe state on Sunday evening, firing weapons and setting buildings ablaze, according to Yobe police spokesperson Dungus Abdulkarim. Police attributed the attack to Boko Haram, which has been insurgent in the region since 2009, seeking to impose its radical interpretation of Islamic law. The group's actions have caused at least 35,000 deaths, displaced over 2 million, and led to a severe humanitarian crisis. So far this year, armed groups have killed at least 1,500 people in the region, according to the U.S.-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED). Yobe Deputy Governor Idi Barde Gubana reported a lower death toll of 34 from SundayŌĆÖs attack. However, community leader Zanna Umar said 102 villagers have been confirmed dead, with many bodies buried before officials arrived or taken elsewhere. ŌĆ£We are still working to search for more because many people are still missing,ŌĆØ Umar said. SundayŌĆÖs attack is among the deadliest in Yobe this year, a state less frequently targeted than neighboring Borno, the epicentre of the Boko Haram conflict. Local media reported that the extremists claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was in reprisal for villagers informing security operatives about their activities. A number of Boko Haram members were killed as a result of the information passed on by villagers, the militants were quoted as saying. Reprisals are rampant in the northeast and villagers sometimes ŌĆ£pay the priceŌĆØ after military operations, said Confidence MacHarry with SBM Intelligence, a Lagos-based security firm. ŌĆ£This is the first time our community has faced such a devastating attack,ŌĆØ said Buba Adamu, a local chief, his voice mixed with grief and fear. ŌĆ£We never imagined something like this could happen here,"" AP quoted local media. ŌĆ£There are some places (in the region) totally out of the control of the Nigerian Army and villagers often live in fear of reprisals,ŌĆØ MacHarry said. In such places, he added, Nigerian security forces only go there for operations but do not have enough manpower to remain on the ground. Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who was elected last year on a pledge to end the conflict with Boko Haram, condemned the attack in a statement that tried to assure villagers of justice but was silent about security measures. Security analysts have faulted TinubuŌĆÖs security policies, saying he has not taken any bold steps so far to resolve the killings and that the problems he inherited, such as inadequate resources and manpower, remain.

The military has lost swaths of territory near the border with China in northern Shan state to an alliance of armed ethnic minority groups and ""People's Defence Forces"" battling to overturn its 2021 coup. The groups have seized a regional military command and taken control of lucrative border trade crossings, prompting rare public criticism by military supporters of the junta's top leadership. Junta troops ""will... launch counterattacks"", junta chief Min Aung Hlaing said on Tuesday in the Shan state capital Taunggyi, according to the Global New Light of Myanmar. He accused the alliance of using ""administrative buildings and innocent civilians as human shields"", according to the newspaper. ""Therefore, the people residing in towns and villages where the terrorists unlawfully occupied should be aware of security so as not to face exploitation."" The junta is battling widespread armed opposition and its soldiers are accused of bloody rampages and using air and artillery strikes to punish civilian communities. It announced this week that the three main ethnic minority armed groups battling the military in Shan state had been officially declared ""terrorist"" organisations. The declaration will not affect the fighting against the Arakan Army (AA), Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) and the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), however those found supporting or contacting them can now face legal action. The alliance and PDF groups have battled closer to the second city of Mandalay, home to around 1.5 million people and the military's central command. Opponents of the military launched a rocket attack on Mandalay on Tuesday, damaging buildings and wounding one person, local media reported, in a rare attack on an urban area. An opinion piece in Wednesday's Global New Light of Myanmar criticised the military's recent losses in Shan state. ""Who would have thought that Lashio would fall,"" it said, referring to a Shan town of 150,000 people that was captured last month. ""Who would then give the definite assurance that nothing will happen to whatever you own in Mandalay?"" ""Once the artillery shells started to rain down upon the city, it would be too late to move out of the city in an orderly manner,"" it said.

79,Trump vs Harris: Tax cuts or higher taxes to revitalise the US economy?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/trump-vs-harris-tax-cuts-or-higher-taxes-to-revitalise-the-us-economy-12814445.html,World,2024-09-04 16:46:00+05:30,"Donald Trump is betting that Americans crave trillions of dollars in tax cuts â€” and that growth will be so fantastic that it's not worth worrying about budget deficits. In short, he's hoping that most economic analyses of his ideas are dead wrong. Vice President Kamala Harris believes that big corporations and the ultra-wealthy should pay more in taxes â€” and wants to use those revenues to help spur the construction of 3 million homes and offer tax breaks for parents. She's hoping to deliver on the types of policies that President Joe Biden has been unable to secure in a lasting way. The two presidential nominees are using the week before their debate to sharpen their economic messages about who could do more for the middle class. Harris will discuss her policy plans Wednesday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, while Trump will address the Economic Club of New York on Thursday. The economy has historically been a dominant issue in presidential elections. In an August survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs, Trump did narrowly better on the economy with 45% saying he would handle it better and 38% saying Harris would. There are high stakes in this showdown because the winner of November's election could rewrite much of the federal tax code next year, when parts of Trump's 2017 tax cuts are set to expire. A look at the candidates' proposals: Trump and Harris have different ways of trying to help the middle class. The former Republican president sees tax cuts for businesses and the wealthy as essential for promoting more investment, with those who've previously advised him saying average growth would top 3%. Mind you, overall economic growth never hit 3% a year when Trump was president. But between 2018 and 2019, the median household income jumped by $5,220 to an inflation-adjusted $78,250, according to the Census Bureau. â€śWhat I tell people all the time: The Trump policies were designed to lift middle-class wages, re-onshore and re-industrialize,â€ť said Joseph LaVorgna, an economist who worked in the Trump White House. â€śThe intention is to get wages higher.â€ť By contrast, Harris wants to upgrade the middle-class promise of home ownership and ease the high costs of parenthood. She also wants tax breaks for entrepreneurs. It's a message meant to show that Harris can address the problem of prices as people are still recovering from inflation spiking to a four-decade high in 2022. First-time homebuyers could get $25,000 in down payment assistance that would be coupled with broader policies to encourage the construction of 3 million additional homes in four years. New parents could get a $6,000 tax credit and an expanded child tax credit. â€śWhen working- and middle-class Americans have the opportunity to earn more, to build a business, to buy a home, to climb the economic ladder, it strengthens our economy and helps us grow,"" said Brian Nelson, a Harris adviser. Trump has proposed no taxes on tips paid to workers or Social Security income. Harris has embraced the idea of not taxing workers' tips. As Ernie Tedeschi at the Yale Budget Lab noted, excluding tips from taxes is unlikely to provide much of an economic boost even if some individuals feel better off. He noted that just 2.5% of workers receive tips and that many don't earn enough money to owe income taxes to the federal government. Trump would also exclude Social Security payments from taxation, which could cost $1.2 trillion over 10 years. The risk is those taxes help fund Social Security. Without those revenues, the program would be unable to pay full benefits starting in 2033, or two years earlier than currently forecast, according to an analysis by Brendan Duke, senior director of economic policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. As much as Trump talks about tax cuts, he would also want to engage in a massive tax hike by charging higher tariffs on imports in order to grow jobs. How much would the tariff be? No one really knows. Trump has proposed a broad tariff of 10%, but at an August event in North Carolina suggested it could be as high as 20%. Against Chinese products, he would like a tax of somewhere between 60% to 100%. The Republican insists his tariffs wouldn't jack up inflation, but the whole goal of the tax is to make imports more expensive so that more manufacturing occurs domestically. The Harris campaign says the middle class would face a higher tax burden, with the 20% tariff applied broadly costing a typical household $4,000 annually. The Trump campaign did not answer questions about how the tariffs would work. If the goal is to bring jobs back from overseas, the tariffs would presumably be phased in over time so that manufacturing jobs could return to the U.S. But if the goal is to raise revenues, then they would be implemented immediately. It's not clear that Trump could pay for his ambitious tax cuts. He wants to extend the expiring provisions of his 2017 tax overhaul. Heâ€™s floated the idea of chopping the 21% corporate tax rate to 15%, in addition to no taxes on tips and Social Security income. The estimated price is close to $6 trillion, but it could be higher. And the Congressional Budget Office already estimates $22 trillion in deficits over the next decade without the tax overhaul being extended. Growth would not appear to cover the price tag. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget surveyed economic analyses and found that Trump extending his tax cuts would have roughly no impact on overall growth over 10 years because of the additional debt. â€śThe overall agenda doesnâ€™t seem to be all that pro-growth,â€ť said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. According to the Harris campaign, all her spending plans would be funded. Officials with her campaign have suggested that her sources of revenue would largely mirror Biden's 2025 budget proposal. Still, the Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates that her policies would add $2.3 trillion in spending. It forecasts that her plan to increase the corporate tax rate to 28% would produce $1.1 trillion in tax revenues. But the group did not include other proposals such as taxing the unrealized income gains of people worth $100 million or more, as there are not enough details to produce an accurate number. Nor did it include other revenue increases. The Penn Wharton Budget Model suggests that the Harris plans would hurt growth more than Trump's would through 2034, though it excluded his proposed tariffs from the analysis. The real difference of the plan is how tax burdens would change starting in 2026. Under Trump's plans, someone in the top 0.1% of earners would after taxes get on average $376,910 more in income. The poorest 20% would get just $320 more. Harris' policies would reduce the average incomes of the top 0.1% by $167,225. But the bottom 20% get $2,355 more in income and benefits. â€śBigger picture: both Harris and Trump are causing the debt path to rise even faster than the fast pace under current law,â€ť said Kent Smetters, the faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model.

Detailed cautions to students were released by China's ministry of state security on Wednesday on its public WeChat social media account. The alert is meant for those who could be manipulated in a number of ways to give up information. It said state security departments have found that personnel of foreign espionage and intelligence organs have carried out targeted wooing and infiltration of young students. ""They take advantage of the characteristics of young students' strong curiosity and willingness to try new things,"" a statement said. China has been cracking down on perceived threats to its national security, releasing several warnings this year to its citizens and revealing cases of spying that it has uncovered. Workers for foreign intelligence agencies specifically target college students with access to classified and sensitive scientific research data, disguising themselves as university scholars, and employees of scientific research institutions and consulting companies, the agency said. They lure young students ""with high-paying part-time opportunities in the name of market research, academic exchanges,"" it added. After students express interest, the agency said foreign intelligence agencies will provide so-called free training and guidance through social media, telephone, or video conferencing. They even put on the ""disguise of handsome guys and beautiful women who are intimate and considerate, dragging young students into the trap of love with false feelings."" The agency did not provide specific details of any foreign firms who have targeted students. It could not be immediately reached for comment. (With agency inputs)

The case has horrified the nation, with harrowing details emerging in court that led to the victim's daughter leaving the room, overwhelmed by emotion. The case against 71-year-old Dominique P. has shocked France after the disturbing allegations came to light by chance when he was caught filming up women's skirts in a local supermarket. The trial, taking place in the southern city of Avignon and set to conclude in December, involves charges of rape and sexual abuse against him and 50 other men, aged 26 to 74, whom he allegedly recruited online to abuse his wife. On Tuesday, when asked if he was guilty of the accusations, Dominique P. responded with a simple ""yes."" The ongoing trial will determine his sentencing, along with the verdicts for the other men involved in the abuse. His wife, 72-year-old Gisele P., is attending the trial alongside their daughter and two sons. She requested the trial be open to the public. Her lawyers assert that she was so heavily sedated during the period from 2011 to 2020 that she was unaware of the abuse. Presiding judge Roger Arata, leading a panel of five judges, coldly read out the main findings of the investigation on the trial's second day. 'And I stopped calling you dad' Their daughter, who uses the pen name Caroline Darian, left the room in tears less than 20 minutes after the start of the hearing. Arata recounted how naked photomontages of her had been found on Dominique P.'s computer in a folder titled ""Around my daughter, naked"". Darian collapsed in tears. Darian left the room trembling, escorted by her two brothers and her lawyer Antoine Camus, but reappeared some twenty minutes later. For their children, ""it's immensely painful, unbearable"", the lawyer said afterwards. ""Even if they are not discovering anything new as they know the case, it was particularly gruelling this morning."" Gisele P., wearing a white blouse, remained calm and reserved throughout the proceedings. At the other end of the courtroom, but directly opposite her, sat her husband, dressed in a grey T-shirt and appearing emotionless. She has commenced divorce proceedings. As their daughter Darian returned to the courtroom, she paused in front of the dock reserved for 18 of the accused who are in custody, including her father, but none looked her in the eye. Some have already been sentenced for domestic violence or rape. Darian in 2022 wrote a book ""Et j'ai cesse de t'appeler papa"" (""And I stopped calling you dad"") about the effect of the discovery of the crimes on the family. Camus said he hoped the trial would raise awareness about abuse using so-called date rape drugs within families. According to France's drug security authority, 42 percent of credible reports of date rape drug use in 2021 occurred in the private sphere. Just 19 percent of cases had been reported as happening in a party context. Online forum From time to time, Dominique P. glanced at some of the 32 other defendants attending the trial as free men in another part of the courtroom. A 51th man is being judged in absentia. Besides the husband, there are 72 suspects in the case but only 50 have been identified and tracked down. Most of them face up to 20 years in jail for aggravated rape if convicted. Several have been accused of abuse on six different occasions. During searches investigators came across thousands of photos and videos showing Gisele P. being sexually abused by strangers recruited online on a forum called ""Without her knowledge"" on the controversial website coco.gg, shut down by the courts since last June. Dominique P., who appeared on the site under a pseudonym, has claimed he only ""occasionally"" logged on. But several discussions were found in which he sometimes used the term ""rape"" and told potential attackers that administering sleeping pills to his wife allowed him to abuse her by engaging practices she would normally refuse. Police said they found hundreds of pictures and videos of his wife on Dominique P.'s computer, visibly unconscious and mostly in the foetal position. The images are alleged to show dozens of rapes in the couple's home in Mazan, a village of 6,000 people around 33 kilometres (20 miles) from Avignon in the Provence region.(Inputs From AFP)

The choice of Chase has not been previously reported. He is more senior than the U.S. officer who attended the Xiangshan Forum last year, a sign that the U.S. military is hoping for deeper working-level engagement with China amid regional disputes and increased deployments across East Asia. More than 90 countries and international organisations plan to send delegations to the Sept. 12-14 forum in Beijing, Chinese state media reported Wednesday. Chase's attendance is in line with historical norms, the U.S. official added, since then-U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for China Chad Sbragia attended the forum in 2019.

Washington sent Xanthi Carras, China country director in the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense, when the forum resumed last year after a three-year hiatus due to the pandemic. It was a sign of thawing military ties; however Carras' title is of a lower rank than Chase or Sbragia.

U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said no new agreements had been reached on the South China Sea during a visit to China last week. China has repeatedly criticised U.S. deployments in the Asia-Pacific region, including the placement of long-range missiles in the Philippines, as well as U.S. arms sales to democratically governed Taiwan, which China considers its own territory, over the strenuous objections of Taipei. Meanwhile the U.S. has raised concerns over China's ""aggressive"" actions in the South China Sea, its frequent military manoeuvres in the air and waters surrounding Taiwan, and what it says is the opacity of China's nuclear buildup. Official nuclear talks were halted by Beijing in July in protest over U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. But both sides have agreed that U.S. Indo-Pacific Command leaders would soon speak by phone to their counterparts in China's southern theatre command, which covers its southern seas.

87,US unveils charges against Hamas leaders over October 7 attack on Israel,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/us-unveils-charges-against-hamas-leaders-over-october-7-attack-on-israel-12814144.html,World,2024-09-04 11:53:00+05:30,"The United States unsealed a raft of ""terrorism"" and other charges against six Hamas leaders on Tuesday related to the armed Palestinian group's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. The charging document, dated February 1, targets six leaders of the group -- including Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar and late political leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in late July in Tehran. They are accused of ""conspiracy to provide material support for acts of terrorism resulting in death"" along with six other counts. The charges were filed under seal ""to position the United States to be ready to take into custody"" Haniyeh and the other defendants, a Justice Department official said in a statement. The official cited Haniyeh's death -- which Hamas and Iran say was an Israeli assassination -- and unspecified ""recent developments in the region,"" as reasons for the unsealing. Hamas, which has been designated a ""terrorist organization"" by Washington since 1997, launched its unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, triggering the brutal ongoing war in the Gaza Strip, which is controlled by the Palestinian group. The attacks killed at least 43 American citizens, according to the complaint, and resulted in at least 10 Americans being taken as hostages or missing. ""The charges unsealed today are just one part of our effort to target every aspect of Hamas's operations. These actions will not be our last,"" US Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. Garland said that US authorities were also investigating the killing of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, a 23-year-old Israeli-American taken hostage by Hamas on October 7. His death was announced over the weekend along with five other hostages. ""We are investigating Hersh's murder, and each and every one of Hamas's brutal murders of Americans, as an act of terrorism,"" Garland said. Charged along with Sinwar and Haniyeh was Mohammad Al-Masri, the former commander in chief of the al-Qassam Brigades who is believed to have died in July. Also charged was Marwan Issa, who was the deputy commander of the al-Qassam Brigades from approximately 2007 until his reported death earlier this year. Qatar-based Khaled Meshaal, the head of the group's diaspora office responsible for overseeing Hamas's presence outside of Gaza, was also charged. The final man charged was Ali Baraka, Hamas's head of National Relations, who is also based outside of Gaza. Israeli commanders believe most-wanted Sinwar, 61, is hiding in a labyrinthine maze of tunnels that Hamas has built under the Gaza Strip over the years. The October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people overall, mostly civilians and including and hostages killed in captivity, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. Israel's campaign against Hamas has so far killed at least 40,819 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry. The UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children.

The violence has intensified as fighting between Myanmarâ€™s ruling janta and the Arakan Army, a powerful ethnic militia drawn from the Buddhist majority, continues to worsen. ""We have information that around 8,000 Rohingya crossed into Bangladesh recently, mostly over the last two months,"" said Mohammad Shamsud Douza, a senior official in charge of refugees for the Bangladeshi government. ""Bangladesh is already over-burdened and unable to accommodate any more Rohingya,"" he told Reuters on Wednesday. The Bangladesh government has not previously provided any estimate of how many Rohingya have crossed over in the last few months. The government will hold a ""serious discussion at the cabinetâ€ť within the next two to three days to address the crisis, Bangladeshâ€™s de-facto foreign minister, Mohammad Touhid Hossain, told reporters late on Tuesday. While expressing sympathy for the Rohingya, Hossain said that the country no longer has the capacity to provide humanitarian shelter to additional refugees. ""It is not possible to fully seal the border,â€ť he added, adding that efforts will be made to prevent further infiltration. Tens of thousands of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh held rallies in camps on August 25, marking the seventh anniversary of the 2017 military crackdown that forced them to flee Myanmar, demanding an end to violence and safe return to their homeland. Over one million Rohingya currently live in overcrowded camps in southern Bangladesh, with little hope of returning to Myanmar, where they are largely denied citizenship and other basic rights. The recent surge in violence is the worst the Rohingya have faced since the 2017 Myanmar military-led campaign, which the United Nations described as having genocidal intent. Last month, Hossain told Reuters Bangladesh cannot accept more Rohingya refugees and called on India and other countries to take greater action. He also urged the international community to apply more pressure on the Arakan Army to cease attacks on the Rohingya in Rakhine state.

Citing South Korea's Chosun TV, the report said that the executions reportedly stemmed from the officials' failure to prevent the deaths of over a thousand people during these natural disasters. Heavy rains and landslides recently struck Chagang Province causing numerous deaths, injuries and leaving many people homeless in July. The exact number of deaths remains unconfirmed, but South Korean media suggests the toll could exceed 1,000. According to the Chosun TV report, the North Korean authorities had pledged to take action against those who allegedly did less to prevent the loss of lives during the deadly floods. The executions reportedly took place late last month. Although due to North Korea's extreme secrecy, the details of the report remain difficult to verify. However, the North Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) did report that Kim Jong Un presided over an emergency Politburo meeting in Sinuiju, where he ordered authorities to ""strictly punish"" officials who neglected their disaster prevention duties, leading to what he described as ""unacceptable"" casualties. The floods severely impacted Chagang Province, near the border with China causing widespread devastation.North Korean state media reported that heavy rains flooded over 4,100 houses, submerged 7,410 acres of agricultural land, and damaged numerous public buildings, roads, and railways in Sinuiju and Uiju. Investigations are ongoing into the actions of Kang Bong-hoon, the dismissed Chagang Province Party secretary and former deputy director of the Munitions Industry Department, who was known to have accompanied Kim Jong Un during on-site inspections.

90,India-Singapore Trade Ties: Boosting economic relations amid regional challenges and changing global landscape,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/india-singapore-trade-ties-boosting-economic-relations-amid-regional-challenges-and-changing-global-landscape-12813918.html,World,2024-09-04 08:24:00+05:30,"By Anisree SureshÂ  The 2nd edition of the India-Singapore Ministerial Roundtable (ISMR) was held in Singapore on August 26, focusing on trade and economic cooperation between the two nations, ahead of PM Narendra Modiâ€™s September 4-5 visit. India's delegation of four union ministers was led by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman, who deliberated on six priority pillars for the bilateral partnership in emerging and futuristic areas.Â  While active bilateral political coordination and economic engagement are strengthening at a rapid pace, it is crucial for India to rethink its trade policies and forgo its protectionist measures urgently. This is necessary to integrate better with the broader global value chains and to tap into the economic prospects offered by the Southeast Asian markets. Significance of India-Singapore Ties India's bilateral relations with Singapore are of immense significance to India's policymakers. Singapore, as India's sixth largest trading partner, with a total trade of $35.61 billion, accounts for approximately 29 percent of India's total trade with ASEAN. It is also India's largest source of FDI, with a $ 11.7 billion invested in FY 2023-24, though a significant portion of this due to roundtripping. India's economic reforms in the 1990s, its â€˜Look East Policyâ€™, and later â€˜Act East Policyâ€™ have led to a new framework for cooperation with Southeast Asian countries, including the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) between India and Singapore in 2005. With over 20 active routine bilateral engagements and an India-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in Goods, Singapore plays a crucial role in enhancing India's participation in regional supply chain arrangements in the wider Indo-Pacific region. However, it remains to be seen if they have fully realized their trade potential. Trade Dynamics and Challenges The import concession rates that imports from Singapore enjoy in India fuel the trade relations to some extent. The CECA helped India and Singapore liberalise trade relations by establishing mutual recognition agreements, liberalising visa rules, and launching e-commerce platforms. The rapid growth of Singapore's digital economy and trends in the global demand and supply for tech talent have increased the prospects of Indian talent migration to Singapore. Although trade and connectivity are significantly increasing between both countries, a few concerns continue to impact achieving the fullest potential of the trade prospects. India's trade concerns include inadequate market access for services exports and greater mobility of people to deliver them (professional talent migration).Â  India's continued connectivity dilemma in integrating well with its eastern neighbours continues to hamper the trade prospects.Â  Although trade relations with Singapore are strong, India has not fully captured other Southeast Asian markets. The decision not to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) has further exacerbated this gap. Impact of RCEP and Strategic Opportunities  Though India was party to the initial negotiations, it has decided to abstain from joining the RCEP Agreement to safeguard the interests of the agriculture and dairy sectors. Moreover, India has been experiencing a trade deficit with most RCEP participating countries. Due to its decision to abstain, India had to forgo market access in sectors such as IT and pharmaceuticals, where it enjoys a comparative advantage and risk of trade diversion away from Indian products and services as RCEP members gained preferential access to each other's markets. Despite the individual agreements that India has with many East Asian and South Asian countries, it cannot boost trade in the same way as a multilateral deal with the scope of RCEP, and that continues to impact India's trade prospects with the region, as ASEAN strongly promotes the economic integration with its FTA partners. Future Directions for Economic Integration India must also engage with Singapore to liberalise the service sector and maximise its comparative advantage. Given Singaporeâ€™s role as a hub for trade and finance in the Southeast Asian region, India can leverage this by offering fintech products, IT services, and backend processing. Both countries can also collaborate in the semiconductor ecosystem, combining Indiaâ€™s design skills with Singaporeâ€™s 20 years of ecosystem management experience. By focusing on liberalising the trade in goods and services and providing seamless connectivity, intra-regional trade can be improved. From Indiaâ€™s end, Visa-on-arrival for Singapore citizens and cross-border transit projects will increase the physical connectivity between the two regions. This enhanced physical connectivity would help India to integrate well with its Southeast Asian neighbours. Simultaneously, India could also explore preferential trading agreements with other Southeast Asian economies, such as the Philippines, Vietnam, and Indonesia. India-Singapore trade relations are progressing positively, and with a further push on economic integration, the challenges of not joining the RCEP can be overcome. In a world which is slowly deglobalising, India must take every opportunity to augment trade relations with existing partners.

91,Over 50 dead in Russian missiles strike on Ukrainian military academy and hospital in Poltava,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/russian-missiles-blast-ukrainian-military-academy-and-hospital-killing-more-than-50-officials-say-12813898.html,World,2024-09-04 07:42:00+05:30,"Two ballistic missiles blasted a military academy and nearby hospital Tuesday in Ukraine, killing more than 50 people and wounding more than 200 others, Ukrainian officials said, in one ofÂ the deadliest Russian strikesÂ sinceÂ the warÂ began. The missiles tore into the heart of the Poltava Military Institute of Communicationâ€™s main building, causing several stories to collapse. It didnâ€™t take long for the smell of smoke and word of the deadly strike to spread through the central-eastern town. â€śPeople found themselves under the rubble. Many were saved,â€ť Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video posted on his Telegram channel. He ordered an investigation. Shattered bricks were visible inside the closed gates of the institution, which was off-limits to the media, and small pools of blood could be seen just outside hours later. Field communications trucks were parked along the perimeter. Roads were covered in glass from shattered apartment windows. â€śI heard explosions ... I was at home at that time. When I left the house, I realized that it was something evil and something bad,â€ť said Yevheniy Zemskyy, who arrived to volunteer his help. â€śI was worried about the children, the residents of Poltava. Thatâ€™s why we are here today to help our city in any way we can.â€ť By Tuesday evening, the death toll stood at 51, according to the general prosecutorâ€™s office.Filip Pronin, governor of the region that bears Poltavaâ€™s name, announced on Telegram that 219 people were wounded. Up to 18 people may be buried under the rubble, he said. Ten apartment buildings were damaged, and more than 150 people donated blood, Pronin said. He called it â€śa great tragedyâ€ť for the region and all of Ukraine, and announced three days of mourning starting Wednesday. The academy trains officers in communications and electronics, as well as drone operators, honing some of the most valued skills in a war where both sides are fighting for control of the electronic battlefield.â€śThe enemy certainly must answer for all (its) crimes against humanity,â€ť Pronin wrote on Telegram. The Kremlin offered no immediate comment on the strike. It was not clear whether the dead and wounded were limited to Ukrainian military personnel, such as signal corps cadets, or if they included civilians. Since it embarked on its full-scale invasion in early 2022, the Russian military has repeatedly used missiles to smash civilian targets, sometimesÂ killing scores of peopleÂ in a single attack. Some of the deadliest such assaults includedÂ a 2022 airstrike on a theater in MariupolÂ that killed hundreds of civilians sheltering in the basement and a strike that same year on theÂ train station in KramatorskÂ that killed 61. Apartment buildings, markets and shopping centers have also been targeted. Poltava is about 350 kilometers (200 miles) southeast of Kyiv, on the main highway and rail route between Kyiv and Ukraineâ€™s second-largest city, Kharkiv, which is close to the Russian border. The attack happened as Ukrainian forces sought to carve out their holdings in Russiaâ€™s Kursk border region after a surprise incursion that began Aug. 6 and as the Russian army hacks its wayÂ deeper into eastern Ukraine.The missiles hit shortly after an air-raid alert sounded, when many people were on their way to a bomb shelter, Ukraineâ€™s Defense Ministry said, describing the strike as â€śbarbaric.â€ť Rescue crews and medics saved 25 people, including 11 who were dug out of the rubble, a Defense Ministry statement said. The strike came on the day that Russian PresidentÂ Vladimir Putin visited Mongolia. There was no indication that his hosts would heed demands to arrest him on an international warrant for alleged war crimes. Zelenskyy repeated his appeal for Ukraineâ€™s Western partners to ensure swift delivery of military aid. He has previously chided the U.S. and European countries for being slow to make good on their pledges of help. He also wants them to ease restrictions on what Ukraine can target on Russian soil with the weapons they provide. Some countries fear that hitting Russia could escalate the war. â€śUkraine needs air defense systems and missiles now, not sitting in storage,â€ť Zelenskyy wrote in English on Telegram. â€śLong-range strikes that can protect us from Russian terror are needed now, not later. Every day of delay, unfortunately, means more lost lives,â€ť he said.

92,"UK walks tightrope with hardened stance on Israel, faces backlash",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/uk-walks-tightrope-with-hardened-stance-on-israel-faces-backlash-12813789.html,World,2024-09-03 22:04:00+05:30,"The backlash to Britain's suspension of some arms exports to Israel shows the fine line the Labour government has to tread in its relations with its Middle Eastern ally. While suggesting it will be tougher towards Israel than Conservative predecessors, the suspension also highlights Labour's difficulty in pleasing both Jewish groups with which it has worked hard to repair relations and its left-wing, largely pro-Palestinian base. The reaction to Monday's announcement indicates the size of that task: Britain's Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis said the decision ""beggars belief"" but human rights groups said it failed to go far enough. Foreign Secretary David Lammy told parliament that the UK would suspend 30 out of 350 arms exports licences, citing a ""clear risk"" that they could be used in a serious breach of international humanitarian law. He said the partial ban covered items ""which could be used in the current conflict in Gaza"", including fighter aircraft, helicopters and drones but does not include parts for Israel's advanced F-35 stealth fighter jets. Lammy announced a review into Israel's conduct of its war against Hamas militants shortly after centre-left Labour swept to power in a landslide general election victory over the Conservatives in early July. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour government has largely followed the same approach to the Israel-Hamas war as the Tories, repeatedly calling for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages and the speeding up of aid deliveries into Gaza. However, some notable differences have emerged. The arms announcement followed decisions in July to resume funding for the UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) and drop a legal challenge over international arrest warrants for senior Israeli figures. And last week the UK foreign ministry said it was ""deeply"" concerned by an Israeli military operation in the occupied West Bank, urging it to ""exercise restraint"" and adhere to international law. ""It's a change of tone most certainly,"" politics professor Steven Fielding told AFP. ""But I would say it's more a government which is trying to negotiate a very tricky path in terms of Britain's relations with Israel while also not giving it a free pass to do whatever it wants."" On July 19, Lammy announced that the UK was lifting a funding suspension for UNRWA. The pause had been imposed in January over Israeli claims that some UNRWA staff were involved in Hamas's October 7 attack that resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. 'Government of lawyers' Israel's military response against Hamas has so far killed at least 40,819 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry. The UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children. On July 26, Downing Street confirmed it was dropping the previous government's legal challenge to arrest warrants sought by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others over alleged war crimes. If granted, Britain as an ICC member state would technically be obliged to arrest Netanyahu and the others if they travelled to the UK. Fielding says legal concerns are largely driving the Labour government's approach rather than a desire to be pro-Palestinian or pro-Israel. ""This is a government of lawyers more than most,"" he said, referring to both Harvard Law School graduate Lammy and Starmer, a former human rights lawyer and chief state prosecutor. ""It is a government that was elected to say it wanted to do politics properly, and that does mean following legal advice,"" added Fielding, of the University of Nottingham. The left-leaning New Statesman magazine agreed, declaring in its morning newsletter Tuesday that Lammy was ""determined to be a champion of international law"". ""This, in short, is not a government that is likely to leave itself legally exposed,"" the magazine wrote. Domestic political concerns are never far away though. Starmer has been credited with rebuilding trust with Jewish communities and rooting out anti-Semitism in the party since taking over as Labour leader from left-winger Jeremy Corbyn in 2020. But Labour's support for Israel's offensive hit its vote share at the election and led to several independents winning seats on a pro-Palestinian ticket at Labour's expense. ""It's advantageous that the (arms exports) decision also means that at least the party can present a more positive face to those with concerns about what Israel's doing,"" said Fielding.

A French judge put Russian-born Durov under formal investigation last week for suspected complicity in running an online platform that allows illicit transactions, child sex abuse images, drug trafficking and fraud. His lawyer has said it is ""absurd"" to suggest he should be held responsible for any crimes committed on the app, which has nearly 1 billion users and is widely popular in Russia, Ukraine and other former Soviet countries. Lavrov, in a speech to students at Moscow's elite MGIMO university run by the foreign ministry, echoed the Kremlin's position that the probe into Durov is part of a larger political ploy by the West to exert power over Russia. ""Pavel Durov was too free,"" Lavrov said. ""He didn't listen to Western advice on moderating his brainchild."" Russia, after years of pressure on Durov and his tech ventures, has rallied behind him. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last week that there were no negotiations between the Kremlin and Durov, who also holds passports from France and the United Arab Emirates. ""The main thing is that what is happening in France does not turn into political persecution,"" Peskov said last Thursday. ""We know that the president of France has denied any connection (of the case) with politics, but on the other hand, certain accusations are being made."" French President Emmanuel Macron has denied any political motive in the tech entrepreneur's detention. Lavrov earlier warned that Durov's arrest - the first of a major tech CEO - had plunged relations between Moscow and Paris to a new nadir.

An overnight air strike in Tulkarem, targeting militants, tragically resulted in the death of a 15-year-old Palestinian, according to a hospital source in the city. The Palestinian health ministry stated, ""There are 30 martyrs and about 130 wounded in the West Bank since Wednesday,"" when Israeli forces began their coordinated raids. This toll includes three deaths in the Hebron area in the southern West Bank, which are not related to the northern raids. As Israelâ€™s significant ""counter-terrorism"" operation in the northern West Bank entered its seventh day, the focus remained on Jenin. The Palestinian health ministry reported at least 18 deaths in Jenin since Wednesday. The military announced that on Monday, its forces killed 14 militants in Jenin and apprehended ""25 terrorists."" In a separate incident, the health ministry reported that a 16-year-old girl was killed by the Israeli army in Kfar Dan, Jenin governorate, though it was unclear if she was included in the 18 deaths reported in the area. An AFP correspondent noted that Jeninâ€™s streets were deserted and shops closed on Tuesday, with Israeli armoured vehicles, bulldozers, and ambulances visible. Israeli bulldozers have overturned paved streets to uncover hidden explosive devices, according to the army. The Jenin city council reported that 70 percent of the roads and streets have been destroyed since the raid began. Municipality spokesman Bashir Matahen mentioned that about 20 kilometres of water, sewage, communication, and electricity lines were damaged, including 80 percent of the city's water pipes. The municipality lacks the funds for necessary repairs. Jenin and its nearby refugee camp have been strongholds of Palestinian armed groups resisting Israeli occupation since 1967. While the Israeli military frequently conducts incursions into Palestinian areas, simultaneous operations as seen recently in the northern West Bank are rare. Surging Violence In Tulkarem, near Jenin, the Israeli military reported on Monday night that its aircraft targeted a Palestinian militant cell ""that shot at security forces during the counter-terrorism operation."" A medical source at Tulkarem government hospital told AFP that a 15-year-old was killed in the strike, which also injured his father and four others. The Palestinian Red Crescent reported treating several shrapnel injuries in Tulkarem, including one involving a paramedic. On Tuesday, Israeli military vehicles, including bulldozers, were observed on Tulkaremâ€™s streets, where roads have been damaged or destroyed, according to an AFP journalist. One man stood defiantly with a Palestinian flag in front of the bulldozers. Further south, Israeli forces raided the Birzeit University campus near Ramallah before dawn, confiscating property from the student council, the institution said. Violence has surged in the Palestinian territories since Hamas's October 7 attack triggered conflict in Gaza, which is separated from the West Bank by Israeli territory. According to UN figures, at least 637 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the Gaza war began, while Israeli officials report at least 23 Israelis, including soldiers, have been killed in Palestinian attacks during the same period.

However, Kyiv may face several months' wait due to technical preparations. Official sources indicated that the inclusion of JASSMs in a forthcoming autumn weapons package has yet to be finalised. The sources declined to be named because they were not authorised to discuss the topic. Military analysts have suggested that the deployment of these stealthy, precision-guided missiles could significantly shift the conflict's dynamics by extending Ukraine's strike capability, potentially targeting Russian staging areas and supply depots from hundreds of miles away. This move, a key concern for the Biden administration, could complicate Russiaâ€™s military operations and offer Ukraine a substantial strategic advantage. Launching them from points near Ukraine's northern border with Russia could allow them to hit military installations as far away as the Russian cities of Voronezh and Bryansk. In the south, dropping them near the front lines could enable strikes on airfields or naval facilities in Crimea. The JASSM has so far only been integrated into US-designed aircraft. Ukraine will ultimately operate several dozen F-16s, each of which can carry two of the cruise missiles. One of the US officials said there were efforts to make the missile operable with non-Western fighter jets in Ukraine's inventory, which has not been reported previously. Although the official did not provide further detail on which jets in Ukraine's inventory JASSM could be used with, they operate Soviet-era MiG-29, Su-24 and Su-27 jets. Politico reported last month the Biden administration was ""open"" to giving Ukraine JASSMs. Ukraine's need for more arms, and more powerful weaponry, is growing as it continues to face intense pressure from Russian forces along its eastern front. Older-model JASSMs, which are made by Lockheed Martin Corp, have a range of about 230 miles (370 km). The missiles, about 14 feet (4 m) long, are designed to be somewhat stealthy, making them difficult to spot on radar. They can also fly close to the ground and can be programmed to take circuitous routes that avoid air defenses. There is also a longer-range JASSM missile that can fly more than 500 miles. Reuters could not immediately establish which of the two types Washington was considering, but providing the shorter-range missiles would put less strain on its stockpiles. Giving Ukraine JASSMs would also add pressure for Washington to drop restrictions on how Ukraine uses US weaponry because their effects would be limited if they were not cleared for use on targets inside Russia, said a congressional staffer who works on the issue. The US has been reluctant to supply weapons that could strike targets deep inside Russia for fear it would escalate the conflict. Kyiv's allies have been supplying weapons but with restrictions on how and when they can be used inside Russia, out of concern such strikes could prompt retaliation that draws NATO countries into the war or provokes a nuclear conflict. Each JASSM has a large, 1,000-pound warhead, but unlike the Storm Shadow and SCALP missiles already provided to Kyiv by Britain and France, it is not explicitly designed to penetrate hardened bunkers. The newest versions cost about $1 million each. Global Positioning System (GPS) signals and an inertial navigation system provide guidance. When it nears its target, an infrared imaging seeker can help steer it to an impact point with an accuracy of about 10 feet (3 m). Although older models might be less resistant to electronic warfare than the current iteration of JASSM, the infrared seeker would help it find its target even amid heavy jamming, said George William Herbert of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California. ""They're pretty stealthy, but not completely designed around maximum stealth,"" Herbert said. ""A few years ago, a bunch were fired at Syria after chemical weapons incidents, and Russian air defense systems in the country failed to shoot many down, possibly none of them. ""I would expect that carefully planned missile flight paths would let JASSM be effective almost anywhere in the war area."" (Inputs From Reuters)

The attack resulted in at least 41 deaths and over 180 injuries. In a video statement, Zelenskyy detailed that two ballistic missiles struck the city, damaging a building at the Institute of Communications. ""More than 180 people were injured. Unfortunately, there are many dead. As of now, 41 people have been reported dead,"" Zelensky said, after two ballistic missiles ""hit the territory of an educational institution and a neighbouring hospital.""I received preliminary reports on the Russian strike in Poltava. According to available information, two ballistic missiles hit the area. They targeted an educational institution and a nearby hospital, partially destroying one of the telecommunications institute's buildings. pic.twitter.com/TNppPr1OwFVolodymyr Zelenskyy / (@ZelenskyyUa) September 3, 2024 The strike appeared to be one of the deadliest carried out by Russian forces since the war began more than 900 days ago on February 24, 2022. The missiles hit shortly after the air raid alert sounded, when many people were on their way to a bomb shelter, Ukraine's Defence Ministry said, describing the strike as â€śbarbaric.â€ť Zelenskiy said in a video that Russian forces struck with two ballistic missiles, damaging a building of the Military Institute of Communications. He ordered a full and prompt investigation. ""The Russian scum will definitely be held accountable for this strike,"" Zelenskiy said on the Telegram messaging app. According to the foreign ministry, the type of weapons used left little time for people to find cover once the air alert had sounded. Photographs posted on social media in Ukraine showed several bodies lying on the ground covered in dust and debris, with the badly damaged side of a large building behind them. Reuters could not immediately verify the images. ""One of the institute's buildings was partially destroyed, and many people were trapped under the rubble,"" the defence ministry said on Telegram. ""Thanks to the coordinated work of rescuers and medics, 25 people were rescued, 11 of whom were taken from the rubble. The rescuers are currently continuing their work."" Russia had yet to comment on the attack. Russia has intensified its missile and drone attacks on Ukraine two-and-a-half years into the full-scale war. Last week Ukraine was pummeled with the heaviest bombardment to date, and on Monday ballistic and cruise missiles targeted Kyiv causing loud explosions. Ukraine also targeted Russia with more than 158 drones at the weekend, damaging an oil refinery near Moscow and a power station. Zelenskiy repeated his calls for more Western air defences and urged allies to allow their long-range weapons to be used for strikes deeper into Russian territory in order to protect Ukraine. ""We keep telling everyone in the world who has the power to stop this terror: air defence systems and missiles are needed in Ukraine, not in a warehouse somewhere. ""Long-range strikes that can protect us from Russian terror are needed now, not some time later. Unfortunately, every day of delay means loss of life."" In Poltava, some 300 km (186 miles) southeast of Kyiv and 120 km to the nearest Russian border, governor Filip Pronin said that many residents had donated blood for the injured. Local authorities announced three days of mourning. The identities of the victims were not immediately disclosed. Serhiy Beskrestnov, a prominent Ukrainian Telegram blogger followed by many radio, communications and Electronic Warfare specialists in Ukraine's military, posted a tribute to ""my signals operator comrades"". Fighting has intensified over the past month, with Russian forces advancing in heavy battles in eastern Ukraine, while Kyiv's troops have mounted their first large-scale cross-border assault into a Russian region, for which Moscow has vowed to retaliate.

Some members term this as a crisis similar to the one that the party faced after the assassination of founder Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1975.The catalyst for the current catastrophe was the dramatic ousting of Sheikh Hasina, the five-time Prime Minister and leader of the Awami League (AL) since 1981, who fled to India on August 5 following a protracted protest, mainly by students, over quotas in government jobs.Hasinaâ€™s decision to flee rather than face the crisis has been criticised by party insiders as a betrayal, leaving many of her closest allies feeling abandoned and disillusioned.â€śOur supreme leader should not have left us, leaving the entire party in the lurch. Had she been here, the situation would have been different. In case, she had been arrested, we could have said that our leader had not fled,â€ť Badruzamman, a local-level leader from the Mirpur area, said.He lamented that Hasinaâ€™s advisers were the root cause of all problems. â€śThe advisers Sheikh Hasina had were all useless. They brought her down. She too only liked sycophants and did not listen to the ground reality,â€ť he said.A senior Awami League leader, who is into hiding, told PTI over the phone: â€śThe party is in a crisis of unprecedented magnitude. Our very existence is in crisis. Even if the elections are held in Bangladesh, we might not be able to contest the polls.â€ť Hasina's abrupt downfall amid a massive anti-government movement has left a leadership vacuum and most other leaders have fled, or gone into hiding, or are in jail.â€śThe party is in complete disarray after August 5. There is no one left in the country who can lead the party. Sheikh Hasinaâ€™s fleeing the country has further worsened the situation. We donâ€™t know what lies ahead,â€ť an AL supporter, who did not wish to be named, said.Partyâ€™s offices across the country that used to bustle with supporters and activists, now wear a deserted look after being ransacked by mob fury even as 95 per cent of the offices remained locked up.Partyâ€™s second-in-command Obaidul Quader â€“ who too is on the run after the August 5 uprising, just like other senior leaders â€“ has been implicated in orchestrating violent crackdowns on protesters, leaving the party without a clear successor.Other potential leaders within the Awami League, such as Assauduzamman Khan Jamal and Hasan Mahmud, were detained while attempting to flee the country. They have either been implicated in the recent turmoil or gone into hiding to escape the backlash, with many facing legal challenges and public ire.â€śThe party, after the assassination of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1975, faced a similar crisis. But then several leaders were still active and able to engage in political activities. This time, the situation is worse,â€ť he said.The Hasina-led party in the 2008 elections, largely considered as the last free and fair elections in Bangladesh, had secured 48 per cent of the votes, with the principal opposition BNP securing 32 per cent.During its days in opposition from 1991 to 1996 and then from 2001 to 2006, the Awami League had consistently garnered 35-40 per cent of the popular vote.â€śShe initially insisted on using greater force to suppress the protests. When the situation became unmanageable, she decided to step down and flee the country. This abrupt exit is an undignified likely end to her long political innings, and it has left the Awami League in disarray,â€ť said 75-year-old Asif Hasan Pintu, whose family has been Awami League supporters since Sheikh Mujibur Rahmanâ€™s time. Bangabir Kader Siddique, president of the Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Janata League drew attention to how Awami League's reliance on dynastic politics has created a challenging situation.â€śAfter Sheikh Mujibâ€™s death, the concentration of control of the party went into the hands of his family. This has spelt disaster for the present-day Awami League,â€ť Siddique, who fought in the Bangladesh Liberation War 1971, said.He was a loyalist of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and had walked out of the party in early 2000s over differences with Hasina to form his own political outfit.â€śThe Awami League of Bangabandhu, which was the party of the poor and brought independence to Bangladesh, is not the same as Sheikh Hasina's Awami League,â€ť he said.

This historic visit commemorates 40 years of diplomatic relations between India and Brunei and follows a personal invitation from Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, the world's second-longest reigning monarch. As a special gesture, Prime Minister Modi was received by Crown Prince Al-Muhtadee Billah at the airport. Modi was accorded a warm welcome and given a guard of honour at the airport. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, who will be hosting Prime Minister Modi, is known for his influence and the unique status Brunei holds on the global stage. Who is Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah? Born on July 15, 1946, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah is the 29th and current Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei. He ascended the throne on October 5, 1967, after his father, Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III, abdicated in his favour. With over five decades of rule, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah stands as one of the longest-serving current heads of state in the world. Sultanâ€™s Wealth and LifestyleSultan Hassanal Bolkiah is renowned not only for his lengthy reign and political influence but also for his immense wealth and extravagant lifestyle. His net worth is estimated at around $28 billion, placing him among the globe's wealthiest individuals. The Sultanâ€™s opulent lifestyle is the stuff of legend. He is famous for his vast collection of luxury cars, reportedly owning over 7,000 vehicles, including rare and custom-made models from Rolls-Royce, Ferrari, and Bentley. His private jet, a Boeing 747, is also famously adorned with gold accents and luxurious fittings. The Istana Nurul Iman PalaceA striking symbol of Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah's wealth is his official residence, the Istana Nurul Iman Palace. This magnificent palace is the largest residential palace in the world, sprawling over 2.15 million square feet. Located near the Brunei River, just a few kilometers from the capital, Bandar Seri Begawan, the palace is an architectural marvel. The palace was designed by Filipino architect Leandro V. Locsin and completed in 1984. Istana Nurul Iman boasts 1,788 rooms, including 257 bathrooms, a banquet hall that can host up to 5,000 guests, and a mosque with a capacity for 1,500 people. The palace also houses five swimming pools, a stable for the Sultan's prized polo ponies, and an extensive garage housing his remarkable car collection. Notably, the palace is also the venue for official state functions and the Sultan's annual birthday celebrations, where he opens the palace to thousands of citizens and visitors.

100,"US Polls 2024: Kamala Harris gains Hispanic voter support, neutralises Trump's economic edge, says survey",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/us-polls-2024-kamala-harris-gains-hispanic-voter-support-neutralises-trumps-economic-edge-12813612.html,World,2024-09-03 17:10:00+05:30,"Kamala Harris has neutralized Donald Trump's edge on the economy among Hispanic voters, and her 13 percentage point lead within that group reflects the fact they vastly prefer her approach to healthcare and climate change, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows. On those latter issues, Hispanics favor Democratic Vice President Harris' approach over Republican former President Trump's by wide margins -- 18 points for healthcare and 23 points for climate change. A diverse and fast-growing slice of the U.S. electorate who are swing voters, Hispanics are an attractive target for both candidates in a contest that was shaken up in July when Democratic President Joe Biden folded his flagging re-election campaign and passed the torch to Harris. The Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted Aug. 21-28, showed that the top issues for Hispanic registered voters ahead of the Nov. 5 election largely track those of the country at large, with the economy, immigration, healthcare and climate change standing out as the group's top priorities. While registered voters overall favor Trump's approach to the economy over Harris' by 45% to 36%, Hispanic registered voters viewed them equally, with each drawing 39% support. That reflects an improvement for Democrats, after a Reuters/Ipsos poll in May showed Biden trailing Trump by 4 points on the economy in Hispanic voters' eyes. Hispanic voters preferred Harris on healthcare policy, by 46% to 29%, and on climate change, with a 46% to 23% lead, bigger leads than she held among the broader electorate, which also favored her on those two issues. Trump held the advantage on immigration policy, with Hispanic voters preferring him over Harris 42% to 37%, narrower than his 46% to 36% lead among the broader electorate. ""The Latino vote is probably the most pure swing group of voters in America right now and will be for a long time,"" said Chuck Rocha, a Democratic strategist who advised Bernie Sanders' 2016 campaign, including on Latino outreach. ASPIRATIONAL STORY Rocha said Harris, who is Black and of South Asian descent and whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Jamaica and India, is winning support from Hispanics by telling an aspirational life story that has countered Trump's strength on the economy, where he has a 20 point lead among white voters. Many Hispanic voters have parents or grandparents who immigrated to the United States, and their lower-than-average incomes left them more vulnerable to the surge in U.S. inflation in 2021 and 2022. Trump leads on the economy among men and voters aged 35 and older, while he and Harris are closely matched among women and younger Americans, the new Reuters/Ipsos poll showed. Harris has a strong lead on the economy among Black voters. The poll was conducted nationally and gathered responses from 4,253 U.S. adults, including 3,562 registered voters and 412 Hispanic registered voters. It had margins of error of about 2 percentage points for voters overall and about 4 points for Hispanics. Hispanics made up about 14% of voting age U.S. citizens in 2022, up from 9% in Census Bureau estimates for 2005-2009.Â Biden won the Hispanic vote by 21 points in 2020, according to an exit poll analysis by Pew Research, so Harris' current 13 point lead among registered Hispanic voters, should it hold through Election Day, would signal an improvement for Trump. Republican strategists say even with Harris' gains on the economy relative to Biden, Trump is still doing well with Hispanics. ""Hispanics have historically strongly favored the Democratic Party, so for Trump to be breaking even with Harris on the economy has to be seen as a win for him,"" Giancarlo Sopo, a Republican strategist who led Trumpâ€™s 2020 media outreach targeting Hispanic voters. U.S. inflation has cooled over the last year and in June consumer prices fell for the first time in four years amid cheaper gasoline and moderating rents. Voter sympathies could shift between now and Election Day and it remains to be seen which, if any, blocs of voters will turn out in droves. Experts say predicting the Hispanic vote is particularly hard in 2024 because Hispanic voters skew younger than the rest of the electorate, so a larger share are first time voters. ""It could be anybodyâ€™s race still,"" said University of Arizona political scientist Lisa M. Sanchez.

Dhaka Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Mahbubul Haque's court issued acquittal orders in four cases whereas Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Tofazzal Hossain's court acquitted her in one case on Tuesday, The Dhaka Tribune newspaper reported. The defendant, 79-year-old Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson Zia, was acquitted after the plaintiff did not appear in court. In August 2016, a case was filed against Zia by a journalist for celebrating a â€śfake birthdayâ€ť. The complaint alleged that although five different birthdates of Zia were found through various sources, none was on August 15. It said that despite this, she has been celebrating her birthday on August 15, which is the national mourning day commemorating the assassination of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman since 1996. The complaint alleged that the BNP leader celebrates her birthday on this day solely to tarnish the reputation of Bangabandhu and his family. In November 2016, a case was filed by AB Siddique, president of Bangladesh Jananetri Parishad, against Zia for allegedly supporting war criminals. In January 2017, Siddique filed a defamation case accusing Zia, accusing her of slander regarding Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the Awami League. The case mentioned a speech delivered by Zia as the chief guest at the anniversary celebration of the Chhatra Dal in December 2016, wherein she allegedly said that Bangabandhu Rahman did not want Bangladeshâ€™s independence but aspired to become the prime minister of undivided Pakistan. The complaint alleged that her statement was defamatory. In January 2016, Siddique filed a case against Zia and BNP leader Gayeshwar Chandra Roy for derogatory comments about the victims of the Liberation War. In November 2016, the BNP chairperson was accused in another defamation and threat of murder case filed by Siddique. Zia was under house arrest for the past five years and returned to her home from the hospital as a free person following a presidential pardon last month. She was acquitted of all charges against her following the fall of the Awami League government led by her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina on August 5. Zia served as the prime minister of Bangladesh from March 1991 to March 1996, and again from June 2001 to October 2006.

The warrant has accused Putin of war crimes related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Russian President had ordered the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, which threw the region into a state of conflict. The visit by Putin hasÂ now left Mongolia in a tight spot. Despite calls from Ukraine and the European Union to detain Putin, Mongolia showed no signs of complying with the international warrant. In fact, Mongolian President Khurelsukh Ukhnaa welcomed Putin in Ulaanbaatar with a formal ceremony. The two leaders discussed their bilateral relationship and future cooperation. Khurelsukh also accepted an invitation to attend a BRICS summit in Kazan later this year. The Rome Statute requires member countries to arrest suspects. But due to lack of enforcement mechanisms, the ruling cannot be enforced. Moreover, Mongolia relies heavily on Russia for energy, complicating its response. However, Mongoliaâ€™s defiance of iCC obligations could have legal consequences. According to a report in the BBC, that if countries fail to comply with the arrest warrant, ICC judges may make a finding and inform the Assembly of States Parties of it. ""It is then for the Assembly to take any measure it deems appropriate,"" an official said, without specifying what actions can be taken. The official said that Netherlands-based ICC does allow for some exemptions to the rule, such as when a country could be forced to â€śbreach a treaty obligationâ€ť with another state or where it would violate â€śdiplomatic immunity of a person or property of a third state.â€ť According to a report in CNBC, legal experts have warned that Mongoliaâ€™s failure to fulfil its obligations to the ICC could lead to prosecution. Putinâ€™s visit included a ceremony marking the 85th anniversary of a Soviet-Mongolian victory over Japan in 1939. Russian state media reported that a small group of protesters with a Ukrainian flag was detained by police. EU spokesperson Nabila Massrali noted Mongolia's obligation under the Rome Statute but acknowledged its right to shape its international relations. Over 50 Russians have petitioned Mongolia to arrest Putin, including Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was recently released from a Russian prison. Russian Deputy Security Council Secretary Dmitry Medvedev dismissed the arrest warrant as â€śillegalâ€ť and criticized those seeking to enforce it. Putinâ€™s trip to Mongolia is part of his broader efforts to counter international isolation, following recent visits to China, North Korea, Vietnam, and Kazakhstan. Enkhgerel Seded, a student in Moscow, remarked that historically, friendly countries do not arrest visiting heads of state, suggesting Mongolia may follow this tradition.

The village of Kallio was submerged in the late 1970s when the Mornos dam was built 200 kilometres (124 miles) west of the capital, the artificial lake fed by the Mornos and Evinos rivers. With lake levels down by 30 percent in recent months according to state water operator EYDAP, the ruins of a school and houses have reappeared. ""The level of Lake Mornos has dropped by 40 metres (131 feet),"" said Yorgos Iosifidis, a 60-year-old pensioner who had to leave his home as a young man along with the other villagers when the area was flooded. ""You see the first floor that remains of my father-in-law's two-storey house... and next to it you can see what's left of my cousins' house,"" Iosifidis, who now lives higher up the hill, told AFP. Drought worsened this year in the Mediterranean country that is well accustomed to summer heat waves. After the mildest winter on record, Greece had its hottest July on record, according to preliminary weather data from the national observatory. This came after similarly record-breaking temperatures in June. Nearly 80 houses in Kallio, in addition to the church and school, were ""sacrificed"" to supply Athens with water, Kallio village chairman Apostolis Gerodimos told state agency ANA. This is the second time Kallio has reappeared, after another period of drought in the early 1990s, said Iosifidis. ""If it doesn't rain soon, the level will drop further and the problem will be more acute than it was then,"" he said. Anastasis Papageorgiou, 26, a doctor who lives in Amygdalia, a village near Mornos, said the area has seen very little rain or snow in the last two years. ""The situation is difficult at the moment, so we have to be careful with water,"" he said. The Greek authorities called on the 3.7 million inhabitants of Attica, the region surrounding Athens and home to a third of the Greek population, not to waste water. EYDAP has also tapped into additional reservoirs near the capital. On a visit to neighbouring Thessaly on Monday to discuss reconstruction works after last year's destructive floods, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said Greece had to improve its water management. ""We don't have the luxury to waste water... at a time when we know with certainty that we will have less water, we must protect water resources more methodically than we have done so far,"" Mitsotakis said. Greece uses 85 percent of its water for irrigation and needs to build more dams, the prime minister said.

The animals set to be killed include 83 elephants, 30 hippos, 60 buffaloes, 50 impalas, 100 blue wildebeest, 300 zebras, and 100 elands (a type of antelope). According to the UN, 84 percent of the country's food reserves have already been exhausted, and nearly half of its 2.5 million population is expected to face high levels of acute food insecurity between July and September. The southern African country--that had declared a state of emergency in May as the drought worsened--said in a press release that the culling would only take placeÂ in national parks and communal areas with sustainable wildlife numbers, is â€śnecessaryâ€ť and â€śin line with our constitutional mandate where our natural resources are used for the benefit of Namibian citizens.â€ť Professional hunters will carry out the cull and the meat will be distributed to those impacted by the drought, especially in rural areas, the release stated.

Authorities said that the culling of wild animals would not only provide food to the masses but alsoÂ reduce pressure on scarce water and grazing resources.  Among the animals being killed, elephants are specifically being targeted for their meat. (File photo: AFP) The decision is also aimed at minimising instances ofÂ human-wildlife conflict as animals move closer to human settlements in search of food and water during the drought. In such areas, elephants are specifically being targeted, the publication reported, adding that Namibia is among the countries with the largest elephant populations in the world. Although it has faced severe criticism due to its decision to kill wildlife for meat,Â authorities saidÂ it isÂ a necessary emergency measure in the face of theÂ current drought, exacerbated by climate change that has led to widespread crop failures and livestock deaths across southern Africa, leaving millions to starve.

The trip is Putin's first to a member country of the International Criminal Court since it issued the warrant about 18 months ago. Ahead of his visit, Ukraine called on Mongolia to hand Putin over to the court in The Hague, and the European Union expressed concern that Mongolia might not execute the warrant. A spokesperson for Putin said last week that the Kremlin wasn't worried. The warrant puts the Mongolian government in a tough spot. Member countries are required by the ICC's founding treaty, the Rome Statute, to detain suspects if an arrest warrant has been issued. But Mongolia, a landlocked country bordering Russia, is highly dependent on its much larger neighbour for fuel and some of its electricity. The court lacks a mechanism to enforce its warrants. The Russian leader was welcomed in the main square in Ulaanbaatar, the capital, by an honour guard dressed in vivid red and blue uniforms styled on those of the personal guard of 13th century ruler Genghis Khan, the founder of the Mongol Empire. He and Mongolian President Khurelsukh Ukhnaa walked up the red-carpeted steps of the Government Palace and bowed before a statue of Genghis Khan before entering the building for their meetings. A small group of protesters who tried to unfurl a Ukrainian flag before the welcome ceremony were taken away by police. Sitting down for talks with Khurelsukh, Putin said that relations between their two countries â€śare developing in all areas.â€ť He invited the Mongolian president to attend a summit of the BRICS nations â€” a group that includes Russia and China among others â€” in the Russian city of Kazan in late October. Khurelsukh accepted, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. The ICC has accused Putin of being responsible for the abductions of children from Ukraine, where the fighting has raged for 2Â˝ years. On Monday, the EU expressed concern that the ICC warrant might not be executed and said it has shared its concern with Mongolian authorities. â€śMongolia, like all other countries, has the right to develop its international ties according to its own interests,â€ť European Commission spokeswoman Nabila Massrali said. But she added, â€śMongolia is a state party to the Rome Statute of the ICC since 2002, with the legal obligations that it entails.â€ť More than 50 Russians outside the country have signed an open letter urging the government of Mongolia to â€śimmediately detain Vladimir Putin upon his arrival.â€ť The signers include Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was freed from a Russian prison in August in the biggest East-West prisoner swap since the Cold War. Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy secretary of Russia's Security Council, denounced the warrant against Putin as â€śillegalâ€ť in an online statement Tuesday and those who would try to carry it out as â€śmadmen.â€ť Putin, on his first visit to Mongolia in five years, will join a ceremony to mark the 85th anniversary of a joint Soviet and Mongolian victory over Japan's army that controlled Manchuria in northeast China. Thousands of soldiers on both sides died in 1939 in months of fighting over the border's location between Manchuria and Mongolia. â€śI am very delighted about Putin's visit to Mongolia,"" said Yansanjav Demdendorj, a retired economist, citing Russia's role against Japan. â€śIf we think of the â€¦ battle, it's Russians who helped free Mongolia.â€ť Putin has made a series of overseas trips in recent months to try to counter the international isolation he faces over the invasion of Ukraine. He visited China in May, made a trip to North Korea and Vietnam in June and went to Kazhakstan in July for a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Last year, he joined a meeting in Johannesburg by video link after the South African government lobbied against him showing up for the BRICS summit. South Africa, an ICC member, was condemned by activists and its main opposition party in 2015 when it didn't arrest then-Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir during a visit. Enkhgerel Seded, who studies at a university in Moscow, said that historically, countries with friendly relations don't arrest heads-of-state on official visits. â€śOur country has obligations toward the international community,"" she said. ""But â€¦ I think in this case as well, it would not be appropriate to conduct an arrest.â€ť

As per the New York Post, the accident reportedly occurred when Longo was nearing the summit.Â Longo led Audiâ€™s operations in Italy since 2013. A fellow climber witnessed the fall and immediately alerted rescue teams, who quickly responded. His body was located approximately 700 feet down a gorge and was pronounced dead at the scene. A helicopter later transported his body to a hospital in Carisolo for further examination. Notably, despite being well-equipped with safety gear, including steel cables and ladders to aid his ascent, the tragic accident occurred. An investigation is currently underway to determine the exact circumstances surrounding his death. Longoâ€™s family will announce funeral arrangements once the autopsy and other formalities are completed. Born in Rimini, Italy, in 1962, Fabrizio Longo held a degree in political science and began his career at Fiat in 1987. He later became the head of the Lancia brand in 2002 before joining Audi in 2012. He quickly rose through the ranks, taking charge of Audiâ€™s Italian operations in 2013. An Audi spokesperson described him as a source of unwavering support, noting his strong values and genuine care for his colleagues, which created a warm and respectful workplace. Under his leadership, Audi maintained its position as a premium brand leader in Italy for 11 consecutive years. Longo was also a passionate advocate for environmental conservation, frequently visiting the Adamello mountains and supporting efforts to protect the area from climate change. The International Ski and Snowboard Federation expressed deep sorrow over his loss, with its head, Flavio Roda, calling it a ""terrible loss"" for the federation and Audi Italia.

109,Netanyahuâ€™s conflicts of interest are hurting Israel over the war in Gaza,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/benjamin-netanyahus-conflicts-of-interest-are-hurting-israel-over-the-war-in-gaza-12813192.html,World,2024-09-03 12:28:00+05:30,"Thereâ€™s no job on earth less attractive than being a head of stateÂ forced to decide betweenÂ cutting a hostage deal with terrorists that risks encouragingÂ repetition, or consigning innocents to be murdered. Israelâ€™s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu knows this dilemma better than anyone. To get a single soldier back in 2011, he traded more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, including Yahya Sinwar, the current Hamas leader who more than a decade later masterminded the mass hostage grab of Oct. 7. So why was there so much anger against Netanyahu this weekend, rather than empathy for the burden he carries, afterÂ sixÂ hostages were killed by their minders in a Gaza tunnel? Hamas is, after all, the villainÂ of this piece;Â itâ€™s both kidnapperÂ andÂ executioner. Yet Netanyahuâ€™s refusal to agree to a cease-fire provoked the largest street protests of the war to date, as well as a nationwide strike by Israelâ€™s biggest trades union and the shuttering of malls and businesses in sympathy. Judging by the language of the protesters and hostage families, the answer lies in a profound lack of trust in the prime ministerâ€™s motivationsÂ as he makes these decisions of life,Â death, war and peace for others. Netanyahuâ€™s 180-degree change of approach to dealing with hostage takers may be one source of that mistrust. In the one-for-1,027 swap of 2011, for example, he said he was agreeing to releaseÂ even Hamas prisoners jailed for killingÂ IsraelisÂ becauseÂ ""the state of Israel does not abandon its soldiers and citizens.â€ť Now, he says Israel must do exactly that, rather than â€śsurrenderâ€ť to Hamas. A second reason lies in the details of what such a surrender would mean. Hamas has been heavily degraded as a fighting force, so no Israeli troops would be waving white flags. The capitulationÂ Netanyahu is ruling out would instead be very specific to the cease-fire negotiations, which have stalled over his late addition of a demand that Israeli forces should retain control of the so-called Philadelphi corridor. Netanyahu says commanding thisÂ a narrow strip of land along Gazaâ€™s border with Egypt is vital to Israelâ€™s security. Yet his own defense minister, Yoav Gallant, says that isnâ€™t true. Nor was the corridor even mentioned in Israelâ€™s original cease-fire proposal â€” an odd omission if it is indeed so critical as to warrant the sacrifice of more Jewish and Palestinian lives. â€śThe fact that we prioritize the Philadelphi Corridor at the cost of the lives of the hostages is a moral disgrace,â€ťÂ Gallant told Israelâ€™s security cabinet, which met on Sunday in the wake of the executions, according to a leaked report of the proceedings in the Times of Israel. Other top security officials also have said the corridor isnâ€™t a make-or-break issue, not least because the tunnels Hamas built under the Egyptian border to smuggle arms begin and end outside it. The deeper source of popular malaise, though, is that Netanyahu has so many apparent conflicts of interest. A prominent call from protesters is that the prime minister should â€śtake responsibility.â€ť Not only did Netanyahu set Sinwar free in 2011, but Oct. 7 also took place on his watch. There are many who will have to share responsibility for this spectacular security failure in the investigation thatâ€™s certain to follow the war;Â but as the prime minister who oversaw a policy of shifting attention and security resources to the West Bank from Gaza, Netanyahu wouldÂ top the list. Ending the war would accelerate other reckonings for the prime minister. The extreme-right leaders on whom he relies for power have made it clear they will bring down the government the moment he agrees to a cease-fire. They see the conflict as a once-in-a-life-time opportunity to expand Jewish settlement in both the West Bank and Gaza, a goal that requires the long-term military occupation of Palestinian territories. And should the government collapse, an out-of-powerÂ Netanyahu would face ongoing court cases on charges of fraud, breach of trust and bribery as an ordinary citizen. Jail time is aÂ realÂ possibility. Small wonder that so many Israelis believe Netanyahu is driven by personal, rather than national, interests on decisions that might end the fighting. Iâ€™m not at all certain that Netanyahu shares the views of his national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, who wants to replace Palestinians in Gaza with Jewish settlers and recently made an inflammatory call for the construction of a synagogue on the Temple Mount. Thatâ€™s been the site of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest site in Islam, since the 7th century. Nor can anyone outside Netanyahuâ€™s tightest circle be sure that this great political survivor is driven by anything other than his view of the national interest. But, as in all such cases, itâ€™sÂ the appearance of a conflict of interestÂ that counts, precisely because it erodes trust and encourages people to believe the worst. Netanyahu continues to enjoy domestic support for pursuing the destruction of Hamas. But as the implications for the remaining hostages of continuing the war become increasingly clear, this lack of trust in his motives is dividing the nation. Politicians around the democratic world have walked away from power over less. Credit: BloombergÂ  ",NA

112,5 people shot at New York's West Indian American Day Parade: Police,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/5-people-shot-at-new-yorks-west-indian-american-day-parade-police-12813089.html,World,2024-09-03 11:31:00+05:30,"Five people were shot Monday at New York Cityâ€™s West Indian American Day Parade, police said. It's the latest instance of violence marring one of the worldâ€™s largest annual celebrations of Caribbean culture. A gunman targeting a specific group of people opened fire along the parade route in Brooklyn around 2:35 p.m., NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell said. The parade had kicked off hours earlier, with thousands of revelers dancing and marching down Eastern Parkway, a main thoroughfare through the borough. It was expected to continue into the night. Two people were critically wounded, Chell said. The three other victims are expected to survive their injuries, he said. The gunman fled. â€śThis was not random,â€ť Chell said. â€śThis was an intentional act by one person towards a group of people. We do not by no means have any active shooter or anything of that nature running around Eastern Parkway as we speak. The parade is going on and will go on until later on tonight.â€ť An Associated Press videographer who was nearby when the shots rang out saw at least two people being treated next for what appeared to be wounds to the face and arm. Police cordoned off an area adjacent to the parade route, where they had placed crime scene markers. The parade continued flowing past as officers were seen bagging items. Chell asked that bystanders provide police with any video footage they may have recorded of the shooting. â€śWe need that video,â€ť Chell said. â€śWe are going to solve this, but itâ€™s going to take a lot of work.â€ť Some people attending the parade were shaken by the violence. â€śIâ€™m crying over this, itâ€™s so terrible. How can someone have the heart to fire a gun around so many people â€” babies, children, the elderly,â€ť Jalissa Bailey told the New York Post. ""I know this parade has a history of violence, but things have been peaceful in recent years, and we got to hoping that there was enough security in place that maybe that was over with,â€ť Bailey said. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was marching in the parade at the time and completed the route. â€śIâ€™m pained and troubled by the horrible shooting that took place as we were marching together at the West Indian Day Festival and Parade in Brooklyn,â€ť Schumer posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. â€śThank you to our 1st responders on the scene. I pray for everyone affected. We must keep working to end gun violence in America.â€ť The parade, an annual Labor Day event in its 57th year, turns Eastern Parkway into a kaleidoscope of feather-covered costumes and colorful flags as participants make their way down the thoroughfare alongside floats stacked high with speakers playing soca and reggae music. The parade routinely attracts huge crowds, who line the almost 2-mile (3.2-kilometer) route that runs from Crown Heights to the Brooklyn Museum. Itâ€™s also a popular destination for local politicians, many of whom have West Indian heritage or represent members of the cityâ€™s large Caribbean community. Though a joyous occasion, the parade and related celebrations have been plagued by violence over the years. In 2016, two people were killed and several others were wounded near the parade route. The year before, Carey Gabay, an aide to then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo was shot in the head during pre-parade festivities. He died nine days later. The West Indian American Day Parade has its roots in more traditionally timed, pre-Lent Carnival celebrations started by a Trinidadian immigrant in Manhattan around a century ago, according to the organizers. The festivities were moved to the warmer time of year in the 1940s. Brooklyn, where hundreds of thousands of Caribbean immigrants and their descendants have settled, began hosting the parade in the 1960s. The Labor Day parade is now the culmination of days of carnival events in the city, which includes a steel pan band competition and Jâ€™Ouvert, a separate street party commemorating freedom from slavery.

The carrier said it had cancelled 24 return flights operating until the end of Tuesday, and that a number of aircraft would be out of service for several days while the process, which it described as precautionary, was completed. An Airbus spokesperson referred questions to the airline and to Rolls-Royce RR.L, which said it was aware of the incident and was committed to working closely with Cathay, Airbus and authorities conducting an investigation. Shares in the company - the sole engine provider for the Airbus A350 family of long-haul jets - closed down more than 6% and dragged Europe's defence and aerospace index down 2.8% According to Flightradar24 data, the problem apparently unfolded several minutes after take-off as flight CX383 initially headed out over the sea, south of Hong Kong. Instead of immediately turning north for the roughly 12-hour journey to Zurich, the aircraft performed two wide circles before returning to Hong Kong where it landed safely about 75 minutes after take-off, according to the tracking data. Cathay did not describe the failed engine component in detail but said it was the first of its type to suffer such failure on any A350 aircraft worldwide. ""Thus far we have identified a number of the same engine components that need to be replaced. Spare parts have been secured and repair work is underway,"" it said. A person familiar with the matter said the incident involved a problem with a fuel nozzle, a component that directs fuel inside the engine. Experts say such problems are rare but, barring a deeper flaw, generally raise fewer alarms than the failure of one of the major rotating parts such as a turbine blade. However, any widespread further inspections could be disruptive to airlines. HONG KONG PROBE Industry sources said Hong Kong's Air Accident Investigation Authority had quickly launched an investigation. The bureau could not be reached for comment outside office hours. Britain's Air Accidents Investigation Branch said it would support any investigation carried out in Hong Kong. According to Flightradar24 data, the diverted aircraft is an A350-1000, the larger of two models of twin-engined A350. These are powered by the XWB-97, Rolls' largest civil jet engine. Cathay operates 18 of the largest twin-engined Airbus planes as part of a mixed fleet of Airbus and Boeing jets. It is one of the largest users of the A350-1000 alongside British Airways, which also has 18 in operation, but behind the largest operator, Qatar Airways, according to Airbus data. There were no immediate reports of similar findings at other airlines. Other operators of the A350-1000 did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is responsible for overseeing Airbus jets and has the power to order fleet-wide checks or repairs, did not rule out taking action but said it would wait for the results of the probe. ""We will be monitoring any information coming out of the technical investigation and will take decisions on any fleet level action as required,"" a spokesperson said. In total, Cathay operates 48 A350 jets including the smaller and more widely used A350-900, which runs on a different member of the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engine family called the XWB-84. The airline said it was coordinating with the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department and the jet and engine manufacturers. Cathay has around 100 planes currently on order including freighters, narrow-bodies and wide-bodies, with rights to acquire another 80.

The company flagged that it will look into blending domestic coal for operations to reduce reliance on imports and protect its bottom-line from supply chain shocks. As the infrastructure-led domestic demand remains robust, SAIL is looking to expand the crude steel production capacity from the existing 19.10 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) to 35.65 MTPA by the year 2031. ""At SAIL, we are on track to excel in two focus areas: to maximise capacity utilisation and to provide the bestvalue to our customers in order to safeguard against the vagaries of market fluctuations,"" chairman Amarendu Prakash said in a note to shareholders.Â  The comments come as the domestic steel prices plunged over a three-year low weighed down by rising inventories and globally weak prices. The outlook for the Indian steel market remains challenging in the short term, with continued downward pressure on prices likely, analytics firm BigMint wrote in its note published on September 2. Prakash highlighted that business at SAIL was impacted byÂ ""several macro-economic challenges like upcoming new capacities, trade measure initiatives, inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, interest rate hikes by central banks, and moderating demand in China resulting in pressure on pricing and excess availability of steel products."" For FY 2023-24,Â SAIL'sÂ turnover stood atÂ  RsÂ  1 lakh crore for the third consecutive year. With a sales turnover of Rs 1.05 lakh crore during FYâ€™24, which was 1 percent higher than the previous year.Â  Amid the volatility of raw material prices, the company is now looking for ""strategic interventions in securing raw materials, improving the quality of inputs, reducing business risks over the long term in resource mobilization."" Coking coal is a key raw material that is used in the manufacture of steel and any movement in its prices impacts the price of steel. Indian companies including SAIL are dependent on countries like Australia and Russia to import coking coal. Last year, SAIL flagged that the company is looking to increase coking coal purchases from Russia due to cheaper prices. However, to reduce dependence on imports,Â SAIL is working towards incorporating a blended coal mix, with a higher proportion of indigenous coal. This shift aims to reduce the company's dependence on imported coking coal, ultimately helping to curb the outflow of valuable foreign currency while enhancing domestic resource utilization, according to the annual report.

For example, in the Rs 1,000-2,000 crore sized IPO segment, the fee percentage for bankers improved from 2.2 percentage in FY20 to 2.7 per cent in FY24, while in the same period the fee percentage in the Rs 2,000-5,000 crore segment increased marginally from 1.5 to 1.6 per cent, data shows. â€śThis upward trend is evident across other issue sizes as well, demonstrating the growing value that merchant bankers bring to the table in a thriving IPO market,â€ť stated the DAM Capital prospectus. It is not just the fee percentages that have gone up, data shows that the average fee percentage IPO banker has also gone up significantly. For instance, the average fee per banker for issue sizes of Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,000 crore has increased by 2.3 times from Rs 4.75 crore in FY20 to Rs 10.93 crore in FY24. â€śThis increase underscores the enhanced income in the industry, reflecting the heightened demand for skilled financial advisory services in the capital markets,â€ť stated the prospectus . â€śOverall, the data clearly indicates that the merchant banking industry is experiencing robust growth, driven by increased market activity and higher fee structures,â€ť it added. Robust IPO pipelineAs of August, there are 23 companies which had filed for IPO and have received the approval from Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and estimated issue amount of these IPOs is more than Rs 14,000 crore, as per Prime Database. Additionally, there are 38 companies, which have filed for IPO, but are awaiting approval from the regulator. The estimated issue amount of these IPOs is more than Rs 83,500 crore.

117,GST Rate Rationalisation: Impact on different industries and challenges in tax simplification,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/gst-rate-rationalisation-impact-on-different-industries-and-challenges-in-tax-simplification-12815835.html,Economy,2024-09-06 10:34:00+05:30,"By Smita Singh, Prateek Sagar, and Anuj JhanwarÂ  The issue of GST rate rationalisation has been consistently addressed with the GST Council over the last six years. Various steps have been taken and issues discussed to streamline the process. It is well-known that the Fitment Committee has been working on rate rationalisation for various goods and services, including reviewing the option of a three-slab structure. Despite the complexities arising from multiple tax rate slabs, the measures undertaken aim to simplify the previously complex tax structure. The primary goal of rate rationalisation is not to increase government revenue but to streamline tax rates across sectors, thereby reducing the cascading effect of taxes and litigation related to tax classifications. Impact on Manufacturing and Compliance The manufacturing industry is broaching the subject of GST rationalisation with much fervour. The aim of the GST rate structure is to make tax systems simpler while at the same time keeping revenues neutral, which is not an easy task. In order to resolve classification challenges and relieve manufacturing sector from compliance strains, experts have proposed combining the 12% and 18% slabs and overhaul of the existing four-tiered GST rate structure of 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%. The present inverted duty structure where input rates exceed output rates has resulted to blockage of cash flow for various industries such as textile, solar, edible oils, etc. This will also address the issue of classification for availing a beneficial rate. In the past, Government has exempted GST on sanitary napkins as a rate rationalisation measure. As a result, the manufactures were denied the benefit of ITC which compelled the manufacturers to add the cost of ITC denied on raw materials to the price of final product, thereby increasing the market price of sanitary napkin. The overall impact of GST rate rationalisation on sanitary napkin remained ineffective. Challenges Faced by Different Sectors The insurance sector attracts a GST rate of 18% presently, the industry has been demanding reduction in tax rates, especially for health insurance services. Further, restaurant services attract GST @ 5% without any benefit of claiming Input Tax Credit (ITC). However, the restaurant sector has been demanding an optional structure for themselves that allow ITC with tax @12% on restaurant services. The real estate sector has encountered mixed effects from GST rate rationalisation. In the past, GST structure for construction services and related activities amended comprehensively. For residential properties, the rationalisation has resulted in lower GST rates, however, since ITC cannot be availed by this sector, the overall cost of housing becomes costlier. Further, cement which is a major component of the real estate sector is taxable at the highest rate of 28%, even in case of affordable schemes as well. Hence, the sector requires relief in this aspect. The tourism and hospitality sector seeks GST rate rationalisation to make the sector more affordable. GST rates on luxury hotels and high-end travel services is high as compared to other categories, which affect consumer demand in these segments. In pharmaceutical sector, various inputs used in preparing medications attract 18%, while the final product is in 5% tax slab. Similarly, electric vehicles is taxed at the rate of 5%, while its input involves range in the slab of 18-28%. Hence, GST Council may re-look at the GST rates where inverted duty scenarios arise. Separately, introducing ATF and natural gas within the ambit of GST, which is presently not leviable to GST, is also under pipeline. Presently, ITC of GST is not available and is added in the cost incurred by oil and gas companies. Balancing Sector-Specific Needs GST rate rationalisation has had a profound impact on various sectors, each adjusting to the new tax landscape in different ways. While many sectors benefit from the simplified tax structure and reduced rates, others face challenges related to compliance and transitional issues. Overall, the goal of GST rationalisation is to create a more transparent, efficient, and equitable tax environment, fostering economic growth and improving the business climate across India.

118,Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | Time for a reality check in equity markets?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-pro-panorama-time-for-a-reality-check-in-equity-markets-12815219.html,Economy,2024-09-05 15:25:00+05:30,"Dear Reader, The Panorama newsletter is sent to Moneycontrol Pro subscribers on market days. It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. This week saw the backlash of stock prices of two mega companies on the US bourses. One, the chip maker Nvidia, whose shares plunged by about 9.5 percent on Tuesday wiping out about $300 billion in a single day! Two, in a completely different industry segment, US Steel shares too tanked 25 percent, with trading briefly halted after news reports alleging that its $14.1 billion deal with Japan's Nippon Steel may be at risk. These are two of the most recent and glaring examples where mere whispers in investor circles -- not confirmed at times -- are sufficient to erase a lifetime of gains made in equity markets. There are numerous such instances in equity markets across countries, developed and emerging, where stock prices have crashed leaving investors in financial distress. And it is not always stock-specific debacles that investors have witnessed. At times, there is a market rout that put investors in a quandary (Japanese Yen carry trade, Middle-East conflict). In this context, it is perhaps time for a reality check in Indian equities, given the unabated rally. Driven by liquidity and unfettered by rising valuations, the Nifty 50 is holding up beyond 25,000 and the BSE Sensex above 82,000. Valuations are not reasonable. On the contrary, the price-to-earnings multiples are at a slight premium to the 10-year averages across segments -- large-cap, mid-cap and small-caps. This article highlights thatÂ all is not well in mid-caps.Â â€śA significant portion of the rally in mid-caps can be attributed to the substantial inflows of mid-cap, small-cap, and sectoral/thematic funds,â€ť it states. Besides, recent macroeconomic data have not been flattering. Q1 FY2025 gross domestic growth (GDP) faltered, so did the Purchasing Managersâ€™ Index for August, which slowed. At a micro level, the earnings growth for the quarter moderated on the back of a revenue slowdown. Several sectors such as auto, cement and conspicuous goods consumption portray moderation in growth. Indeed, the silver lining is softening inflation which is raising hopes of an interest rate cut sooner than later. For investors, the dilemma would be whether to opt for a paltry 6-7 percent return from secure fixed income or continue riding the bullish sentiment in equity markets till it lasts.

119,Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | IPO Frenzy: High demand but short-term gains predominate,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-pro-panorama-ipo-frenzy-high-demand-but-short-term-gains-predominate-12814276.html,Economy,2024-09-04 15:34:00+05:30,"Dear Reader,Â  The Panorama newsletter is sent to Moneycontrol Pro subscribers on market days. It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of.The gradual rise in Indian markets might not convey a sense of euphoria. The 14-day winning streak went largely unnoticed, except for a few headlines. The usual tell-tale signs, like market tips from your hairdresser or the shoe-shine boy, are absentâ€”likely because theyâ€™re busy investing in the primary market. According to a MoneycontrolÂ report, funds raised through Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) reached a 27-month high in August 2024. Ten firms collectively raised Rs 17,047.52 crore in the primary market, marking it the largestÂ fundraising since May 2022. Notably, three companies â€” Ola Electric Mobility, Brainbees Solutions, and Premier Energies â€”accounted for over 77 percentÂ of the funds raised. 2024 has been a strong year for IPOs, with 56 companies raising Rs 65,000 crore, a significant increase compared to the 20 IPOs that raised around Rs 15,051 crore during the first eight months of 2023. The details of these offerings give a glimpse of market euphoria. Approximately, 43 percent of the total funds â€” about Rs 7,333 crore â€” came from offers for sale (OFS), where private equity players and promoters partially cashed out during their companyâ€™s listing. With liquidity abundant and secondary market valuations high, investors are turning to the primary market for opportunities. Mutual funds, sitting on Rs 1.70 lakh crore of cash and waiting for a better time to invest, are finding the secondary market stubbornly resilient. With few alternatives, they are increasingly investing in IPOs. Retail investors are pouring into IPOs with renewed enthusiasm, both on the main board and in the SME segment. The high levels of oversubscription in most offerings highlight the intense demand for any company entering the market. An SME IPO from a bike dealer with just eight employees recently saw an astonishing 400 times oversubscription. In August, several main board issues were in high demand. Unicommerce eSolutions led the way with an oversubscription of 168.35 times, Orient Technologies at 155 times, and Saraswati Saree Depot at 108 times. Premier Energies, ECOS India Mobility and Hospitality, and Akums Drugs and Pharmaceuticals also received heavy subscriptions, of 75 times, 65 times, and 63 times, respectively. While demand for these IPOs is undeniably high, it doesnâ€™t necessarily indicate that investors see long-term value in these stocks. A SEBIÂ reportÂ reveals that most investors, including institutional ones, are only in for a quick profit. On average, around 54 percentÂ of IPO shares (by value) allocated to investors -- excluding anchor investors -- are sold within a week of listing. Although the typical exuberance of a bull market might be absent, the primary market is enjoying its own surge. Savvy investors are capitalising on market liquidity, swiftly booking profits and moving on to the next opportunity. This strategy works well â€” until the profits dry up and investors are left holding on to loss-making positions, waiting for the next bull market to bail them out.

120,India needs more small loans but not to households,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/india-needs-more-small-loans-but-not-to-households-12814012.html,Economy,2024-09-04 10:22:00+05:30,"Indians are justifiably proud of how easy it has become for them to pay for stuff. If you have an Indian phone number and bank account, instant digital transactions are fairly seamless. Now, the Reserve Bank of India wants to expand the countryâ€™s unified payments interface, or UPI, to lending: The central bankâ€™s governor has repeatedlypromisedÂ that a â€śunified lending interfaceâ€ť will soon be rolled out. That carries great potential â€” and not a little risk. Indiaâ€™s model for financial interconnectedness isÂ based aroundÂ what it calls â€śdigital public infrastructure.â€ť The idea is simple: The government, or a closely regulated quasi-public entity, invests in, manages, and pays for the system through which digital transactions take place. Businesses can create apps that use this infrastructure; interoperability is built in, so those apps must compete on cost and quality rather than on the size of their network. Consumers can decide how much of their information they are willing to share with specific apps or for specific transactions, and theoretically the sellerâ€™s access to private data is neither permanent nor very deep. The Indian IT whizzes who designed the system insist it avoids the worst of the US model (which is fragmented, insecure, and expensive), European systems (which are overregulated, lecture to business, and stifle innovation) and the Chinese network (which does not privilege privacy or allow for accountability to civil society). Quite a bit of information has been put on Indiaâ€™s UPI, fromÂ educationalÂ certificates andÂ medicalÂ history, to land records. Now that instant payments linked to bank accounts have been in use for years, thereâ€™s also a lot of financial data that could be put to work. At least, thatâ€™s what the RBI hopes. Its governorÂ arguedÂ that the availability of granular transfer data â€” as well as tax payments and land records â€” should make it easier for financial institutions to lend to farmers and small businesses that had previously struggled to access credit. That task has been a constant headache for Indiaâ€™s financial policymakers. The formal banking system is dominated by the public sector, which lacks much of a profit motive and thus has deeply conservative lending practices. When the government wants to juice lending, it creates schemes that target specific groups. Then the system switches to the other extreme, handing out cash to anyone and everyone without much discrimination. Thatâ€™sÂ risky. Meanwhile, the private sector naturally doesnâ€™t want to make the effort to enter a lending market dominated by borrowers with little access to collateral, minimal documentation, and few formal records. Now those same borrowers have a paper trail on the various digital platforms that the government secures. Even the amount of milk sold to various cooperatives by individual dairy farmers is on there somewhere. Getting that information to lenders in a way that incentivizes them to create a business model for small borrowers, while also protecting citizensâ€™ data, is the problem the central bank claims to have solved. The payoff could be vast. Indian small businesses typically do not grow larger â€” partly because of constraining regulation, but also because of differential access to credit. Indiaâ€™s unproductive agricultural sector, in particular, is short of capital investment and heavily dependent on public finance; it is both credit-hungry andÂ lacks avenuesÂ to access cash on demand. So, whatâ€™s the worry? Simply this: the potential impact on Indian household behavior. Throughout Indiaâ€™s modern economic history, household debt has been pretty low. Thatâ€™s slowly begun to change. According to the RBI, net household savings are at a 47-year low. In fact,Â they fellÂ by two whole percentage points of GDP just between 2022 and 2023. Indian households are stressed and borrowing more. The new system might make it much easier to take out collateral-free loans. The potential for this structural shift to become a macro risk is easy to see. That isnâ€™t enough of a reason to hold back financial innovation, especially if it might pay dividends in the longer term. But the government needs to be very watchful indeed for unintended consequences. India has long boasted that its growth model has been led by demand and consumption. If increased consumer spending winds up leading to unsustainable household borrowing patterns, the economy will be in real trouble. Credit: BloombergÂ  ",bank of india
121,The US Federal Reserve is containing Yuan bears. ThatŌĆÖs ironic,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/the-us-federal-reserve-is-containing-yuan-bears-thats-ironic-12814010.html,Economy,2024-09-04 10:04:00+05:30,"After a bruising few years, Asian currencies have suddenly becomeÂ fashionable again. But this enthusiasm is dependent onÂ words and deeds far away. The direction of global markets is driven overwhelmingly by the US. For now, that means interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Long depicted as Asiaâ€™s engine, Chinaâ€™s economic outlook is deteriorating, even as its currency is lifted by the tide generated in Washington. It would be imprudent to get too excited about Asiaâ€™s FX prospects without understanding the roots of the newfoundÂ positivity. The prospect of easing by the Fed, the most powerful central bank and guardian of the dollar, has pushed the greenback down â€”Â and counterparts up. The yenâ€™s rally, given an added boost from a recent surprise rate hike,Â hasÂ attracted the most attention. That seems only fair, given how beaten up Japan's exchange rate had been. The Thai baht and Indonesiaâ€™s rupiah have notched notable appreciations. Even the ringgit, whose lack of fans had frustrated officials in Kuala Lumpur, is having a strong run. Further afield, the Swiss franc and British pound are viewed more positively. ButÂ there may be an evenÂ more compelling story: the yuan. Gains by Chinaâ€™s currency have been such a relief for Beijing that the central bank hasÂ backed awayÂ from an important measure of support. The yuan has erasedÂ much of the year's lossesÂ versus the buck, and has strengthened toward the psychologically important level of 7 per dollar. So noteworthy has the shift been that the FX regulator has gone from striving to put a floor under the yuan to worrying about whether it will rise too far, too quickly. Official meddling in exchange rates is nothing new or unique to China. Tokyo intervened several times this year to stem the yen's decline, and for decades sought to curtail the opposite problem, that ofÂ itsÂ strength. China has exerted influence on a more granular basis. While the government ended a hard peg to the dollar in 2005, and gradually allowed greater daily moves, the People's Bank of China has kept it on a fairly tight leash. One of the main ways that officials can signal their desires is the so-called daily fixing. Fluctuations around that point are constrained. For the past year, the fix has focused on limiting losses, though stopping short of preventing them all together. Dollar sales by state-backedÂ banks were another prop. Late last month, things changed: The PBOC began setting its daily fix broadly in line with market expectations, according to Bloomberg News. A reasonable interpretation is that administrators are more comfortableÂ about where investors want to take the currency. With several rate cuts by the Fed penciled inÂ this year, its understandable traders are inclined to favour the yuan. What's more noteworthy is that this boomlet is happening as China's economic prospects turnÂ more bearish. Factory activityÂ contractedÂ for a fourth month in August, according to data released on Saturday. The woes of the residential property market were underscored a few hours earlier when China Vanke Co., a largeÂ developer, reported a half-year loss for the first time in decades. UBS Group AG recentlyÂ trimmedÂ its estimate for growth this year to 4.6%, down from an earlier prediction of 4.9%. These numbersÂ suggest waning confidence that the government will meet its target of an expansion in gross domestic product of around 5% this year. Perhaps China should consider scrapping such numerical targets; they create a sometimes unrealistic benchmark by which the economy is measured. No doubt, China is enduring a difficult stretch. Is it too simplistic to pin the yuan's modest recovery, and the broader regional rebound, on the Fed? Most commentary points toÂ Chair Jerome Powell'sÂ speechÂ at Jackson Hole late last month when he said the time for rate cuts has arrived. (One prominent yen bull, Macquarie Group Ltd., said the Japanese currencyâ€™sÂ rally was due almost entirely to Jackson Hole.) Another Fed event may not have beenÂ given sufficient attention: On July 31, at the conclusion of the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting, the central bank's statement â€”Â and Powell, at his press conference â€”Â left little doubtÂ cuts were approaching. This was, arguably, the true pivot. China has long sought to simultaneously contain yuan bears and promote use of the yuan as a global currency. How ironic that all it takes a few words from the US central bank to achieve the former. It shows how far China is fromÂ being successful in its campaign to erode dollar hegemony in any meaningful way. For now, it's Planet Fed. Talk about frenemies. Credit: BloombergÂ  ",NA
122,Wall Street strategists face their own short squeeze,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/wall-street-strategists-face-their-own-short-squeeze-12813568.html,Economy,2024-09-03 16:45:00+05:30,"Since the pandemic, Wall Street strategists have repeatedly underestimated the performance of the US stock market in their annual projections, leading to a mad dash to boost their outlooks inÂ the back end of the year. The flurry of upward revisions can look something like a â€śshort squeeze,â€ť which is a situation where traders are forced to cover bearish bets in quick succession, often reinforcingÂ a securityâ€™s upward momentum. In that sense, this year has already seen the biggest short squeeze among strategists in a decade, and seasonal trends suggest itâ€™s poised to continue in coming months. In general, such price targets have always had a spotty record, but this market has proved particularly difficult for strategists to process. First, the outperformance of large-cap growth companies has broken traditional models meant to translate macroeconomic conditions and interest rates into fair values for the S&P 500 Index. Just five companies â€” Nvidia Corp, Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com Inc â€” explain almostÂ half the benchmarkâ€™s performance since early 2020, which means that macro models are insufficient if they fail to account for their idiosyncratic stories, including the artificial intelligence theme. Though some stocks have benefitted from rising price-earnings multiples, itâ€™s mostly been the underlying surge in revenues and profits that have powered them higher. At a minimum, every strategist should be having lunch with aÂ Nvidia analyst a few times a quarter. Second, economists and strategists have consistently misjudged the strength of the economy. At the start of 2023, the median estimate showed economists surveyed by Bloomberg thought the US would barely muddle through the year. Instead, it grew 2.5% and looks poised to do so again this year. Much of the forecast error was probably an over-reliance on old rules of thumb, including the idea that Federal Reserve interest-rate increasesÂ typically lead to economic downturns. That may be true in â€śnormalâ€ť economic cycles, but not after a pandemic when employers are hoarding labor, consumers are desperate to get back into restaurants and concerts and the typical homeowner has a 3% mortgage rate and is swimming in home equity. Economists may have also underestimated the macroeconomic impacts of capital expenditures from the AIÂ arms race along withÂ President Joe Bidenâ€™s industrial policies. And yet the average strategist surveyed by Bloomberg still sees the S&P 500, which closed last week atÂ 5,648,Â falling about 3% to end the year at 5,469 (median: 5,600; range: 4,200-6,000). Thatâ€™s perplexingÂ because many pieces of that 2023-2024 story remain broadly intact, supported by real-time data. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlantaâ€™s GDPNow model suggests the economy is currently growing at a 2.5% annualized rate. About 81% of S&P 500 companies have beaten Wall Street estimates in the current earnings season, including consumer bellwethers Target Corp and Walmart Inc. And longer-term borrowing costs have begun to plummet in advance of expected FedÂ rate cuts likely to begin in September. Initial jobless claims show layoffs arenâ€™t getting out of hand, and the recent slump in AI chipmaker Nvidia (known to some asÂ the most important stock on the planet) has been more about company-specific production snags, rather than the long-term promise of AI. Meanwhile, the marketâ€™s supporting cast looks to beÂ hitting its stride. Excluding the top five stocks, earnings growth for members of the S&P 500 is projected to accelerate through 2025. Of course, the S&P 500 is trading at 21.3Â times blended forward earning, which is on the high side of history. That shouldnâ€™t be handwaved away even if itâ€™s largely a reflection of the indexâ€™s changing composition. Yet high valuations reinforced by fundamentals and great stories can stay high for sustained periods of time. And with another strategist short squeeze seemingly in the offing this autumn and winter, itâ€™s much harder to imagine that a reckoning is close at hand. Credit: BloombergÂ  ",NA
123,Rate cuts may be round the corner as economic growth drivers are losing momentum,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/rate-cuts-may-be-round-the-corner-as-economic-growth-drivers-are-losing-momentum-12813392.html,Economy,2024-09-03 15:12:00+05:30,"ByÂ Aurodeep NandiÂ  Is Indiaâ€™s growth picking up or slowing down? Simple question but complicated answer. On the one hand, GDP growth fell to 6.7 percent year-on-year (y-o-y) in the first quarter, Q1 FY25, from 7.8 percent in Q4 FY24. It was below expectations of 6.8 percent. On the other hand, gross value added (GVA) growth rose to 6.8 percent from 6.3 percent, above market expectations (6.4 percent). Riddle me this! GVA-GDPâ€™s changing dynamics The past three quarters have witnessed this play out in reverse. GDP growth soared, while GVA growth wilted, making for a messy growth outlook. GDP is equal to GVA + (indirect taxes - subsidies). So, GVA growth exceeding GDP suggests lower indirect taxes and/or higher subsidies outgo. We also note that GDP growth tends to undershoot GVA growth during economic slowdowns, due to lower net indirect taxes. In our view, GVA growth exceeding that of GDP cannot be ruled out in coming quarters.  GDPâ€™s drivers So what has driven growth in Q1 FY25? On the GDP side, the growth moderation was primarily owing to a contraction in government consumption by -0.2 percent y-o-y, despite a favourable base, underlining the election-led dip in government spending. The sharp rise in private consumption growth to 7.4 percent y-o-y from 4 percent in Q4 FY24 and a near two-year high is surprising, considering the heatwave should have had a negative impact. Fixed investment also maintained robust growth of 7.5 percent from 6.5 percent in the prior quarter, despite monthly fiscal data suggesting a fall in public capex growth. This suggests private investment picked up, likely led by housing. Strong export growth and weak import growth led to net exportsâ€™ contribution rising.  GVA drivers On the supply side, agricultural GVA growth remained weak at 2 percent y-o-y in Q1 FY25 from 0.6 percent in Q4 FY24, reflecting weaker rabi crop production. Industrial GVA growth moderated to a still-elevated 7.4 percent from 8.3 percent in the previous quarter, reflecting strong growth in utilities and mining, and some moderation in manufacturing growth. That said, we had expected a bigger drop in growth, owing to muted corporate profits. Services GVA growth rose to 7.7 percent from 7 percent, with solid performance across construction, public administration (despite lower government spending), and the financial, real estate & professional services sectors. By contrast, growth in the labour-intensive â€śtrade, hotels, transport and communicationâ€ť sector remained weak at 5.7 percent y-o-y versus 5.1 percent, possibly reflecting tepid domestic demand. What lies ahead That said, where is growth headed hereon? Early data for Q2 FY25 suggest a mixed start. Among the consumption indicators, passenger vehicles and MHCV sales have underwhelmed and the trends are likely to broadly continue into August. Meanwhile, two-wheeler and tractor sales are performing comparatively better, reflecting a gradually recovering rural economy amid robust rainfall. Air travel and cargo traffic growth have been healthy. As India enters the festive months from September onwards, we will monitor whether sales this year improve from last yearâ€™s levels. Of the investment/industrial indicators available thus far in the current quarter, steel, cement, and electricity production have eased on a sequential basis, although y-o-y growth rates have picked up. July trade statistics also point towards falling industrial import growth. Meanwhile, merchandise export growth continued to contract in July, even as services exports have been healthy. Fiscal data for July suggest that following a sharp slump in public capex growth in the past two months, it has picked up in July. However, revenue expenditure growth has fallen, underlining the governmentâ€™s struggle to revive government spending. With sub-7 percent GDP growth in the first quarter of the fiscal year, and a mixed start to the second, we lower our GDP growth forecast to 6.7 percent y-o-y in FY25 from 6.9 percent previously. The slump in government spending should reverse and the mix of good monsoons, and lower inflation bodes well for the rural economy. This, along with stable public and household investment, stable global growth and ebullience in parts of the services sector continue to propel growth in India. Weakness in sources of aggregate demand On the flip side, cracks are emerging in urban demand, and despite its revival, rural terms of trade remains low by historical standards and real rural wage growth continues to contract. The continued weakness in the labour-intensive trade, hotels, transportation and communication component of the GVA is concerning. In addition, while corporate investment improved in FY24, it has been a sober recovery and a strong upswing is still pending, despite cleaner balance sheets. As the benefits of sharp input cost disinflation fades, so will likely terms-of-trade tailwinds for corporates, resulting in lower corporate profits. We also expect the RBIâ€™s tighter macroprudential measures to result in a slowdown in credit growth. That said, Indiaâ€™s strong medium-term growth drivers, robust fundamentals and continued reforms should ensure GDP growth of ~7 percent (FY25: 6.7 percent; FY26: 7.2 percent), although we see rising downside risks for FY26 as well. RBI may ease monetary stance How will the RBI react? GDP growth of 6.7 percent is 0.4 percentage point lower than the RBI's forecast of 7.1 percent, so this is a dovish outturn. We expect the RBI to lower its FY25 GDP growth projection of 7.2 percent by at least 0.1 percent at the October meeting. Thus far the RBI has downplayed softer GVA trends, and focused on GDP growth numbers to flag growth resilience. Consequently, the faster rise in GVA growth should not be of much consequence. We continue to expect a policy pivot coming up. The RBI has thus far maintained a hawkish drumbeat, emphasizing the potential generalization of higher food inflation and the policy space awarded by the robust growth outlook. This has effectively ruled out consensus expectations of any easing in policy rates in the near term. However, we differ in our assessment. Underlying inflationary pressures are muted, growth is softening, the global rates cycle is pivoting, and the RBI doesnâ€™t provide any forward guidance. We expect the RBI to deliver the first cut in October, ahead of consensus expectations of December or later, with 100 basis points of cumulative easing in FY25.

It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. Shares of Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) gained 3 percent in Tuesday trade after the government approved procurement of aircraft engines from the┬Ācompany for Rs 26,000 crore. The latest orders will send the companyŌĆÖs order book to well above Rs 1 lakh crore, a remarkable rise from Rs 58,588 crore order backlog in March 2019. At the beginning of the current fiscal, HAL has indicated prospective orders of Rs 47,000 crore in manufacturing and Rs 20,000 crore in repair and overhaul (services). The latest order places the company well on track to achieve order inflow guidance. HAL received the Rs 26,000 crore engines order as part of the ŌĆśBuy IndianŌĆÖ programme of the government. The engines will have indigenous content of over 54 percent. The governmentŌĆÖs continuous focus on indigenisation and the┬Āprospect of large orders┬Āhave driven up shares of other defence PSUs also. Business opportunities or order pipeline for HAL is pegged at Rs 1.5 lakh crore over the next 2-3 years. The current order backlog of around Rs 1 lakh crore is about three times FY24 sales and provides revenue visibility for HAL. Even so, investors should also give due importance to execution and not just orders. Despite a notable rise in order inflows in FY19 to FY24, compound annual sales of HAL increased by less than 8 percent. Sales at peer Bharat Electronics rose by more than 10 percent per annum during the period. Bharat Electronics outperformed HAL on revenue growth between FY14 and FY24 also. HAL has guided for double-digit growth or at least 10 percent expansion in sales in FY25 and exuded confidence of maintaining growth rates in the next couple of years. Still, the low double-digit revenue growth target is a low bar for the HAL stock that is trading at 37 times estimated FY26 earnings. A case in point is the light combat aircraft Mk1A. Execution of this large order is delayed due to supply chain issues at engines supplier GE Aerospace. This can impact delivery of the light combat aircraft in FY25 and revenue recognition of the contract. ŌĆ£Our channel checks indicate that the delay in delivery is due to adverse impact on the supply of engines by GE owing to global supply chain disruption,ŌĆØ analysts at ICICI Securities said in a note. As HAL executes multiple large orders, it should increase its focus on project execution. Minimal delays and timely revenue recognition will go a long way in generating shareholder returns in the long run.

125,IndiaŌĆÖs shortage of deposits has a taste of ChinaŌĆÖs past,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/indias-shortage-of-deposits-has-a-taste-of-chinas-past-12813191.html,Economy,2024-09-03 12:15:00+05:30,"A shortage of deposits is starting to unnerve IndiaŌĆÖs bankers and policymakers.┬ĀThe lendersŌĆÖ worry is more understandable than the authoritiesŌĆÖ. Taking a leaf from a two-decade-old Chinese playbook, the central bank is reining in money growth to tame inflation. In the process, though, itŌĆÖs putting up a new hurdle in the way of┬Ācredit and investment. Separately, the government is making the deposit crunch worse by taxing savers aggressively, but keeping the proceeds away from┬Āthe financial┬Āsystem. Bankers are compounding the problem┬Āby not paying enough to┬Āsavers. Yet itŌĆÖs the lendersŌĆÖ behaviour being put┬Āunder the scanner.┬ĀThe finance ministry┬Āwants depository institutions┬Āto undertake special drives┬Āto mobilize household savings, while the Reserve Bank of India has warned them that theyŌĆÖre potentially skirting with┬ĀŌĆ£structural liquidity issues.ŌĆØ┬ĀOne of them seems to be technology. The RBI wants┬Ābanks to assume that any customer account connected to a smartphone is prone to┬Āfaster erosion of deposits. From next year, banks in India will have to hold more┬Āsafe assets like cash and government securities to┬Āmeet the risk of runoff┬Āfrom internet-enabled accounts. While this could slow system-wide credit, some individual lenders will have to do more to get out of their liquidity squeeze. HDFC Bank Ltd., the largest non-state bank, is planning to sell┬Ā100 billion rupees ($1.2 billion)┬Āof its advances to lower its loans-to-deposit ratio, which has exceeded┬Ā100 percent for four straight quarters, according to Bloomberg data. More than technology, the RBI is worried about greed. For a little over┬Ātwo years, credit has grown┬Āfaster than deposits. Retail interest in the stock market has exploded in this period. Households that ŌĆ£traditionally leaned on banks for parking or investing their savings are increasingly turning to capital markets and other financial intermediaries,ŌĆØ┬ĀRBI Governor Shaktikanta Das┬Āsaid┬Āin July. That explanation doesnŌĆÖt wash. After all, if┬Āthe asset buyerŌĆÖs bank balance┬Āis┬Ādebited to pay for securities, the sellerŌĆÖs account┬Āis credited. The┬Āpie┬Āmay get redistributed among┬Ālenders, and its composition┬Āmay change. Still, money┬ĀwonŌĆÖt leave the system, except at ATMs, and┬Āthe use of cash in transactions is slowing. Loans create their own deposits. A┬Ānew mortgage will eventually show up as a credit entry┬Āin the┬Āproperty sellerŌĆÖs account. Sure, loans for foreign education ŌĆö or buy-now-pay-later credit used to buy imported goods ŌĆö will leak from the local banking system. But that wonŌĆÖt cause a persistent deposit shortfall. A┬Ābigger drain┬Āis more likely taking place via taxes, which are sitting in the governmentŌĆÖs account with the central bank. That┬Āis why state-run lenders are asking New Delhi┬Āto┬Āpark┬Āits cash balances with them, instead of the monetary authority. Where the RBI may have played a role in the deposit shortage is in slowing down its printing presses. The sum total of its liabilities ŌĆö┬Ācurrency held by the public, and reserves that banks keep in their current accounts with the monetary authority┬ĀŌĆö grew 2.3 percentage points slower than the┬Ā9.7 percent expansion in nominal gross domestic product┬Āin the June quarter. Last month, the pace of money creation┬Ācrashed to under 4 percent. This is odd. The central bankŌĆÖs monetary base, also called high-powered money because┬Āit fuels credit, tends to run ahead of GDP growth. (The two┬Ābig exceptions in recent years were┬Āduring the 2013 taper tantrum and in the aftermath of┬Āthe sudden┬Ā2016 ban on 86 percent of the currency.) In China, a squeeze on the monetary base┬Āused to be a feature of economic management, rather than a bug. The┬Āinvestment boom after BeijingŌĆÖs 2001 accession to the World Trade Organization could┬Āhave been exhausting, turning the current account, which represents the excess of domestic savings over local investment, into deficit. Yet┬ĀChina kept racking up higher surpluses. In a 2007┬Āstudy, Michael Mussa, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, said the clue to the puzzle lay┬Āin the central bankŌĆÖs balance sheet. Central banks in developed countries with┬Āfloating exchange rates buy government securities┬Āto print new money. Since having too much of it around┬Āis inflationary,┬Āinterest rates have to rise to cool demand.┬ĀBut China wanted to run its economy red-hot, with an undervalued currency giving it an edge in export markets. So instead of buying bonds, the PeopleŌĆÖs Bank of China scooped up incoming┬Ādollars. And since buying dollars from banks left them with more yuan, the PBOC┬Āthen mopped up some of that liquidity. By keeping a tight rein on the monetary base, especially between 2004 and 2006, the PBOC┬Ādenied households the purchasing power that ought to┬Āhave resulted from┬Ārapid economic growth, forcing them to save more at low, state-controlled deposit interest rates. By engineering a rise in national thrift, China managed to self-finance its growing hunger for investments. Could India be┬Āpursuing a similar approach? ItŌĆÖs no secret that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is aiming to put the┬Āeconomy on an investment-led path of┬Āgrowth with Chinese characteristics. Private final consumption expenditure nowadays accounts for┬Ā60 percent of IndiaŌĆÖs GDP. That number used to be┬Āalmost 80 percent half a century ago. The investment rate, however, is still at about┬Ā31 percent of output. Never mind the┬Ā45 percent rate at which capital formation in China┬Āpeaked in 2013. Can Modi┬Āraise the investment-to-GDP ratio┬Āto┬Ā36 percent, the high achieved by India before the Global Financial Crisis of 2008-09? Even the recovery from that shock ended abruptly in 2013 as┬Ādomestic savings ran out, and foreigners balked from financing the countryŌĆÖs high current-account deficits. Since then, the current account has been well behaved, and unlike a decade ago, banks are well capitalized. This time around,┬Āthe vulnerability may be building elsewhere. ItŌĆÖs the lendersŌĆÖ┬Ādeposit shortage that could put a speed limit on credit-fueled investment┬ĀŌĆö┬Āunless authorities┬Ācome up with some ingenious ways to keep banks lubricated while putting┬Āa lid on money creation.

The World Bank expects India's medium term outlook to remain positive. Growth is estimated to remain strong in FY26 and FY27. With robust revenue growth and further fiscal consolidation, the debt to GDP ratio is projected to decline from 83.9 percent in FY24 to 82 percent by FY27. The current account deficit is expected to remain at 1-1.6 percent of GDP up to FY27, the World Bankâ€™s latest India Development Update stated. India was the fastest growing economy in FY24 at 8.2 percent and now it's growing at a good pace, Auguste Tano Kouame, Country Director for India said at the launch of the World Bank report. Global growth is projected to remain muted compared to pre-pandemic levels, Kouame added. The World Bank report highlighted improvement in headline inflation in FY24. Central level consolidation contributed to narrowing fiscal deficit in FY24, it noted. The report said that India's urban employment has improved since the pandemic, especially for female workers. Boosting India's exports ""India needs to diversify its export basket and leverage global value chains to reach $1 tn merchandise exports by 2030,"" Kouame further added. ""India has had a proactive approach to free trade agreements. But it is important for India to have comprehensive FTAs to include digital trade. Post pandemic reconfiguration of global value chains has created opportunities for India,"" Kouame said.India has boosted its competitiveness through National Logistics policy and digital initiatives that are reducing trade costs. However, tariff and non-tariff barriers have increased and could limit potential for trade focused investments, the report highlighted. ""India's robust growth prospects along with declining inflation will help to reduce extreme poverty. India can boost its growth further by harnessing its global trade potential. In addition to IT, business services and pharma where it excels, India can diversify its export basket with increased exports in textiles, apparel, footwear, electronics and green technology,"" Kouame added. The World Bank report recommends a three-pronged approach towards achieving the $1 tn merchandise export target by reducing trade costs, lowering trade barriers and deepening trade integration. ""With rising costs of production and declining productivity, India's share in global apparel exports has declined from 4 percent in 2018 to 3 percent in 2022. To create more trade related jobs, India can integrate more deeply into global value chains which will also create opportunities for innovation and productivity growth,â€ť Nora Dihel and Ran Li, Senior Economists, co-authors of World Bank report said.

Addressing the 10th Interpol Liaison Officers (ILOŌĆÖs) Conference, organized by the CBI, Sood said as many as 29 wanted criminals were brought back to India in 2023 and 19 so far in 2024 with the help of Interpol and international law enforcement partners. He said Global Operation Centre of CBI has handled 17,368 international assistance requests in 2023. Home Secretary Govind Mohan also lauded the Global Operation Centre of CBI, underlining that the centre is handling 200-300 requests for assistance including both incoming and outgoing on daily basis. In his address, Sood said as many as 100 Red Notices were issued by Interpol on criminals and fugitives wanted by Indian law enforcement agencies, the highest ever in a year.

130,Haryanaâ€™s election heads for a bipolar face-off,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/haryanas-election-heads-for-a-bipolar-face-off-12815242.html,Politics,2024-09-05 14:55:00+05:30,"In the past decade, Haryana's political landscape has shifted dramatically. Once a minor player, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has transformed into a dominant force, while the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), formerly a major player, now finds itself marginalised. The Jannayak Janata Party (JJP), a recent offshoot of the INLD, faces decline with seven of its ten MLAs recently defecting. And the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has been a negligible presence in Haryana since its inception in 2014. Other smaller parties like the Azad Samaj Party (ASP), Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP), and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) are pretty much like the popularÂ â€˜Aya Ram, Gaya Ramâ€™Â proverb popularised in Haryana politics in the 1960s. Jats and others As the 2024 Haryana Assembly elections approach, scheduled for October 5, the focus is squarely on the two major contenders: The Indian National Congress (INC) and the BJP. Congress aims to consolidate the Jat vote, which makes up about 25 percent of the stateâ€™s population, while leveraging a decade of anti-incumbency sentiment against the BJP. In contrast, the BJP is working to bring OBCs and other castes under one umbrella, hoping to secure a third consecutive term. OBCs constitute a significant 36 percent of Haryana's population, though they have historically not voted as a cohesive bloc. To address this, the BJP appointed Nayab Singh Saini, an OBC, as the chief minister of the state in March this year. If BJP succeeds, it will have successfully replicated Kanshi Ramâ€™s caste-politics formula in Haryana which essentially means to mobilise the marginalised majority (Bahujan) to achieve political power. Numbers do not tell the whole story However, to achieve this, BJP has to overcome a challenge. Like in neighbouring Punjab, in Haryana the marginalised voters for economic reasons are tethered to the landing-holding Jat community. They work in their farms and get their fair share when the crop is harvested. Thus the political influence the Jats wield in this state is way more than their population. And to helm the Congress campaign there are many Jat leaders like the two-time chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Randeep Surjewala, Birender Singh, and others. Main issues: Crime, unemployment, inflation One of the biggest issues in Haryana is the sudden rise in extortion and murder cases in the last year. Recent incidents include the February 25 killing of INLD state chief Nafe Singh Rathee, the March 10 murder of liquor trader Sunder Malik near Murthal in Sonepat, a ransom demand ofÂ Rs 5 crore from INLDâ€™s Ram Bhagat Gupta by firing shots outside his Mahindra showroom in Hisar on June 24. In yet another incident, a 35-year-old Gurugram-based businessman was gunned down at a hotel near Lakhan Majra town in Rohtak on February 28. Most of these ransom calls were made from abroad. Unemployment is another major issue in Haryana. Youngsters for want of jobs are opting to go abroad, particularly from Karnal, Kurukshetra, Ladwa and Kaithal. Like Punjab, many IELTS institutes have popped up in the state in the last five years selling dreams of opportunities abroad. And pinching the pocket of the common man is the inflation rate in Haryana. Until October 2023, Haryana along with Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh was among the only states with higher retail inflation figures than the national average every month.Â This year it has slightly improved. Also, the impact of the 2020-2021 anti-farm bill protests still resonates among rural voters, particularly Jats and Ahirwals, and not to forget the wrestlers' protest at the Jantar Mantar which was spearheaded by Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik. TheÂ Congress party has boosted its campaign by signalling that Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia will be party candidates from Julana and Badli assembly seats respectively in the upcoming polls. Given the current political landscape, both the BJP and Congress are adopting distinct strategies to sway voters. The BJP is focusing on the benefits of its ""double-engine"" governance, showcasing Prime Minister Narendra Modiâ€™s accomplishments of infrastructural development projects and national security. Their campaign portrays them as the party best equipped to tackle these issues, appealing to voters who prioritise strong leadership and security. However, in rural areas, the BJP is facing significant challenges in persuading voters to support them. In contrast, Congress is highlighting unresolved issues such as rising crime, unemployment, farmers' distress, and inflation while criticising the BJP's decade-long rule. To enhance its electoral chances and challenge the BJP's dominance, Congress is considering an alliance with the AAP. The party is actively conducting door-to-door campaigns and public rallies to connect with voters with the slogan HaryanaÂ maange hisab.

131,Rise of extremism gives Germanyâ€™s leaders another wake-up call Â ,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/rise-of-extremism-gives-germanys-leaders-another-wake-up-call-12815085.html,Politics,2024-09-05 15:41:00+05:30,"Germanyâ€™s centrist leaders must heed the message that voters keep sending them: If they want to avert a descent into extremism, they need to offer a much bolder vision for the country. The latest wake-up call came from elections in the eastern states of Saxony and Thuringia, the latter of which the far-right Alternative for Germany won outright â€” a troubling post-war first for a party whose local leader has used banned Nazi slogans in speeches. More telling, though, was the suddenÂ successÂ of the far-left SahraÂ Wagenknecht Alliance, launched only in January to ride the same wave of popular discontent that has fueled the AfDâ€™s rise. The result suggests that voters are simply fed up with the status quo, not longing for the fascist past. Their dissatisfaction is understandable. Just a decade ago, Germany was in the European vanguard. Its export-oriented economic modelÂ deliveredÂ impressive growth. Its efforts to combat climate change led the world. When then-Chancellor Angela Merkel made the monumental (and controversial) decision to welcome almost a million mainly Syrian refugees, her promise that â€śweâ€™ll manage thisâ€ť was believable. Now the economy is in the doldrums â€” thanks in part to a war-related energy-price shock and growing competition from China, butÂ alsoÂ to abundant red tape and a long-running lack of public investment in infrastructure. National champion Volkswagen AG is considering the first German plant closures in its 87-year history. Trains donâ€™t run onÂ time. On the green front, ham-handed efforts to promote everything from heat pumps to ecologically friendly farming have stoked anger among homeowners and farmers alike. DespiteÂ progressÂ in integrating refugees, people increasingly see immigration as a problem â€” a situation worsened by a recent spate of violent crimes allegedlyÂ committedÂ by foreigners.  Germanyâ€™s mainstream parties need to unite around a plan to break out of the malaise and convince voters that theyâ€™re capable of following through. This should include a new economic model focused on investing in productivity, unleashing domestic demand and attracting private capital. It requires bringing a burdensome and unduly paper-based bureaucracy into the 21st century. And it entails making the case for immigrants â€” desperately needed to bolster an aging labor force â€” to a skeptical populace. The current ruling coalition â€” an uneasy mix of Chancellor Olaf Scholzâ€™s center-left Social Democrats, Finance Minister Christian Lindnerâ€™s center-right Free Democrats and Economy Minister Robert Habeckâ€™s Greens â€” hasnâ€™t proven up to the task. Although theyâ€™ve laid outÂ plansÂ to revive growth, they canâ€™t even agree on a fiscal policy that would allow for the necessary public investment. Scholz has been making tactical sops to extremists, such as tightening asylum requirements and limiting support for Ukraine. So far, mainstream partiesâ€™ refusal to cooperate with the AfD will probably keep it out of power in Thuringia. The same might happen at the next federal elections, scheduled for September 2025. But such firewalls â€” or an outright ban of the AfD, as some have proposed â€” wonâ€™t stop the rot. If centrists want to win the country back from the extremists, theyâ€™ll have to come up with something more inspiring. Credit: BloombergÂ  ",NA

Although their estimates diverged substantially in June and July, they mostly converged in August and showed Trump at a substantial disadvantage by mid-month. In the last week, Silver is showing a Trump comeback that bettors donâ€™t buy. Forecasters and prediction markets haveÂ well-known systematic errors. Itâ€™s possible to adjust for these and combine the information from Silverâ€™s modeling and the wisdom of crowds betting real money to get a superior estimate. The problem is similar to a jury hearing testimony from two witnesses â€” each with known biases. You think both are basically truthful, but one is a friend of the defendant and will shade testimony to protect her friend. The other is at risk of being charged in related offenses and will shade testimony so he appears more innocent. Neither is entirely consistent, and the two conflict on some points. You try to remove the biases from each witnessâ€™ testimony, then find the version of the truth most consistent with the two adjusted stories. This version could be radically different and is not necessarily the truth. It only represents your best judgment about what their evidence means for the case. Similarly, Iâ€™m not trying to consider all the evidence for election probabilities, only to interpret what Silverâ€™s predictions and PredictItâ€™s prices tell us. For impatient readers, Iâ€™ll jump to the end with my â€śfilteringâ€ť (the mathematical term for estimating an underlying signal from multiple reports contaminated with different forms of noise) of the election probability. It shows Trump entering the summer with a strong lead, but gradually losing ground until the debate with President Joe Biden on June 27 turned things around. Trump continued to gain as Biden first remained in the race, then dropped out. Starting in late July, we see a crash in Trumpâ€™s chances that was dubbed Kamalamania by the press. The Democratic party and its major donors rallied smoothly behind Harris, and various imagined hurdles to replacing Biden evaporated. Trump, however, weathered the storm without ever becoming an underdog, and now seems to hold about a 70 percent win probability, the highest aside from a brief peak immediately after Biden dropped out. Remember, I donâ€™t claim these are the true probabilities, only what Silver and PredictIt are telling us, if we interpret them properly. Put another way, if no news came out for a couple of weeks, Silver and PredictIt would converge to near the current filtered estimate of 70 percent. We should take that seriously â€” Silver is a smart guy with an impressive track record, and markets can harness the wisdom of crowds, but neither is infallible. My filtering resembles Silverâ€™s numbers, moved a little in the direction of PredictItâ€™sÂ until the beginning of Kamalamania. At that point, the numbers suggest Silver and PredictIt suffered â€śflash crashes.â€ť Both models have strong momentum components that are normally balanced by mean reversion. But when a large sudden move occurs, both are overwhelmed by momentum and exaggerate the crash, like panicked investors fleeing a falling market. My filtering shows a 20 percent gain for Harris from Kamalamania, while Silver sees 26 percent and PredictIt shows 31 percent. The filtered model follows Silverâ€™s estimate of Trumpâ€™s recovery from his low, but PredictIt thinks Trump clawed back only $0.05 versus Silverâ€™s 14 percent estimate. What do I mean by momentum? Silverâ€™s forecasts move an average of 0.19 percent each day in the same direction as the previous dayâ€™s move â€” thatâ€™s out of a 0.96 percent average daily absolute move. Roughly 20 percent of the information in his forecast is based on stale rather than new information. PredictIt prices also move, on average, in the same direction as the previous dayâ€™s move. My filtering estimates the amount of momentum and other flaws in the forecasts that I discuss later and backs them out to derive the underlying signal. Experts build momentum into their forecasts to appear more confident. True probabilities are random walks, like a drunkardâ€™s meandering, and are hard to explain. Adding momentum creates trends, like a sober person walking home, making for simpler stories. Hedge fund managers and especially private equity managers do the same thing, smoothing the ups and downs of returns to make their performance seem steadier, with more skill and less luck. Betting and financial markets have momentum for different reasons. First, information leaks slowly into prices. Second, bettors and traders are apt to treat favourable price movements as validation, a reason to increase bets, rather than as less attractive betting opportunities. By itself, momentum has the potential to drive prices to extremes. Betting and financial markets tend to offset this with longer-term mean reversion. In the case of PredictIt, the model moves every day 2 percent closer to a $0.48 price for Trump. This represents a medium-term value anchor for bettors. But Silver, like most experts, does the opposite. Every day he moves 2 percent away from the value anchor of 48 percent. Experts who predict what everyone else expects get no respect. By exaggerating their differences, they get more attention and rewards. The next points are features, not bugs. Silverâ€™s forecasts move 9 percent of the way toward PredictItâ€™s prices every day, and PredictIt prices move 4 percent of the way toward Silverâ€™s. I donâ€™t mean Silver is watching the PredictIt site and mechanically adjusting forecasts. He could be doing that, or using prediction market data in general, or looking at the same factors that drive bettor behaviour. PredictIt bettors could be reading Silver, or reacting to the same information that influences him. Either way, adjusting for these tendencies helps the filter combine the information in the two forecasts. PredictIt anticipates Silverâ€™s momentum. Its prices move toward Silverâ€™s forecasts augmented by the average momentum. So, if Silver says Trumpâ€™s chances moved from 60 percent to 61 percent, PredictIt bettors seem to treat that as a move to 61.19 percent, since we expect Silver to add another 0.19 percent tomorrow if there is no news. Silver does the opposite, treating PredictItâ€™s momentum as overreaction to be subtracted. He subtracts 0.12 times PredictItâ€™s move from yesterday to today. So, if PredictIt goes from $0.60 to $0.61, Silver treats it as a rise to $0.6088. Many people,Â including me, have griped about these flaws since 2016 when interest in presidential election forecasts took off â€” and accuracy took a nosedive.Â It's always puzzled me why Silver, a top poker player and serious quant, would allow momentum and mean avoidance into his forecasts â€” especially in the face of widespread criticism. I just finished his new book,Â On the EdgeÂ (which I recommend highly), and it may hold the key. To an extent thatâ€™s hard to understand, Silver is frustrated by uninformed criticism of his probabilistic forecasts. It reminds me of Cliff Asness, co-founder of AQR Capital Management, where I worked for 10 years. He was once railing about how crazy and irrational the market was, when his wife Laurel asked, â€śDonâ€™t you make your money betting against crazy?â€ť Youâ€™d think Cliff and Silver would smile with quiet satisfaction at people misunderstanding probability â€” like hearing someone at a poker table saying, â€śI never fold if thereâ€™s any card in the deck that could make my hand.â€ť What do I think is the actual probability that Trump will win? The filtered version of Silver and PredictItâ€™s information â€” what I think is the most likely underlying reality behind both their predictions â€” indicates 70 percent, which should carry a lot of weight. But I think forecasts and prices have bounced around too much this summer given both the chaos in the race and the amount of electioneering still to come. I donâ€™t believe Kamalamania created a 20 percent or greater change in probabilities. A 20 percent change is a big deal. In last yearâ€™s World Series, the single most consequential play, a one-out, two-run homer in the bottom of the ninth by Corey Seager to tie the game, increased the Rangersâ€™Â chance of winning the series by less than 15 percent. I donâ€™t see early August events as Trump throwing or Harris hitting a two-run, bottom of the ninth homer to tie the game. Thereâ€™s a lot of campaigning to go, a lot of events that could turn the election into a landslide for either candidate. If nothing much happens, the result could turn on a handful of Pennsylvania voters who are on the fence about voting, or on the fence between Trump and Harris, who likely arenâ€™t following the news much and wonâ€™t make up their minds until just before voting. I buy that Trump has a substantial lead, but itâ€™s the third inning, not the bottom of the ninth. Credit: BloombergÂ  ",NA

These six MLAs had supported the BJP nominee Harsh Mahajan in the Rajya Sabha elections and subsequently contested the bypolls on BJP tickets. Sudhir Sharma and Inder Dutt Lakhanpal were re-elected, while the other four lost their bids. Himachal Pradesh becomes the first state to pass such a bill, which stipulates that individuals disqualified under the Tenth Schedule are ineligible for pensions. The bill, which was passed by voice vote, aims to address the lack of provisions in the 1971 Act to discourage defections and preserve democratic values. Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu argued that the bill is necessary to uphold democratic principles and deter defections. However, opposition BJP members have criticized the bill as ""political revenge"" and questioned its retrospective application. They argue that the bill was introduced hastily and should be reviewed by a Select Committee. BJP leaders also contend that the disqualified MLAs were not defectors as they had not officially joined the BJP at the time of the Rajya Sabha vote. Revenue Minister Jagat Singh Negi defended the bill, emphasising that it is essential to prevent defection and protect the democratic process. The bill will become law once it receives the governor's consent. (With inputs from agencies) ",NA

This development follows a two-year preliminary inquiry that began after a pen drive was handed over to the then Maharashtra Assembly Speaker by Devendra Fadnavis, who was the Leader of the Opposition at the time. The investigation, initially handled by the CID, was later transferred to the CBI. According to the FIR, the CBIâ€™s inquiry found that Special Public Prosecutor Pravin Pandit Chavan conspired with Vijay Bhaskarrao Patil and Anil Deshmukh to file a zero FIR in December 2020 at Nimbhora Jalgaon police station. The FIR, linked to a two-year-old incident in Pune, was allegedly filed with the intent to falsely implicate BJP leaders and others in order to gain control over the Jalgaon Zilla Maratha Vidya Prasarak Sahakari Samaj Limited, an educational institution. The zero FIR was eventually transferred to Pune, where it was registered on January 5, 2021. The CBI has also accused former DCP Poornima Gaikwad and ACP Sushma Chavan of fabricating witness statements and evidence to support the conspiracy. Besides Deshmukh, Chavan, Patil, Gaikwad, and Sushma Chavan have been named as accused in the case. Deshmukh, however, has dismissed the allegations as baseless, accusing Devendra Fadnavis of orchestrating the conspiracy for political reasons. He took to social media platform â€˜Xâ€™ to state that such efforts are a result of Fadnavis losing political ground and vowed to continue fighting against what he termed BJP's oppression. Deshmukh further accused Fadnavis of engaging in ""dirty politics"" and expressed confidence that the people of Maharashtra would see through the conspiracy ahead of the upcoming assembly elections.

136,India-Singapore Trade Ties: Boosting economic relations amid regional challenges and changing global landscape,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/india-singapore-trade-ties-boosting-economic-relations-amid-regional-challenges-and-changing-global-landscape-12813918.html,Politics,2024-09-04 08:24:00+05:30,"By Anisree SureshÂ  The 2nd edition of the India-Singapore Ministerial Roundtable (ISMR) was held in Singapore on August 26, focusing on trade and economic cooperation between the two nations, ahead of PM Narendra Modiâ€™s September 4-5 visit. India's delegation of four union ministers was led by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman, who deliberated on six priority pillars for the bilateral partnership in emerging and futuristic areas.Â  While active bilateral political coordination and economic engagement are strengthening at a rapid pace, it is crucial for India to rethink its trade policies and forgo its protectionist measures urgently. This is necessary to integrate better with the broader global value chains and to tap into the economic prospects offered by the Southeast Asian markets. Significance of India-Singapore Ties India's bilateral relations with Singapore are of immense significance to India's policymakers. Singapore, as India's sixth largest trading partner, with a total trade of $35.61 billion, accounts for approximately 29 percent of India's total trade with ASEAN. It is also India's largest source of FDI, with a $ 11.7 billion invested in FY 2023-24, though a significant portion of this due to roundtripping. India's economic reforms in the 1990s, its â€˜Look East Policyâ€™, and later â€˜Act East Policyâ€™ have led to a new framework for cooperation with Southeast Asian countries, including the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) between India and Singapore in 2005. With over 20 active routine bilateral engagements and an India-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in Goods, Singapore plays a crucial role in enhancing India's participation in regional supply chain arrangements in the wider Indo-Pacific region. However, it remains to be seen if they have fully realized their trade potential. Trade Dynamics and Challenges The import concession rates that imports from Singapore enjoy in India fuel the trade relations to some extent. The CECA helped India and Singapore liberalise trade relations by establishing mutual recognition agreements, liberalising visa rules, and launching e-commerce platforms. The rapid growth of Singapore's digital economy and trends in the global demand and supply for tech talent have increased the prospects of Indian talent migration to Singapore. Although trade and connectivity are significantly increasing between both countries, a few concerns continue to impact achieving the fullest potential of the trade prospects. India's trade concerns include inadequate market access for services exports and greater mobility of people to deliver them (professional talent migration).Â  India's continued connectivity dilemma in integrating well with its eastern neighbours continues to hamper the trade prospects.Â  Although trade relations with Singapore are strong, India has not fully captured other Southeast Asian markets. The decision not to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) has further exacerbated this gap. Impact of RCEP and Strategic Opportunities  Though India was party to the initial negotiations, it has decided to abstain from joining the RCEP Agreement to safeguard the interests of the agriculture and dairy sectors. Moreover, India has been experiencing a trade deficit with most RCEP participating countries. Due to its decision to abstain, India had to forgo market access in sectors such as IT and pharmaceuticals, where it enjoys a comparative advantage and risk of trade diversion away from Indian products and services as RCEP members gained preferential access to each other's markets. Despite the individual agreements that India has with many East Asian and South Asian countries, it cannot boost trade in the same way as a multilateral deal with the scope of RCEP, and that continues to impact India's trade prospects with the region, as ASEAN strongly promotes the economic integration with its FTA partners. Future Directions for Economic Integration India must also engage with Singapore to liberalise the service sector and maximise its comparative advantage. Given Singaporeâ€™s role as a hub for trade and finance in the Southeast Asian region, India can leverage this by offering fintech products, IT services, and backend processing. Both countries can also collaborate in the semiconductor ecosystem, combining Indiaâ€™s design skills with Singaporeâ€™s 20 years of ecosystem management experience. By focusing on liberalising the trade in goods and services and providing seamless connectivity, intra-regional trade can be improved. From Indiaâ€™s end, Visa-on-arrival for Singapore citizens and cross-border transit projects will increase the physical connectivity between the two regions. This enhanced physical connectivity would help India to integrate well with its Southeast Asian neighbours. Simultaneously, India could also explore preferential trading agreements with other Southeast Asian economies, such as the Philippines, Vietnam, and Indonesia. India-Singapore trade relations are progressing positively, and with a further push on economic integration, the challenges of not joining the RCEP can be overcome. In a world which is slowly deglobalising, India must take every opportunity to augment trade relations with existing partners.

137,"Caste Census: RSS advocates constitutional and administrative approach, not a political one",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/caste-census-rss-advocates-constitutional-and-administrative-approach-not-a-political-one-12813532.html,Politics,2024-09-03 16:07:00+05:30,"After the three-day all-India co-ordination meeting of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ended at Palakkad in Kerala on September 2, another round of debate on the ŌĆścaste censusŌĆÖ has been kicked off. RSS Prachar Pramukh Sunil Ambekar stated in a press conference that if the government feels that enumeration for certain communities is required for some government schemes, then it may be done. This has been interpreted by many as an endorsement of the ŌĆścaste censusŌĆÖ by the RSS. So what exactly is the RSSŌĆÖs stand on the ŌĆścaste censusŌĆÖ? Has it changed? How has it evolved? First and foremost, the RSS has never changed its stand on issues related to caste. One must look at the larger philosophical framework that guides the RSSŌĆÖs thinking on issues such as the ŌĆścaste censusŌĆÖ and ŌĆśreservationŌĆÖ to understand its position. RSSŌĆÖ philosophical framework on Caste related issues The RSS is deeply concerned about the misuse of the issue of caste census for political gains.┬Ā On caste census as well as reservation, the RSS stand has been clear: whatever steps need to be taken for the benefit of the marginalised sections of the society by the government of the day within the constitutional framework, should be taken. The RSSŌĆÖ stand in this context is clear. It believes sensitive issues like caste census and reservation should be kept out of the political realm and shouldnŌĆÖt be weaponized for creating vote banks as this would harm the society in the long run. There are three aspects of RSSŌĆÖ stand on Caste related issues. First, issues related to the benefit of the marginalised sections of the society should not become a political and electoral tool. For Congress and its allies, the issue of ŌĆścaste censusŌĆÖ is an end in itself to garner votes on caste basis whereas for the RSS, such issues are means to attain the goal of larger welfare of the marginalised sections which they deserve.┬Ā That is why, issues related to the benefits of the marginalised sections shouldnŌĆÖt be politicised. Second, the RSS believes that caste census shouldnŌĆÖt be used to wedge a divide in the society. There is a distinct attempt to weaponize issues related to benefits of the marginalised sections to promote fissures within the society. Caste Census is the latest ŌĆśweaponŌĆÖ in the hands of certain political parties who are ready to go to any extent for petty political gains. This would ultimately harm the marginalised sections of the society. The classical case study in this context is the way ŌĆśMuslimsŌĆÖ were converted into a vote bank in the garb of pseudo-secularism which ultimately affected their overall socio-economic growth. They were deliberately kept backward and the progressive leadership amongst them was never encouraged by the Congress, Left, Socialists and other non-BJP parties. A similar situation was created for the scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and other backward castes also till 2014.┬Ā Over the last 10-years, the process of providing benefits was depoliticised to a great extent but unfortunately, this politicisation seems to be making a comeback and taking a centre stage in Indian politics. The RSS has always been of the opinion that certain issues that would bring greater good to the society and make it more equitable should be kept out of the political battlefield and hence the issue of 'caste census' should also be depoliticised. Third aspect of the RSSŌĆÖ stand on any of the issues related to the marginalised sections of the society is that the beneficiaries of various constitutional provisions such as reservation should be the one to take a call on how they want to go ahead. The highest decision-making body of the RSS, Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha (ABPS), had┬Āpassed a┬Āresolution┬Āway back in 1981, much before the Mandal Commission brought the issue of reservation to the centre-stage of Indian politics in the 1990s. The resolution categorically stated, ŌĆ£The RSS considers it necessary that reservation be continued for the present with a view to bringing all these brethren of ours who have remained backward in educational, social and economic fields over the centuries at par with the rest of society.ŌĆØ In 2019, the present Sarkaryavah of the RSS Dattatreya Hosabale had categorically┬Āsaid┬Āin a press conference during the All India Coordination Meeting at Pushkar (Rajasthan), ŌĆ£It is for the beneficiaries of the reservation to decide how long it should continue. It should continue as long as they want it.ŌĆØ RSS Practises what it preaches Unlike most of the political parties, the RSS practises what it preaches. It has a separate vertical called ŌĆśSamajik SamrastaŌĆÖ(social harmony) which works for mainstreaming of the socially backward sections of the society. Its volunteers and 32 RSS inspired organisations are carrying out more than 2 lakh welfare projects across the country primarily to empower socio-economically marginalised sections of the society. Both┬ĀMahatma┬ĀGandhi and Dr. BR┬ĀAmbedkar┬Āwere deeply impressed by the RSSŌĆÖ efforts to end caste discrimination right since its inception. Both of them witnessed the RSS functioning first hand. Dr Ambedkar visited an RSS shakha in Dapoli in Maharashtra in┬Ā1939┬Āwhile Mahatma Gandhi┬Āvisited┬Āan RSS training camp at Maharashtra in 1935. Harijan, a weekly newspaper published by Mahatma Gandhi┬Āreported┬Āthis event on 28 September 1947. The report said: ŌĆ£Gandhi ji said that he had visited the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh camp years ago at Wardha, when the founder Shri Hedgewar was alive. The late Shri Jamnalal Bajaj had taken him to the camp and he (Gandhi) had been very well impressed by their discipline, complete absence of untouchability and rigorous simplicity.ŌĆØ The RSSŌĆÖ worldview on the caste issue in Bharat is best depicted by a lecture delivered by the RSSŌĆÖ third Sarsanghchalak Balasaheb Deoras at the Vasant Vyakhyanmala in Pune in 1974. Deoras┬Āsaid,┬ĀŌĆ£Untouchability is aŌĆ” saddening and unfortunate aspect of our social inequality. Some thinkers opine that it was non-existent in the olden times, but at some stage, during the passage of time, it gatecrashed into our social system and took root. Whatever be its origin, all of us consider that untouchability is a terrible folly and it must, of necessity, be thrown out lock, stock and barrel. There are no two opinions about it. Abraham Lincoln, who abolished slavery in America, said, ŌĆ£If slavery is not wrong, then nothing is wrong.ŌĆØ Similarly, it is for all of us to declare, ŌĆ£If untouchability is not wrong, then nothing in the world is wrong!ŌĆØ Every one of us must, therefore, aim at eradicating social inequality in each and every form. We must clearly explain to the people at large how our society became weak and disorganised on account of social inequalities. We must also show them the way to get rid of them. It is necessary that every individual must make his or her contribution in this effort. That would remove a stumbling block in the way of Hindu Consolidation.ŌĆØ Conclusion The RSS believes that issues related to the ŌĆścasteŌĆÖ shouldnŌĆÖt be weaponized by political parties as this would create social disharmony. Whatever needs to be done for the benefit of the marginalised sections of the society should be done within the constitutional framework and in a positive environment. And for the sake of this countryŌĆÖs integrity and Hindu unity, political parties should lay their hands off this sensitive issue. That is the least they can do if they are really committed to preserve the serenity and integrity of this nation. Let issues like ŌĆścaste censusŌĆÖ be handled constitutionally, administratively and socially and not politically.

139,Netanyahuâ€™s conflicts of interest are hurting Israel over the war in Gaza,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/benjamin-netanyahus-conflicts-of-interest-are-hurting-israel-over-the-war-in-gaza-12813192.html,Politics,2024-09-03 12:28:00+05:30,"Thereâ€™s no job on earth less attractive than being a head of stateÂ forced to decide betweenÂ cutting a hostage deal with terrorists that risks encouragingÂ repetition, or consigning innocents to be murdered. Israelâ€™s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu knows this dilemma better than anyone. To get a single soldier back in 2011, he traded more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, including Yahya Sinwar, the current Hamas leader who more than a decade later masterminded the mass hostage grab of Oct. 7. So why was there so much anger against Netanyahu this weekend, rather than empathy for the burden he carries, afterÂ sixÂ hostages were killed by their minders in a Gaza tunnel? Hamas is, after all, the villainÂ of this piece;Â itâ€™s both kidnapperÂ andÂ executioner. Yet Netanyahuâ€™s refusal to agree to a cease-fire provoked the largest street protests of the war to date, as well as a nationwide strike by Israelâ€™s biggest trades union and the shuttering of malls and businesses in sympathy. Judging by the language of the protesters and hostage families, the answer lies in a profound lack of trust in the prime ministerâ€™s motivationsÂ as he makes these decisions of life,Â death, war and peace for others. Netanyahuâ€™s 180-degree change of approach to dealing with hostage takers may be one source of that mistrust. In the one-for-1,027 swap of 2011, for example, he said he was agreeing to releaseÂ even Hamas prisoners jailed for killingÂ IsraelisÂ becauseÂ ""the state of Israel does not abandon its soldiers and citizens.â€ť Now, he says Israel must do exactly that, rather than â€śsurrenderâ€ť to Hamas. A second reason lies in the details of what such a surrender would mean. Hamas has been heavily degraded as a fighting force, so no Israeli troops would be waving white flags. The capitulationÂ Netanyahu is ruling out would instead be very specific to the cease-fire negotiations, which have stalled over his late addition of a demand that Israeli forces should retain control of the so-called Philadelphi corridor. Netanyahu says commanding thisÂ a narrow strip of land along Gazaâ€™s border with Egypt is vital to Israelâ€™s security. Yet his own defense minister, Yoav Gallant, says that isnâ€™t true. Nor was the corridor even mentioned in Israelâ€™s original cease-fire proposal â€” an odd omission if it is indeed so critical as to warrant the sacrifice of more Jewish and Palestinian lives. â€śThe fact that we prioritize the Philadelphi Corridor at the cost of the lives of the hostages is a moral disgrace,â€ťÂ Gallant told Israelâ€™s security cabinet, which met on Sunday in the wake of the executions, according to a leaked report of the proceedings in the Times of Israel. Other top security officials also have said the corridor isnâ€™t a make-or-break issue, not least because the tunnels Hamas built under the Egyptian border to smuggle arms begin and end outside it. The deeper source of popular malaise, though, is that Netanyahu has so many apparent conflicts of interest. A prominent call from protesters is that the prime minister should â€śtake responsibility.â€ť Not only did Netanyahu set Sinwar free in 2011, but Oct. 7 also took place on his watch. There are many who will have to share responsibility for this spectacular security failure in the investigation thatâ€™s certain to follow the war;Â but as the prime minister who oversaw a policy of shifting attention and security resources to the West Bank from Gaza, Netanyahu wouldÂ top the list. Ending the war would accelerate other reckonings for the prime minister. The extreme-right leaders on whom he relies for power have made it clear they will bring down the government the moment he agrees to a cease-fire. They see the conflict as a once-in-a-life-time opportunity to expand Jewish settlement in both the West Bank and Gaza, a goal that requires the long-term military occupation of Palestinian territories. And should the government collapse, an out-of-powerÂ Netanyahu would face ongoing court cases on charges of fraud, breach of trust and bribery as an ordinary citizen. Jail time is aÂ realÂ possibility. Small wonder that so many Israelis believe Netanyahu is driven by personal, rather than national, interests on decisions that might end the fighting. Iâ€™m not at all certain that Netanyahu shares the views of his national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, who wants to replace Palestinians in Gaza with Jewish settlers and recently made an inflammatory call for the construction of a synagogue on the Temple Mount. Thatâ€™s been the site of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest site in Islam, since the 7th century. Nor can anyone outside Netanyahuâ€™s tightest circle be sure that this great political survivor is driven by anything other than his view of the national interest. But, as in all such cases, itâ€™sÂ the appearance of a conflict of interestÂ that counts, precisely because it erodes trust and encourages people to believe the worst. Netanyahu continues to enjoy domestic support for pursuing the destruction of Hamas. But as the implications for the remaining hostages of continuing the war become increasingly clear, this lack of trust in his motives is dividing the nation. Politicians around the democratic world have walked away from power over less. Credit: BloombergÂ  ",NA
140,"Key Takeaways from RSS Meet: Focus on expansion, women safety, protecting Hindus globally",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/key-takeaways-from-rss-meet-focus-on-expansion-women-safety-protecting-hindus-globally-12813084.html,Politics,2024-09-03 11:56:00+05:30,"The much awaited three-day all India Coordination meeting of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) at Palakkad in Kerala ended on September 2. The meeting was attended by senior functionaries of 32 RSS-inspired organisations including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).┬Ā Here are some key takeaways from this meeting that also give an indication about the future roadmap of the RSS that is turning 100 next year. No Big Bang Celebrations but Massive Thrust on Expansion The RSS will formally start its centenary programs from October 2025, on Vijaydashami. The RSS was set up on Vijaydashami in 1925. First and foremost, the RSS will not have any big bang celebrations but will use this opportunity to give a major thrust to its organizational outreach at all levels and among all sections of society. This is part of the long-standing RSS tradition that instead of focusing on optics, the emphasis is on real work in the field. In 1989-90, similar outreach programs were held during the centenary celebrations of its founder Dr. Keshav Baliram Hedgewar. During the centenary celebrations of the second Sarsanghchalak, MS Golwalkar, popularly known as ŌĆśGuruji,ŌĆÖ the RSS organized meetings and public programs across the country at the district level. The central theme of all these celebrations remains the sameŌĆöHindu unity with a specific focus on mainstreaming marginalized sections of society. For the RSS centenary celebrations, the central theme will remain the same, and all RSS-inspired organizations will carry out their programs accordingly. Women Safety and Empowerment Thirty-two women delegates attended the Palakkad meeting. The RSS has not only taken notice of the tragic incident at RG Kar Hospital in Kolkata but has decided to launch a massive campaign to enhance womenŌĆÖs safety across the country. RSS Prachar Pramukh Sunil Ambekar detailed this in a press conference on September 2 at Palakkad, briefing the media about the meetingŌĆÖs deliberations. The RSS has been deeply concerned about womenŌĆÖs safety in the past as well. One key deterrent for enhancing womenŌĆÖs safety is speedy trials and quick justice for victims. Ambekar mentioned that the RSS wants fast-track courts and speedy justice, along with any necessary legal amendments. However, the RSS believes that, in addition to the government and law-and-order machinery, this issue also requires societal transformation. Men in society need to view women with greater respect, achievable through proper upbringing. WomenŌĆÖs safety and societal attitudes toward women are now key areas the RSS will focus on. According to Ambekar, ŌĆ£The RSS and its inspired organisations have held 472 women conferences in the recent past with participation of more than 5.75 lakh women. These conferences were held in almost every state at the district level where issues of women empowerment and their safety were discussed at length followed by actionable programmes that are being implemented. It is important to know that the RSS has been working on the issue of women empowerment since the 1930s. It started with the setting up of Rashtra Sevika Samiti, an organisation for women that works with the women volunteers. The RSS had set up several decades ago an internal co-ordination mechanism to work with women volunteers. This mechanism is known as┬ĀŌĆśMahila SamanvayŌĆÖ. Ambekar has mentioned in his book, ŌĆśThe RSS Roadmap for 21st┬ĀCenturyŌĆÖ,┬ĀŌĆ£In 2017, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh organised a massive march in Delhi with two lakh people, one lakh of the activist force were women. Vigyan Bharati started Shakti, a conclave of women scientists. Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram and Samskar Bharati have many women full-timers.ŌĆØ Standing up for Hindus globally The RSS has been taking up the cause of Hindus globally and would continue to do so. Especially in the context of the ongoing developments in Bangladesh where Hindu minorities are being targeted by radical Islamists, the RSS has taken up the issue with the government and is also working round the clock through organisations like Vishwa Hindu Parishad.┬Ā The issue was discussed at length in the RSS meet at Palakkad. The organisation is clear about it that wherever the Hindus would be in trouble across the world, it would take up their cause at the government level and would also try to do whatever it can for them directly through its inspired organisations and volunteers who have a global reach now.

The report said that the floor price of the block deal is Rs 1,470 per share, a discount of 4.6 percent to the closing price of Indigo Paints on September 5. It added that investment bank Jefferies is acting as the advisor on the deal. Peak XV Partners Investments declined to comment and Jefferies couldn't be reached for an immediate response.

144,Twelve IPOs will compete to raise over $1 billion next week,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/twelve-ipos-will-compete-to-raise-over-1-billion-in-a-single-week-12815780.html,Market,2024-09-06 10:01:00+05:30,"Twelve initial public offers (IPOs), which include four from the main board and eight from small and medium enterprises (SMEs), are looking to raise over $1 billion or Rs 8,600 crore in the coming week. Among the main board IPOs, the four firms that will compete for investor attention are Bajaj Housing Finance, which will raise around Rs 6,560 crore, Tolins Tyres (Rs 230 crore), Kross Ltd (Rs 500 crore) and P N Gadgil Jewellers (Rs 1,100 crore). Another main board IPO, Western Carriers India, is likely to open soon though the company is yet to announce the details in terms of the issue opening and closing dates. While Bajaj Housing Finance, Tolins Tyres and Kross Ltd will open for subscription on September 9 and close on September 11, P N Gadgil Jeweller IPO will open on September 10 and close on September 12.  Apurva Sheth, Head of Market Perspectives and Research at SAMCO Securities, highlights several factors driving the positive trend in India's primary market. The current market buoyancy is fueled by broad investor participation with retail investors eager to capitalise on attractive listing gains, spurred by the strong performance of the secondary market -- Nifty is up 15.71 percent in the current calendar year till date. Additionally, robust liquidity among both domestic and foreign institutional investors has significantly bolstered the IPO market pipeline. Incidentally, the grey market premiums (GMP) for these firms are also surging. Bajaj Housing Finance GMP is trading at Rs 51 a share, up 73 percent from its upper end price band of Rs 70 a share, Tolins Tyres GMP is trading 12 percent higher while P N Gadgil Jewellers IPO is trading over 37 percent higher. Among SME IPOs, four companies -- Gajanand International, Share Samadhan, Shubhshree Biofuels Energy and Aditya Ultra Steel -- will open for subscription on September 9 and close on September 11. Two firms -- Trafiksol ITS Technologies, SPP Polymer -- will open on September 10 and close on September 13 while another two -- Innomet Advanced Materials and Excellent Wires & Packaging -- will open on September 11 and close on September 13. These firms will raise between Rs 12-45 crore each through their public issues. The recent past has seen IPOs attracting huge subscriptions. Among main board IPOs in August, the average subscription was over 75 times, while the average for 2024 so far stands at 66 times. For SME IPOs, the average subscription in August reached 290 times, with a year-to-date average of over 259 times. The strong subscription across IPOs has been driven by robust participation from retail, institutional, and foreign investors. Data from NSDL shows that while foreign investors have been net sellers in secondary markets, they have consistently invested in primary markets. In August, FIIs invested around Rs 12,872 crore, and so far in CY24, their investments in primary markets have totalled around Rs54,883 crore. Analysts note that most recent IPO offerings are emerging from high-growth, sunrise sectors, thereby attracting investors anticipating strong growth potential. This trend is expected to continue through the rest of 2024 and may extend into 2025, they say. â€śWith growing retail participation and renewed interest from FIIs, driven largely by evolving global macroeconomic conditions, the market environment seems favorable for several upcoming IPOs to finally make their debut on the bourses. The recent success of multiple listings is likely to generate even greater interest in the next wave of IPOs,â€ť says Nirav Karkera, Head of Research at Fisdom.

The investment firm partnered with Indigo Paints in the year 2014, according to its website. Indigo Paints, which was founded in the year 2000, had its IPO in 2021. The stock has fallen as much as 42 percent since its debut. It has also underperformed this year, rising less than 3 percent since January, far slower than the Niftyâ€™s 15 percent gain. Analysts are optimistic about Indigo Paintsâ€™ growth due to brand acceptance and a wider distribution network but warn of competitive risks.

154,"Daily Voice: Unmesh Sharma of HDFC Securities explains why he's underweight on IT space, added exposure to FMCG",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/daily-voice-unmesh-sharma-of-hdfc-securities-explains-why-he-is-underweight-on-it-space-adds-exposure-to-fmcg-12815662.html,Market,2024-09-06 09:13:00+05:30,"HDFC Securities continues to be underweight on the IT sector, says Head of Institutional Equities, Unmesh Sharma. ""We would await more convincing data before turning decisively positive on the sector."" According to him, valuations have already moved up and now Nifty IT is trading at +2standard deviation above mean levels leaving little room for further appreciation. The Nifty IT rallied more than 35 percent since June lows. In case of FMCG space, HDFC Securities has become constructive on the sector and increased allocation in HSIE model portfolio, said Sharma who has over 20 years of experience in the capital markets. What is your earnings forecast for Q2FY25 after reading Q1FY25 numbers? Earnings growth for our coverage universe of 229 stocks got benefited by low input costs and hence far outperformed revenue growth in FY24. In our view, the advantages of soft input costs have largely been consumed and hereon earnings growth must be demand led. So, earnings growth is expected to be closer to revenue growth in FY25, as base effect also catches up. Signs of the earnings growth moderation was visible in Q1FY25 itself when we witnessed 0 percent YoY earnings growth for coverage universe (ex-OMCs, 13 percent YoY growth). It contrasted with 20 percent and 22 percent YoY growth in Q3FY24 and Q4FY24, respectively. We believe YoY earnings growth for Q2FY25 will be in high single digits and for FY25E, it is expected to be 6 percent (ex-energy 13 percent). Have you increased exposure to FMCG and IT space? FMCG FMCG stocks have undergone a moderation in valuations in last couple of years before a recent pickup. Further, there have been a gradual volume growth recovery, which makes us have a close relook at the sector. We expect consumption demand to witness a slight pickup in FY25 driven by normal monsoon, gradual rural recovery, and transmission of input cost benefits to consumers by FMCG companies. Hence, we have become constructive on the sector and increased allocation, as reflected in HSIE model portfolio. IT Led by BFSI clients, green shoots are visible in the demand environment for IT services sector but macro uncertainty and subdued discretionary spendings continue. Furthermore, deal conversions to revenue transmission has improved marginally which reflects early signs of recovery. In view of the short-term uncertainty but bright long-term prospects for the sector, we have built in a gradual recovery in next two years. While sector is awaiting a convincing growth environment, valuations have already moved up and now Nifty IT is trading at +2 standard deviation above mean levels leaving little room for further appreciation. Hence, we continue to be underweight on the sector. We would await more convincing data before turning decisively positive on the sector. Are you considering fresh entry into defence and railway stocks? We donâ€™t have any coverage on defence/railway stocks, nonetheless we have keenly tracked valuations of stocks in these sectors. In our view, the defence and railway themes are potent, and these will continue fueling earnings growth of the involved companies for several more quarters, however many stocks have run ahead of their fundamentals meaningfully. Hence, we wouldnâ€™t recommend a fresh entry until valuation softens to more palatable levels. Do you see better opportunities in new IPOs? In our view, investors are able to identify the nuances to attribute high PEs to profitability and sustainability of delivery. We think the best way to look at IPO situations is on a case-by-case basis; the individual business models are different and so are the markets and customers they service. Itâ€™s not prudent to club them together because the key drivers for these companies especially mortality are different. We take a bottom-up approach to evaluating these companies and focus on the sustainability of their respective business models. Itâ€™s important to have a degree of embedded scrutiny when looking at these new-age tech companies in order to evaluate which of them will have successfully disrupted and changed their industries in the next decade. Your take on consumer staples? Consumer staples segment has been witnessing gradual demand growth revival led by summer portfolio and varied degrees of rural recovery observed by the companies. Hot beverages and refreshment portfolios which remained subdued due to heatwaves in Q1FY25 are expected to show decent growth as summer recedes. Further, normal monsoon and moderate inflation bodes well for rural consumption. Additionally, soft input costs regime has continued which has helped staple companies invest towards A&P and pass on benefits to consumers. In view of all these factors supporting the segment, we have turned constructive on the sector. It can be noted that given our positive view on the sector, we have been reducing our extent of being underweight on the sector in last two quarters and now we have turned marginally overweight, as reflected in the HSIE model portfolio. Do you think Fed may not be aggressive in interest rate cuts, and the RBI may go for one rate cut in 2024? The market is building in a rate cut - also confirmed by recent comments by the Fed Chairperson in recent Jackson Hole Summit. The question is whatâ€™s the quantum? Based on bond market, 30 percent of the market thinks we can get a 50-bps rate cut in September FOMC meet while the majority thinks it is going to be 25bps. Economic data on growth and inflation in the US put us in the second camp. Further, if we consider FEDâ€™s stance for CY24, we expect Fed to cut rate 2-3 times (50-75 bps in total) by December-end. Accordingly, RBI is expected to take a cue from this and begin rate cut cycle with a 25bps cut in CY24.

The outlook for Vodafone Idea seemed bleak with Goldman anticipating Vodafone Idea to lose another 300 basis points in market share over the next 3-4 years. Even in an optimistic scenario - where the company's adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues are slashed by 65 percent, tariffs consistently increase, and no near-term government repayments are required - Goldman still sees a best-case implied value per share of just Rs 19 Follow our live blog for all the market action Indus Towers' shares fell over 6 perent after Goldman downgraded the stock to 'Sell' from 'Neutral' rating, although it hiked the target price to Rs 350 from Rs 220. Goldman noted a disconnect between the company's fundamentals and its current valuations while also saying that the recent re-rating of Indus Towers is overdone. The firm sees limited visibility on medium- and long-term growth prospects. Goldman Sachs would adopt a more constructive stance only if Vodafone Idea, one of Indus's key clients, can successfully repair its balance sheet. Notably, Indus Towers' stock has surged over 75 percent in the past six months and is currently trading at Rs 443, which is 26 percent above Goldman Sachs' target price of Rs 350. Also Read |Â Govt won't interfere in Vodafone Idea's affairs, says telecom minister Scindia However, for Bharti Airtel, Goldman Sachs significantly raised its target price to Rs 1,700 from the previous Rs 900, indicating an upside of 10 percent from the stock's current market price. The firm has also maintained its 'Buy' rating. The global brokerage said thatÂ strong growth and a turning point in free cash flow (FCF) and returns profile, warrant the stock's premium valuation. Goldman believes Bharti Airtel's growth momentum will continue, driven by market share gains, organic growth levers, and potential future tariff hikes. The company's India revenue and EBITDA are expected to grow at 16 percent and 21 percent CAGR over FY24-27. Additionally, Goldman foresees Bharti Airtel achieving improvements in its balance sheet.

Another hike in capital gains could be on the card, the Jefferies note said, adding that the increase contributes to higher nervousness, especially since investors in many other Asian economies face no capital gains tax at all. Equities now attract aÂ long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) of 12.5 percent, up from from 10 percent, while short-term capital gains tax (STCG)Â would be 20 percent, up from 15 percent earlier, as announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman inÂ the Union Budget in July.

Brokerage Jefferies estimates that Reliance Jio could list in 2025 at $115 billion Relianceâ€™s telecom arm Jio could list on the stock exchanges in 2025 calendar year with a likely valuation of $112 billion, global brokerage Jefferies has said in a report, the Business Standard reported. Reliance Industries could look to spin off Jio Platforms and list it after a price discovery. Why itâ€™s important: Any move by Reliance to publicly list Jio will be sure to meet with enthusiasm by both retail and institutional investors. Local and foreign investors typically prefer spinoffs in India as holding company discounts are much cheaper in the country then elsewhere in Asia. #2. Hyundai Motorsâ€™ $3-3.5 IPO could see MNCs rushing to publicly list India businesses South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Companyâ€™s plans for a $3â€“3.5 billion listing of its Indian subsidiary could spur a revival in international companies looking to list their subsidiaries in India. Hyundai Motor India Ltd is expected to reach a valuation of close to $20 billion post the public listing of its shares. Why itâ€™s important: The share sale is expected to be Indiaâ€™s second biggest, which will offer cues to other MNCs on the benefits of resilient stock markets, robust economic prospects and a growing consumer base. #3. Canadaâ€™s Brookfield makes equity investment of $200 million in Leap Green EnergyÂ  Canadian asset management firm Brookfield has made an equity investment of over $200 million in Tamil Nadu-based renewable energy company Leap Green Energy, with an option to infuse an additional $350 million in the future, the Mint reported. Why itâ€™s important: Brookfieldâ€™s investment is another instance of the strong investor interest in India green energy transition. The deal activity in this space is expected to accelerate further in the near term. #4. Government may raise threshold for cost audit bookkeeping for small and medium enterprisesÂ  A government committee has suggested an increase in the turnover limit of firms mandated to keep and audit cost accounts of inputs, the Economic Times reported. The turnover limit could be raised to Rs 75 crore in any of the past three years to maintain and audit cost records from Rs 25 crore for firms in six regulated sectors and Rs 35 crore for those in 33 unregulated sectors for mandatory cost audits. Why itâ€™s important: The move to raise the threshold for such bookkeeping will effectively free all small and most medium enterprises from the compliance burden and will be welcomed by the SME sector. #5. Small manufacturers take biggest big in Indiaâ€™s struggling informal economyÂ  Small manufacturers in the informal sector have been particularly hit between 2015-16 and 2021-22, showing a sharp fall, according to an analysis by Hindu Businessline based on National Sample Survey Officeâ€™s unincorporated enterprises surveys. The number of unincorporated non-farm enterprises in 2015-16 was 6.34 crore, which rose to just 6.5 crore in 2022-23. The fall was the sharpest in manufacturing, with a decline of 24 lakh firms. The share of small manufacturers fell from 31 percent in 2015-16 to 27.4 percent in 2022-23. Why itâ€™s important: The slow growth in manufacturing has been for long a pain point for the Indian economy. A string of events such as demonetization, GST implementation and the pandemic were the main factors behind the big drop. #6. Indian government readies plan to double number of airports to 300 by 2047 India plans to more than double its airport count to 300 by 2047 due to an anticipated eightfold increase in passenger traffic, a draft plan made by the Airport Authority of India showed the Mint reported. It will involve developing existing airstrips to full-scale airports and building new ones from scratch. Why itâ€™s important: Annual air passenger traffic is expected to grow from 376 million to 3-3.5 billion by 2047, out of which 10-12 percent may be international traffic. The under-penetration of air travel, rising income levels and improving connectivity to new destinations will be key growth drivers for the industry. #7. FMCG companies pin hopes on rising rural demand to spur sales this summerÂ  Consumer goods firms are launching low-unit packs and stepping up distribution and stocking of grocery stores in the countryside as they shift attention back to rural India, the Economic Times reported, citing industry executives. This is in sharp contrast to the past two years, when FMCGs like ITC, Dabur, Marico, Britannia, Parle Products, Emami and Hindustan Unilever focused on premiumization. Why itâ€™s important: Besides expectations of a good monsoon season that will bolster farm incomes, FMCG companies are expecting policy measures in the budget to strengthen the revival of demand in rural India. #8. Top 100 property developers see 70 percent leap in valuation in just one year The cumulative valuation of the top 100 real estate companies in India rose by 70 percent in the 12 months ending May, the Business Standard reported. According to the 2024 GROHE-Hurun India Real Estate 100 report, 86 of these companies saw an increase in value, contributing a total of Rs 6.2 lakh crore. The total valuation of the top 100 realty firms in India currently stands at Rs 14.2 lakh crore. Why itâ€™s important: After some years of sluggish growth, Indiaâ€™s real estate sector is outpacing China in the rate of expansion. This is also seen in the strong performance of the S&P BSE Realty Index, which expanded by 110 per cent in he past 12 months. #9. Anomalous job surge during the pandemic throws curve ball to economistsÂ  India is estimated to have created 108.9 million jobs between financial years 2019-20 and 2023-24, significantly higher than the 76.8 million jobs added between 2005-06 and 2029-20, the Mint reported, citing provisional data released by the Reserve Bank. In 2023-24 alone, India is estimated to have added 46.7 million jobs. Why itâ€™s important: The dataset on jobs has thrown a curveball at economists tracking Indiaâ€™s economy, baffling many on how the country managed to add a large number of jobs over the past few years despite the Covid-19 shock. #10. Hybrid carmakers in tizzy after slowing June sales and sops by Uttar PradeshÂ  Uttar Pradeshâ€™s decision to provide incentives for hybrid vehicles has puzzled electric vehicle manufacturers, especially as it comes on the heels of a plunge in June sales, the Economic Times reported. It has also divided the industry, pitting those betting on pure electrics such as Tata Motors against those that prefer the hybrid route like Toyota and Maruti Suzuki. Why itâ€™s important: The Indian market for electric vehicles could be following a global trend of slowing sales after a euphoric 2023. Hybrid sales in India could pick up though if other states follow Uttar Pradesh cue on waiving off registration charges, substantially reducing initial purchase costs.

Analysts pointed to the erratic monsoon as the main reason for the slowdown in volume growth. Brokerages have a divided view on the stock, with Motilal Oswal and JM Financial reiterating their 'buy' ratings, while Nuvama maintained its 'sell on rise' recommendation. According to analysts, as India moves toward a $5 trillion economy, its dependency on thermal power plants will rise to ensure 24x7 uninterrupted power supply, which is expected to benefit Coal India. The company aims to reach a production target of 838 MT in FY25, with e-auction dispatches comprising about 15 percent of total volumes. Supported by strong volume projections, healthy e-auction premiums, and reduced costs, Motilal Oswal maintains a positive outlook on Coal India, keeping it as their top pick in the metals and mining sector. ""We reiterate our BUY rating with a TP of Rs 600/share, valuing the stock at 6x FY26E EV/EBITDA,"" it said. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action Meanwhile, JM Financial highlighted that global coal prices have dropped significantly due to an oversupply in China, with Indonesian coal consolidating around $92-96/t, and Coal India's e-auction prices stabilizing at Rs 2,300-2,500/t. With a realistic production target of 838 MT for FY25, the firm remains confident in Coal India's long-term growth, driven by record power demand, increased focus on thermal capacity expansion, and strategic initiatives like MDO. The brokerage maintained a 'buy' rating on Coal India with an unchanged target price of Rs 601. Nuvama emphasised that the globe is not yet prepared to transition to renewable energy. So for the foreseeable future, coal will continue to be the most popular fuel. Additionally, as a result of the disruption in Russia's natural gas supply, demand has switched to coal. However, the brokerage emphasized several key risks for Coal India, including a decline in international coal prices, a significant drop in e-auction prices, lower-than-anticipated volume growth, and the potential sale of the Government of India's stake through Offer for Sale (OFS). Coal India stock ended 1.2 percent lower at Rs 497.20 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in the previous session. The stock has gained around 30 percent so far this year, outperforming Nifty's returns of 15 percent. In the past 12 months, the counter has zoomed 94 percent, nearly doubling investors' capital.

But over the short-term, a key trigger buoying the markets is falling crude prices. This time around falling oil prices arenâ€™t indicative of sluggish demand, but heightened supply. Non-OPEC oil producers are chipping away at the stalwartâ€™s market-share, flooding the markets with cheaper fuel. While oil has exited the stage to give renewable energy its share of the limelight, we all know who is running the show behind the scenes. Experts estimate that demand for crude oil is likely to surge, as the burgeoning AI-sector will only expand, and with it, the need for fuel. In a recent update, Google-parent Alphabet gave up its â€˜carbon-zeroâ€™ claim as its bet on artificial intelligence led to emissions soaring by around 50 percent, while other tech giants have doubled down on purchasing carbon offsets. However, Goldman Sachs shares a contrarian view to most oil experts: AI will actually weigh on oil prices. Artificial intelligence could improve logistics capabilities and boost oil production, leading to higher supply which will push oil prices down. Regardless, it seems like oil isnâ€™t going away anytime soon, and the AI revolution could be a make-or-break moment, driving (or curtailing) demand in unprecedented manners. The markets, as always, are watching closely. Uno Minda (Rs 1,132, -3%) Kotak Institutional Equities downgraded the stock to a 'sell' rating. Bear case: Growth momentum to moderate amid slowdown in passenger vehicle segment and new porduct addition coupled with capacity expansion to drag margins lower. KIE also sees risk reward for the stock as unfavourable due to expensive valuations. Bull case: Despite moderation, the company is likely to continue to outperform industry growth driven by the premiumization trend across 2W and 4W, strong order wins and market share expansion. Suzlon Energy (Rs 76.25, +2.8%) The company sold and leased back its prime real estate in Pune for five years, raising Rs 4.4 billion. Bull Case: The capital will be used to enhance execution capabilities. Company is expected to secure over 2GW of additional orders in FY25 and FY26. Government plans to tender 10GW of wind capacity annually from FY23-27 which might create opportunities for Suzlon. Company is net cash positive with a cash reserve of Rs 13 billion as of June 2024. Bear Case: Negative surprises in Wind Turbine Generator (WTG) execution and order inflows could pose risks to the company.

166,Twelve IPOs will compete to raise over $1 billion next week,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/twelve-ipos-will-compete-to-raise-over-1-billion-in-a-single-week-12815780.html,Stocks,2024-09-06 10:01:00+05:30,"Twelve initial public offers (IPOs), which include four from the main board and eight from small and medium enterprises (SMEs), are looking to raise over $1 billion or Rs 8,600 crore in the coming week. Among the main board IPOs, the four firms that will compete for investor attention are Bajaj Housing Finance, which will raise around Rs 6,560 crore, Tolins Tyres (Rs 230 crore), Kross Ltd (Rs 500 crore) and P N Gadgil Jewellers (Rs 1,100 crore). Another main board IPO, Western Carriers India, is likely to open soon though the company is yet to announce the details in terms of the issue opening and closing dates. While Bajaj Housing Finance, Tolins Tyres and Kross Ltd will open for subscription on September 9 and close on September 11, P N Gadgil Jeweller IPO will open on September 10 and close on September 12.  Apurva Sheth, Head of Market Perspectives and Research at SAMCO Securities, highlights several factors driving the positive trend in India's primary market. The current market buoyancy is fueled by broad investor participation with retail investors eager to capitalise on attractive listing gains, spurred by the strong performance of the secondary market -- Nifty is up 15.71 percent in the current calendar year till date. Additionally, robust liquidity among both domestic and foreign institutional investors has significantly bolstered the IPO market pipeline. Incidentally, the grey market premiums (GMP) for these firms are also surging. Bajaj Housing Finance GMP is trading at Rs 51 a share, up 73 percent from its upper end price band of Rs 70 a share, Tolins Tyres GMP is trading 12 percent higher while P N Gadgil Jewellers IPO is trading over 37 percent higher. Among SME IPOs, four companies -- Gajanand International, Share Samadhan, Shubhshree Biofuels Energy and Aditya Ultra Steel -- will open for subscription on September 9 and close on September 11. Two firms -- Trafiksol ITS Technologies, SPP Polymer -- will open on September 10 and close on September 13 while another two -- Innomet Advanced Materials and Excellent Wires & Packaging -- will open on September 11 and close on September 13. These firms will raise between Rs 12-45 crore each through their public issues. The recent past has seen IPOs attracting huge subscriptions. Among main board IPOs in August, the average subscription was over 75 times, while the average for 2024 so far stands at 66 times. For SME IPOs, the average subscription in August reached 290 times, with a year-to-date average of over 259 times. The strong subscription across IPOs has been driven by robust participation from retail, institutional, and foreign investors. Data from NSDL shows that while foreign investors have been net sellers in secondary markets, they have consistently invested in primary markets. In August, FIIs invested around Rs 12,872 crore, and so far in CY24, their investments in primary markets have totalled around Rs54,883 crore. Analysts note that most recent IPO offerings are emerging from high-growth, sunrise sectors, thereby attracting investors anticipating strong growth potential. This trend is expected to continue through the rest of 2024 and may extend into 2025, they say. â€śWith growing retail participation and renewed interest from FIIs, driven largely by evolving global macroeconomic conditions, the market environment seems favorable for several upcoming IPOs to finally make their debut on the bourses. The recent success of multiple listings is likely to generate even greater interest in the next wave of IPOs,â€ť says Nirav Karkera, Head of Research at Fisdom.

Cashing outÂ  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold $760 million worth of Bank of America sharesâ€”one of its largest holdingsâ€”over the past three sessions, according to regulatory filings on Friday.Â The sale of 18.7 million shares has further bolstered Berkshireâ€™s cash reserves, now standing at $277 billion, with a total of $6.97 billion raised from trimming its stake in the bank since July. Despite these sales, Berkshire remains Bank of America's largest shareholder, holdingÂ  an 11 percent stake valued at $34.7 billion. Change of plans OPEC+ has decided to delay its planned oil output increase for two months after prices tumbled due to weak demand and abundant supply. Key coalition members opted not to proceed with the scheduled hike of 180,000 barrels per day in October, according to a Bloomberg report. As news of the pause broke, oil prices rose by over 1 percent. The shiftÂ follows disappointing economic data from China and the US, the worldâ€™s largest oil consumers, which had pushed crude prices below $73 a barrel earlier in the week, hitting their lowest point since late 2023. While the dip in prices offers some relief to consumers grappling with inflation, it remains too low for countries like Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members to meet their fiscal needs. Relentless delays According to Reuters on Wednesday, the White House is reportedly close to announcing that President Joe Biden will block the Japanese company's $15 billion bid for US Steel, citing national security concerns. The deal is facing growing bipartisan opposition ahead of theÂ US presidential elections, with a powerful labor union also opposing the takeover of Pennsylvania-basedÂ US Steel, a key player in a swing state crucial for both Democrats and Republicans. While both companies aim to finalize the deal by year-end, its sensitivity is heightened by the close US-Japan alliance and Japan's position as the largest foreign investor in the US. Fear unlocked JPMorgan hasÂ snapped its buy recommendation on Chinese stocks, citing concerns over potential risks of a second tariff war after the US elections in November and growing unease aboutÂ the country's economic outlook. The brokerageÂ downgraded China's rating to ""neutral"" from ""overweight"" andÂ suggested investors shift focus to markets like India, Mexico, and Saudi Arabia. China's economic growth is falteringâ€”by its own high standardsâ€”and the country is struggling to draw in global investors, who are increasingly favoring other emerging markets like India. Coming Together The merger of two state-backed Chinese brokerages to form a sector leader with $230 billion in assets marks a significant step in Beijing's effort to consolidate the $1.7 trillion brokerage industry amid tough market conditions, according to analysts. Shanghai-based Guotai Junan Securities is set to acquire its rival, Haitong Securities, through a share swap, as announced by both firms on Thursday. The deal is pending regulatory and shareholder approvals. Once finalised, the merged entityâ€”boasting total assets of 1.6 trillion yuan ($225.6 billion)â€”will surpass Citi Securities to become China's largest brokerage.

The company launched the Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) last week on August 29. CLSA has given an ""outperform"" call on Prestige Estates, raising the target price to Rs 2,380 per share. The recent equity fundraising by the company is expected to significantly scale up both its residential and annuity businesses. CLSA believes that this move addresses the market's concerns regarding growth visibility, while also easing worries about rising debt levels, warranting a re-rating of the stock. In July, the realtor had taken approval of its shareholders to raise capital by way of public or private offerings including through a QIP to eligible investors through an issuance of equity shares or other eligible securities for an amount not exceeding Rs 5,000 crore. A Prestige Estates board fundraising committee approved the allocation of 2.98 crore equity shares at an issue price of Rs 1,674 apiece to eligible institutional investors. The issue price was at a discount of 4.62 percent on the floor price of Rs 1,755.09 per share fixed by the panel. Prestige Estates is one of the leading real estate developers in the country. It has a presence across six major cities and other urban centres. The company has an ongoing and upcoming project portfolio comprising 108 projects across various segments. Also Read |Â Stock Radar: KEC, Ashoka Buildcon, NLC India, Baazar Style Retail in focus According to the FY24 business portfolio, the company has completed 150 residential projects. Currently, it has 37 ongoing projects and 30 projects under the planning stage. The company's portfolio is balanced across different assets. In Q1FY25, its sales amounted to Rs 3,030 crore, supported by healthy collections of Rs 2,916 crore. Average realisations increased to Rs 11,934 per square foot for apartments, villas, and commercial spaces, and Rs 7,285 per square foot for plots. Prestige Estates stock ended 4 percent lower at Rs 1,785 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in the previous session. The stock has gained around 50 percent so far this year, outperforming Nifty's returns of 15 percent. In the past 12 months, the counter has zoomed 181 percent, more than doubling investors' capital. In comparison, Nifty rose 28 percent during this period.

179,"Technical View: Nifty fails to hold gains, slips below 25,150; recommends buy on dips",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/technical-view-nifty-fails-to-hold-gains-slips-below-25150-recommends-buy-on-dips-12815290.html,Stocks,2024-09-05 16:08:00+05:30,"The Nifty 50 index extended its losing streak on the second consecutive session on September 5 with Nifty falling below 25,150 ahead of upcoming US economic data. The index opened on a positive note, but as the day progressed, it erased all the gains and turned red, closing near to day's low. At close, Nifty was down 53.60 points or 0.21 percent at 25,145.10. Top Nifty gainers included Titan Company, LTIMindtree, Wipro, BPCL, and ITC, while losers were Coal India, Britannia Industries, Cipla, Dr Reddy's Labs, and Reliance Industries. On the sectoral front, selling was seen in auto, energy, and realty, while buying was seen in the bank, metal, IT, and media. The broader indices outperformed and hit record high in today's session. Nifty midcap 100 index rose 0.4 percent, and Nifty smallcap 100 index added 1 percent. ""Nifty opened gap up today, but witnessed profit booking during the course of the day to close in the red, down 50 points. On the daily charts we can observe that after the gap down in the previous trading session the price structure has weakened,"" said Jatin Gedia â€“ Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. ""The uptrend is still intact. However, there is high probability of a consolidation within the range of 25000 â€“ 25350 over the next few trading sessions. Dips towards the support zone 25100- 25050 should be used as a buying opportunity. On the upside, immediate hurdle is placed at 25300 â€“ 25350,"" he added. The Bank Nifty index also opened higher and touched a high of 51,636.75 during the day. However, selling at higher level erased some of the intraday gains to close with marginal gains at 51,473.05. ""The Bank Nifty outperformed today and closed in the green today. The Banking sector stood out after underperforming in the recent days. We expect the Bank Nifty to take the lead going ahead and expect levels of 51900 â€“ 52000 from short term perspective. The crucial support zone is placed in the range 51100 â€“ 51000,"" Gedia said.
