The promoters are working with investment bank Nomura to scout for buyers for their stake in Indiaâ€™s fifth largest drugmaker, the people cited above said, requesting anonymity. Alkem holds a dominant position in the areas of anti-infectives, gastrointestinal, pain management drugs and supplements. It also has a growing portfolio of products for the treatment of chronic conditions such as diabetes, neurology, cardiology, dermatology, and urology. The company and its banker have reached out to private equity firms such as KKR, Blackstone and EQT, among others, to gauge their interest in acquiring a substantial stake, possibly a controlling one in the listed company. The people cited added that the sale of a controlling stake is dependent on the valuation the promoters get, and they may not go through with the sale if the valuations are not attractive enough. Some family members may continue to stay invested in the company,Â the peopleÂ said. Alkem, founded in 1973 by Samprada Singh and his brother Basudeo, is now led by third-generation family member Sandeep Singh, grandson of the founder. Currently, promoters hold a 56.38 percent stake in Alkem, which is worth around Rs 42,283 crore as of Alkemâ€™s closing price on Wednesday. A large stake acquisition would trigger a mandatory open offer under SEBI norms, requiring the buyer to buyÂ an additional 26 percent stake from public shareholders at an estimated cost of about Rs 19,500 crore.

KKR and EQT declined to comment. Biggest PE deal in the pharma space The promoter stake sale in Alkem, if it goes through, will be the biggest private equity buyout in the pharma space, with the promoter stake itself being worth almost $5 billion, and among the biggest PE deals in India. Last year, the Hameid family of Cipla Ltd explored selling its 33.48 percent stake in one of Indiaâ€™s top pharma companies. PE firms such as Blackstone evinced interest to buy the Hameid family's stake for as much as $3.8 billion but talks eventually collapsed due to difference in valuations between the parties.

YES Bank's stake sale stuck as RBI concerned with majority ownership by foreign bank,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/yes-banks-stake-sale-stuck-as-rbi-not-comfortable-with-foreign-banks-majority-ownership-12820279.html,general," September 12, 2024 / 15:21   ","The stake sale of domestic lender YES Bank is stuck as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is not comfortable with the majority ownership by a foreign bank, person aware of the development said. ""SMBC is directly negotiating with RBI on this, but the central bank not willing to relent on ownership control,"" person cited above said. He added that Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (SMBC) is showing lot of interest in the bank but talks have currently hit a roadblock because the Japanese group are very firm on acquiring 51 percent. This is expected to delay the stake sale in YES Bank, which was earlier expected to be completed by fourth quarter of the current financial year. On August 1, Moneycontrol citing sources reported that RBI has asked investors seeking a controlling stake in Yes Bank to reconsider their demands, including acquiring and retaining a majority stake, potentially prolonging the deal process. “After the initial discussions with the regulator, potential bidders have been asked to review their stance on certain important deal terms,” one of the people said, requesting anonymity. The investors have made two key requests, according to the people cited on August 1. First, investors want to hold a 51 percent stake in the bank perpetually. “The incoming investors are not keen to dilute their holding in the bank less than 51 percent stake at any point in time,” said a person aware of the matter earlier. However, bank licensing norms require promoters to reduce their stake to 26 percent within 15 years of starting operations. To address this, the RBI has proposed a gradual glide path for investors to reduce their stake in YES Bank over time, indicating that maintaining a perpetual 51 percent holding may not be possible, the person said. According to media reports, SBI has placed its 24 percent stake in Yes Bank on the block. Other banks, including Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Bank, and HDFC Bank, collectively own 7.4 percent of the bank. PE investors Carlyle and Advent collectively own about 14 percent of Yes Bank.

"Correction in 'narrative' theme signals shifting preferences towards defensives, says KIE",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/correction-in-narrative-theme-signals-shifting-preferences-towards-defensives-says-kie-12820395.html,general," September 12, 2024 / 15:03   ","Kotak Institutional Equities believes the recent correction in 'narrative' driven themes- largely PSU sectors like railways, construction and defence-- hints towards a shift inÂ preference for defensives, which have supported headline indices. In the past week, the rally in PSU named cooled down significantly, with the BSE PSU index slipping nearly 4 percent. On the other side of the spectrum, defensive plays are seeing increased traction as the BSE FMCG and the BSE Healthcare indices gained around 2 percent in the past week. KIE attributes this defensive rally to a pullback from high-beta and 'narrative' stocks as investors adopt a risk-off approach in response to global uncertainties. As for the risk off mode, the brokerageÂ identifies the recent slew of data warning towards a slowdown in the US,Â ongoing stagnation in China's economic policies and theÂ continued lackluster performance of the Eurozone economy as the culprits. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action Even as this risk-off sentiment is prompting investors to look towards fundamentals, KIE also warned against the stiff valuations of the defensive stocks, which pose further challenges to portfolio construction.Â WhileÂ the possibility of a gradual recovery in volumes of consumer staples started gathering pace about 2-3 quarters back, it is yet to bloom into reality. Similarly, it also remains to be seen if the much-anticipated recovery in demand for IT services would be strong enough to justify the sharp re-rating in their multiples, the firm stated. Moving to the PSU space,Â KIEÂ believesÂ that most of the â€˜narrativeâ€™ stocks trade at inflated valuations, driven by unrealistic growth and profitability assumptions.Â Highlighting the risks involved with this segment of the market, KIE reiterated that many of these 'narrative' stocks remain disconnected from fundamentals and could be vulnerable to further correction.

Dhan displaces Paytm Money to enter the list of top 10 stock broking platforms,https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/dhan-displaces-paytm-money-to-enter-the-list-of-top-10-stock-broking-platforms-article-12820106.html,general," September 12, 2024 / 12:08   ","Dhan, led by former Paytm executive Pravin Jadhav, emerged as the tenth largest stock broking app in the country in August, knocking Paytm Money out of the Top 10 list, by adding 60,000 investors during the month. The August additions took the count of its active users to 7.4 lakh, National Stock Exchange (NSE) data shows. Founded in 2021, Dhan is one of the newest brokers to break into the top 10. It added around 50,000 active investors every month since April, cumulatively adding close to 3 lakh users in the past five months. Dhan is in talks to raise 100 million in funding at a $1.2 billion valuation. Previously, it was valued at around $150 million. On the other hand, Paytm Money continues to slide. The Noida-based firm lost 17,500 customers in August. It now has around 7.3 lakh active investors. The exchanges consider someone an active investor if they have done at least one trade in the past year. There are around 5 crore active investors in the country, according to the exchange data. Paytm Money has been losing more than 10,000 active investors every month since April, cumulatively losing 60,000 customers. Among the top 25 stock broking apps, only four saw a drop in active investors in August. Paytm Money was the only app among top 10 to lose customers and dropped off the list after almost two years. The regulatory restriction on Paytmâ€™s associate company resulted in leadership churn, including Paytm Money CEO Varun Sridhar being replaced by Rakesh Singh in May. At its peak, Paytm Money had more than 8 lakh active investors. Share.Marketâ€™s rapid rise PhonePe's Share.Market continues to grow at a blistering pace, breaking into the top 25 trading and investment apps. It crossed 2 lakh active investors in August to emerge as the 21st largest broking platform. The company had only 49,000 active investors in April, registering a four times growth in five months. It added 41,000 users in the past month. Angel One seems on track to take over Zerodha as the second largest stock broking firm in the country within the next three months. In August, Zerodha had 79 lakh active investors, while Angel One had 71 lakh. Angel One added double the number of active investors every month compared to Zerodha. In August, it added more than 1.6 lakh investors, while Zerodha added only 80,000. This has been a consistent trend since the beginning of this year. The market leader Groww has been adding more than 4 lakh active investors a month and now has close to 1.2 crore users.

Why PM Modi’s visit to CJI Chandrachud’s residence for Ganpati Puja has sparked row?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/why-pm-modis-visit-to-cji-chandrachuds-residence-for-ganpati-puja-has-sparked-row-12820397.html,general," September 12, 2024 / 14:43   ","Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud’s residence for Ganpati puja has sparked a controversy, with several prominent politicians and lawyers criticising the move. Modi was on September 11 seen participating in a puja at Chandrachud’s residence following which questions were raised over CJI’s ability to deliver a fair judgement. Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut said, ""Ganpati festival is going on, people visit each other's houses. I don't have the information regarding how many houses PM visited so far. But he went to CJI's residence and they performed 'Aarti' together.” Raut also raised doubts if the Uddhav Thackeray faction of Sena would get justice under Chandrachud and suggested him to distance himself from an ongoing case – where Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sunil Prabhu has challenged the Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar’s ruling. The ruling had declared the Eknath Shinde-led faction as the real Shiv Sena. According to Raut, the Chief Justice should recuse himself from the case as his 'relations' with the head of the central government are 'openly visible'. Reacting to PM Modi’s visit, senior advocate and former Additional Solicitor General (ASG), Indira Jaising said that the Chief Justice of India has compromised the separation of powers between the executive and judiciary. She urged the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) to condemn the event. “Lost all confidence in the independence of the CJI,” Jaising wrote on social media platform X. Echoing similar sentiments, senior Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan said it was shocking that CJI Chandrachud allowed Modi to visit him at his residence for a private meeting. “Sends a very bad signal to the judiciary which is tasked with the responsibility of protecting fundamental right of citizens from the executive and ensuring that the government acts within bounds of Constitution. That is why there has to be an arms length separation between the executive and judiciary,” he wrote. In another social media post, Bhushan quoted the ‘Code of Conduct for Judges’, “A Judge should practice a degree of aloofness consistent with the dignity of his office. There should be no act or omission by him which is unbecoming of the high office he occupies and the public esteem in which that office is held.” BJP defends PM’s visit: BJP MP Sambit Patra, addressing a press conference on September 12, slammed Opposition leaders for criticising Modi’s visit. He also hit out at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over his meeting with US Congresswoman Ilhan Omar. “If the Prime Minister is meeting the CJI, you have a problem, but if you are meeting anti-national people in the US, then there is no problem.” “Should the different pillars of democracy not converge? Should they be enemies? Should they have no courtesies towards each other?” Patra questioned. BJP leader Shehzad Poonawalla, in a post on X, said attending Ganesh puja is no crime and added that there are various instances when judiciary and politicians share stage. He was responding to the comments made by Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi over PM Modi-Chandrachud meet. ""After the festivities are over, hopefully the CJI will deem fit and be slightly freer to conclude the hearing on Maharashtra and the blatant disregard of Article 10 of the Constitution in Maharashtra. Oh wait, elections are round the corner anyway, it can be adjourned for another day,"" Chaturvedi tweeted. In a video, Chandrachud and his wife Kalpana Das were seen welcoming Modi at their house. Modi was then seen participating in the puja at their residence. The Prime Minister wore traditional Maharashtrian attire as he joined the celebrations at the CJI's residence. ""Joined Ganesh Puja at the residence of CJI, Justice DY Chandrachud Ji. May Bhagwan Shri Ganesh bless us all with happiness, prosperity and wonderful health,"" Modi said in a post on X.

If the security conditions had indeed improved, why is Delhi maintaining such an elaborate security ring in the region, said the former chief minister speaking at Aaj Tak's 'Panchayat' event on the banks of Srinagar's iconic Dal Lake. ""There never used to be so many forces during Amarnath Yatra... They (tourists) come like prisoners and are taken away like prisoners in caged buses,"" the National Conference chief said. Mincing no words, the veteran leader quipped that the current administrative setup in the union territory goes against the wishes of the popular will. â€œWhy is there no representation of Kashmiris in the higher echelons of administration. Are our people not capable to serve in important administrative positions? questioned Abdullah. Abdullah pointed out that despite having complete control over J&K for the past five years, the Centre had not managed to bring terrorism under control. The former Chief Minister cited the June terror attack on a bus carrying pilgrims in Reasi district to buttress his point. The veteran J&K politician said Article 370, which provided special status to the erstwhile state, would be restored in due time. ""We will achieve it one day, there is no hurry. India also took 200 years to become independent,"" Abdullah said. The Congress and the National Conference are jointly fighting the upcoming polls.Â The alliance was announced last month when Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge visited Gupkar, the residence of NC president Farooq Abdullah and vice president OmarÂ Abdullah.

OMCs to decide on fuel price cut if crude stays low for long: Petroleum Secy,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/omc-fuel-price-cut-windfall-tax-petroleum-secy-12820307.html,general," September 12, 2024 / 15:25   ","Petroleum Secretary Pankaj Jain has said on September 12 that India's oil marketing companies may consider lowering fuel prices, if in their assessment, the trend of international crude oil prices remains low for some more time. Windfall Tax Review? He also confirmed to CNBC-Awaaz in an interaction that the Oil Ministry has been in talks with the Finance Ministry regarding the windfall tax, and the Department of Revenue will take a final decision in this regard. Both ministries will continue to engage in this matter, he said. Shares of oil marketing companies IOC, HPCL and BPCL were trading with modest gains on September 12, during mid-dayÂ trade. Oil Price Cut Coming? Secretary Pankaj Jain acknowledged that oil prices have cooled off in the last 7-10 days, and it needs to be seen for how long global prices stay subdued, as it may not be prudent to decide based only on one week's price movement. ""We need time to see if this trend (in oil prices) can continue going forward, only then can we assess any impact. India's oil purchase in done keeping in mind a longer duration of oil price trend,"" he added. A decision on price cut of petrol and diesel by the state-run oil marketing companies (OMCs), however, would be taken after reviewing the Brent price for a few more weeks, according to energy analysts. Oil Price Trend BrentÂ crudeÂ futures for November were near $71.61 a barrel and U.S.Â crudeÂ futures for October were at $68.23 a barrel,Â in early trade on September 12. Brent crude - a benchmark for global prices - has slipped below $70 a barrel for the first time since 2021, and already, several analysts are forecasting a further weakness in crude prices. Citigroup and JPMorgan have put out projections which suggest oil may test $60 level in 2025. India To Welcome Higher Oil Output Regarding OPEC's decision on oil supply, Pankaj Jain said India wants the production of crude oil to rise, as demand from many countries such as ours remainsÂ intact. Earlier in the week, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cut its forecast for globalÂ oilÂ demand growth in 2024, and also trimmed its expectation for next year. This is the second consecutive downward revision by OPEC. IndiaÂ is the world's third largest oilÂ importer and consumer, meetingÂ over 80% of itsÂ oil requirement internationally. Pankaj Jain added that India will consider buying moreÂ oilÂ from Russia, if it offer cheaper rates. In July, India was the top buyer of RussianÂ oil, surpassing China.

Effective strategies to minimize long-term capital gains tax,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/effective-strategies-to-minimize-long-term-capital-gains-tax-12820121.html,general," September 12, 2024 / 13:18   ","Have you sold land, house or jewellery recently and are worried that your recent long-term capital gains will accrue tax? To minimize the impact of long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax on investments like securities and property, hereâ€™s how you can employ several strategies: Utilize the Rs. 1 Lakh Exemption: Each financial year, up to Rs. 1 lakh of LTCG is exempt from tax. By strategically timing the sale of investments, you can spread redemptions over two financial years, maximizing the use of this exemption in both years. This helps reduce the taxable portion of your gains, effectively lowering your tax liability. Invest in Tax-Friendly Securities: Consider investing in tax-efficient instruments such as equity-linked savings schemes (ELSS), equity-oriented hybrid funds, or tax-saving fixed deposits. ELSS, for instance, comes with a three-year lock-in period and qualifies for LTCG tax, allowing for potential tax savings. These tax-efficient instruments can help optimize your portfolio returns by reducing the overall tax impact. Set Off Capital Losses: One of the effective ways to minimize your LTCG tax liability is by setting off your capital losses against capital gains. Both short-term and long-term capital losses can be offset against long-term capital gains. By doing this, you reduce the taxable amount of your gains, which in turn lowers the tax you owe. This strategy is particularly useful for investors who have incurred losses in other parts of their portfolio. Leverage Indexation Benefit: When calculating LTCG, you can use the indexation benefit, which adjusts the purchase price of an asset for inflation. This adjustment lowers the amount of taxable gain, effectively reducing your tax liability. Indexation is especially beneficial for assets held over the long term, where inflation can significantly impact the purchasing power of money. Apply the Grandfathering Clause: The grandfathering clause, introduced when the LTCG tax on equity shares and equity mutual funds was reintroduced in 2018, allows investors to consider the market value of their investments as of January 31, 2018, as the acquisition cost. This means that gains accrued before this date are not subject to tax, which can considerably lower the taxable amount of LTCG and reduce the tax burden. By using these strategies, investors can optimize their investment returns while effectively managing and reducing their LTCG tax liabilities. These approaches not only provide tax benefits but also align with prudent financial planning and investment management.

How Anuj Rathi is bringing some of the Swiggy stories to Cleartrip to help you travel better,https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/how-anuj-rathi-is-bringing-some-of-the-swiggy-stories-to-cleartrip-to-help-you-travel-better-article-12820051.html,general," September 12, 2024 / 15:14   ","Anuj Rathi, who used to build products at food aggregator Swiggy and later at fintech player Jupiter, had earlier this year decided to explore the travel space with the plans to devise solutions that wouldÂ help Indians travel better. One of the first products he built for Flipkart-owned travel app Cleartrip, where he joined as chief business and growth officer, was a bus pass, taking a leaf out of his Swiggy playbook, where he had launched products like subscription programme 'Swiggy One'. The 'Bus Pass' is available for Rs 150 and travellers can make a maximum of five bookings and is valid for 90 days. ""IÂ was part of the team thatÂ launched Swiggy Super (a membership programme) and then Swiggy One. While I am hoping to use a lot of learnings from my Swiggy and Jupiter days, the sectors are very different. For a high-frequency category like e-commerce and quick commerce, memberships work better. For a lower-frequency category like travel, passes work better. These are tough constructs, yet we see a lot of healthy greenshoots for our Bus Pass,"" he said. Rathi said that there will not be a one-to-one product porting (from Swiggy and Jupiter) but there are a lot of ways in which they can get creative in travel. Cleartrip recorded 25-30 percent of its overall bus bookings through Bus Pass. Betting big on buses ""It (Bus Pass) was launched some three weeks back. And, we see a very strong demand from Tier-II cities,"" he said, sharing data around bus bookings on the travel app. Cleartrip had launched the bus category in April 2023 and has recorded a 150 percent growth with Indore-Bhopal, Bengaluru-Hyderabad, Indore-Pune, Chennai-Madurai and Coimbatore-Bengaluru emerging as the top routes with high repeat bookings. Buses on the app have registered the highest number of frequent travellers with 32 percent of users repeating their bookings in the last three months. Around 15 percent of users book buses at least three times within three months. Bus users are also highly value-conscious, with 75 percent of travellers using discount coupons while booking. ""If the customer has come and started using that pass, we think that that the customer will move all their bus journeys to us. I think it is going to be like a hockey stick growth. That's why some of these products have a lot of potential,"" he added. Rathi thinks buses and train segments have a lot of potential for OTAs to grow. ""There are like 4.3-4.4 lakh domestic customers that fly out of India. But for buses, there are like 45 lakh travellers. It is 10 times the size of flights. For trains, there are around 17-18 lakh customers. However, only five lakh of bus travellers bought tickets online. So, there are a lot of people who are still not buying it online. That's where we see the opportunity."" Once people get familiar with booking buses online, a lot of those customers will also move to flights and hotels.Â Cleartrip added the train segment on its platform recently. ""The online penetration of bookings for trains and buses has a lot of growth potential,"" he noted. Eye on festive season The travel platform is counting on the festive season. ""Compared to last year, destinations like Kolkata for Durga Puja are seeing a 10 percent increase in bookings, despite elevated (air) fares. So, both volume and value are seeing growth. For Diwali, we are seeing a very similar uptake. But a lot of people wait for the Big Billion Days to start so that some people will hold on to make their festive bookings,"" Rathi said. Flipkart's Big Billion Days, a festive shopping sale, will extend to the travel space too like last year with offers like domestic flights starting at Rs 999 or international flights at Rs 5,999. ""This time, we are partnering with a bunch of five-star hotels, marking a strong entry into the hotels segment. Five-star hotels will start at Rs 2,499. One of my favourite constructs (under BBD) is child flies free."" Last year, Cleartrip's flight bookings compared to a normal period versus BBD grew about 1.9 times, while hotels grew about three times, and bus bookings increased 1.8 times. ""This time, we are confident that we're going to overshoot all of them,"" he said. Travel diaries While travel is completely a new space for Rathi, he did some bit of tracking during the Covid years and that's when he saw the potential the sector holds. ""This is an intriguing industry that I've been tracking for a long time. When Covid happened, we saw a lot of changes across the world. I was visiting the Google office to look at the trends that seem to have fundamentally changed in India and how many of those trends had reversed. Travel stood out as a permanent opportunity and that stayed with me. And I kept tracking it,"" the Cleartrip executive said. When this opportunity came to him, it seemed like one of the best places to join and help India travel much better. ""I was at Swiggy at that time (during Covid) and our business went down, similar to travel. Even in quick commerce, food delivery, restaurant workers and delivery executives were not available. Most of all, consumers were very careful about allowing people in their homes. So, we were trying to think about how to reinvent ourselves. That was also the time we were looking at all the trends across which industries are going to go bust and which industries will boom,"" Rathi said. This is when travel caught his attention. ""EdTech, for example, had to boom. But we knew that it was not a permanent trend. Like once that settles, things will go back. But fintech, for instance, was a one-way trend. And that was a time like when I also started tracking travel, it seemed like a one-way trend. People came out and essentially the permanent shift happened with valuable experiences. I don't see things going down at all,"" he added. Rathi, however, pointed out that the travel sector in India remained fragmented. ""Hospitality is not that evolved in technology. I did not realise that one has to go 20 years back to programming languages to integrate in hospitality. That was surprising. The marketplace of hotels is not so straightforward to kind of just build a product and people will come. It is extremely detailed and there are so many nuances,"" he said.

Addressing Paytm's annual general meeting 2024 on September 12, where the new technology dominated the conversation, Sharma said the company was committed to leading the industry with its advanced AI capabilities. ""We, as a nation, have leapfrogged to become leaders in financial technology, and now we have the opportunity and obligation to extend that leadership into AI technology. Paytm aims to lead the industry with our advanced AI capabilities,” Sharma said. Talking about Paytm’s AI adoption, Sharma said its systems were operational in Japan as well, supporting risk management and fraud detection. ""Our risk management and fraud detection systems not only enhance our payment solutions in India but also support one of the largest mobile payment companies in Japan (PayPay), where we are also a potential shareholder. There is strong demand and high expectations for us to continue advancing our AI-powered risk management solutions,"" he said. Since 2023, the fintech major has been pushing for AI-powered systems to improve business efficiency. “Instead of expanding business functions, we are trying to add capabilities of machines and systems to the platform. The systems will continue to grow and this will create demand in a linear way of the number of people we need,” Sharma had said during a Q3 earnings call with analysts. At the AGM, he said early adoption of AI technologies would be crucial for companies aiming to stay ahead in a rapidly evolving landscape. ""We are still in the early stages of AI. Those who leverage it now will pave the way for long-term success,"" Sharma said. Stressing on the importance of AI in improving operational efficiency and reducing costs, the Paytm founder said, “Our goal is to harness these technologies to improve our core business operations and drive down expenses.” Sharma also discussed the broader implications of AI for the industry. He drew comparisons with historical technological shifts such as the transition from manual to automated systems, to illustrate AI’s potential impact. Paytm's AI shift has led to job cuts. In December, the fintech major laid off more than 1,000 employees from its operations, sales and engineering team.

This is the third death in IIT-Guwahati this year. IIT-Guwahati students have temporarily halted their protests that began after Bimlesh kumar's body was discovered in his hostel room on Monday. The institute's director, Devendra Jalihal, assured the students that their demands, including the resignations of additional faculty members, such as the vice-chairperson of the hostel affairs board and the associate deans of student and academic affairs, would be addressed. However, IIT-Guwahati authorities have yet to decide whether to accept the resignation of the dean of academic affairs, KV Krishna. The institute has also restricted media access to the campus. Kumar's father, Ras Bihari Ram Paswan, a CISF havildar stationed in Dhanbad, was quoted by TOI: ""There is clear negligence on the part of IIT-Guwahati. How could they be so ruthless towards a student who submitted a medical reason for poor attendance?"" Kumar had confided in his father that he was under stress and feared rustication. Director Jalihal has pledged to bring more flexibility to academic policies, including a review of the mandatory 75% attendance rule, by October 15. Students with backlogs will be allowed to participate in placements and internships, provided they clear their pending courses as soon as possible. Police have registered a case of unnatural death and have questioned several faculty members and students.

NCPCR made the observation while filing an affidavit in the apex court on a plea challenging Allahabad High Court's March 22 judgment striking down 'UP Board of Madarsa Education Act 2004'. The top child rights body reasoned that the education imparted to children in Madrasa is not comprehensive, and is therefore against the provisions of Right to Education Act, 2009. NCPCR also expressed concerns over the content of some madrasa textbooks, particularly those promoting “supremacy of Islam”, even as several non-Muslim children were also enrolled in madrasas in the states of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Importantly, the submission also states that the Taliban’s ideologies have been shaped by the teachings of the Darul Uloom Deoband Madrasa in Uttar Pradesh. Although madrasas are exempt from the provisions of the RTE Act, the NCPCR pointed out that children studying in these institutions are still entitled to the right to education under Article 21A of the Constitution.  The commission emphasized that this right has never been waived in any judicial decision or constitutional interpretation, adding that depriving children in madrasas of formal education undermines their fundamental right to equality before the law. The rights forum described the Uttar Pradesh Madarsa Education Act as a ""depriving tool,"" arguing that it strips children in minority institutions of their right to elementary education and related entitlements like midday meals, uniforms, and trained teachers. Because madrasas are exempt from the RTE Act, children studying there miss out on both formal schooling and the benefits guaranteed under the law, the commission explained. “It is a flagrant violation of a child’s constitutional right to education to impart instruction that is entirely in the context of religion and that does not adhere to the requirement of the RTE Act, 2009, or any other applicable laws. Innocent children suffer as a result of the religious subject of education becoming institutionalised in madrasas...The absence of formal education in these institutions deprives children of essential skills and knowledge necessary for their holistic development,” stated the child rights body.

It produces wind turbines and offers a range of solar energy solutions, such as solar irradiance assessment, land acquisition and approvals, infrastructure and power evacuation, supply chain, installation and commission and life cycle asset management.

India is turning into a GCC powerhouse,https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/india-home-to-over-1700-gccs-export-revenue-up-over-40-to-64-6-billion-in-fy24-says-report-article-12819405.html,general," September 11, 2024 / 13:54   ","India had more than 1,700 global capability centres (GCCs) and their export revenue rose more than 40 percent from the previous year to $65 billion in the FY24, a report has said. The fast-growing sector employed over 19 million people during the period, the report released by IT industry body Nasscom and consulting firm Zinnov on September 11 said, terming India as the GCC Capital of the world. In FY23, India's GCCs’ revenue was up 11.4 percent at $46 billion, with an employee count of over 16.6 lakh people, data from the Economic Survey 2023-24 shows. “The last five years have seen a rapid expansion in the GCC ecosystem and India remains well-positioned for future growth through prioritisation on skills development, cybersecurity, and progressive policy frameworks,” the report said. Between FY19 and FY24, more than 400 new GCCs were set up in the country, the report said. At a time when artificial intelligence skills and demand are gaining prominence, the report showed that the talent pool in India is over 120,000 such professionals. A GCC is a dedicated offshore unit a company sets up in a foreign country to in-source IT and related business functions. The average GCC talent has expanded by almost 24 percent since FY19 and is estimated at over 1,130 employees in FY24, the report said. Over 90 percent of the GCCs operate as multi-functional centres, supporting technology, operations, and product engineering. The information technology (IT) and business process management (BPM) sectors grew faster in percentage terms but on a smaller base. GCCs within the IT segment grew 30 percent to $9.7 billion, while the BPM segment grew about 27 percent to $10.7 billion in FY23. The Economic Survey said hiring in the IT sector slowed down considerably in the last financial year. Even if there was no further decline, it was unlikely to pick up significantly, it said. “While the initial wave of GCC growth was driven by large enterprises, more mid-market enterprises and unicorns are also setting up GCCs in India,” the report said. Around 40 global unicorns have an India GCC presence as of 2024 but the Americas continue their dominance with over 1,000 centres. GCCs are also expanding in tier 2 and 3 cities, with over 220 units in cities such as Ahmedabad, Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram and Coimbatore. Also read: IT companies set up dedicated GCC Strategic Business Units as demand booms Coming of Age The report highlights that almost 53 percent of the GCCs are in the portfolio and transformation hub stages. ER&D GCCs, contributing $36.4 billion in revenue, have grown 1.3 times faster than the overall GCC growth rate, indicating a shift towards higher-value work, the report said. Global roles in India have expanded over the past five years, with more than 6,500 such positions. This includes more than 1,100 women leaders. Nearly a quarter of global engineering roles are now based in India, with industries like aerospace, efence and semiconductor focusing on next-generation technologies. At a time when the push is being made at a policy level, semiconductor firms are increasingly establishing product teams in India. Also read: By 2030, GCCs will bring $121 bn in revenue, driving 3.5% of India’s GDP Outlook The report said that the GCC market in India is estimated to grow to $99-105 billion by 2030, with the number of GCCs reaching 2,100-2,200 and headcount rising to 25-28 lakh. “They (GCCs) can unlock new growth by monetizing ""India to India"" services, leveraging local market insights, and expanding their domestic footprint,” the report said. More mature GCCs are developing expertise in full-stack development, AI, IoT, and cybersecurity to create advanced solutions for global and emerging markets. “As we look ahead to 2030, we expect that 70% of Fortune 500 companies will be expanding their presence to India. The writing is on the wall - India is no longer just participating in the global tech narrative – we're authoring it,"" Zinnov CEO Pari Natarajan said in the release.

HDFC Bank in talks with global lenders to offload $1 billion in loans,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/hdfc-bank-in-talks-with-global-lenders-to-offload-1-billion-in-loans-12820123.html,general," September 12, 2024 / 12:37   ","India's largest private lender HDFC Bank is in discussion with major global banks to offload loans worth as much as Rs 8,400 crore ($1 billion) in an effort to cut down the size of its credit book and improve its ratio in relation to deposits, Bloomberg reported citing sources. The report said the bank is in talks with Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., among a few others. ICICI Bank Ltd. is also involved in the talks, one of the people told Bloomberg. The proposed loan portfolio sales, with terms yet to be finalized, would take place through a debt instrument known as pass through certificates, the people added. JPMorgan declined to comment. HDFC, Barclays, Citi and ICICI didn’t reply to requests for comment. Indian banks are under increased regulatory pressure to improve their credit to deposit ratios — a measure of how much of a bank’s deposits are being lent out to borrowers. The loan sales will help HDFC improve that ratio, which has worsened in recent years as growth in credit has outpaced deposits. The lender is also in separate discussions with local asset management companies to sell as much as Rs 10,000 crore of loans, Bloomberg News reported earlier. It already sold a Rs 5,000 crore loan portfolio to an undisclosed buyer in June. HDFC’s credit to deposit ratio stood at 104% at the end of March, higher than the 85% to 88% rate in the previous three fiscal years, according to ICRA Ltd., a unit of Moody’s Ratings. The ratio rose following HDFC Bank’s merger last year with mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corp. Its gross advances grew to Rs 24.9 lakh crore as of June 2024, a 52.6% increase compared to the previous year, according to data from the bank. Indian banks’ deposits grew 11% annually through August 23, slower than loan growth of 14%, according to the latest data from the Reserve Bank of India. The deposit growth has been lagging credit for some time, which “may potentially expose the system to structural liquidity issues,” RBI said in August. With Bloomberg inputs "

Democratising Investing: Share.Market Levels the Playing Field with Stock Collections,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/brand-connect/democratising-investing-share-market-levels-the-playing-field-with-stock-collections-12818316.html,general," September 12, 2024 / 15:22   ","The Indian stock market surged to an all-time high on 30th Aug, with the Nifty 50 closing at 25,235. This is no ordinary bull run. According to several experts, India is being considered the best long-term equity market globally. Driving this bull market is the confluence of factors: growing retail participation, robust domestic demand, demographics of an aspirational population, digitisation that democratizes access, the strong India Inc growth story, and enthusiastic fund flows. Fortunately, industry bodies have done a great job of educating the public, resulting in record numbers of retail investors. Demat accounts have crossed 16 crores, with over 42 lakh new accounts added in June 2024 itself. Investors have also begun to understand that the earlier they begin their investments, and the longer they stay invested, the better their returns look over time thanks to the compounding effect. In fact, recent data shows that 83% of new investors who have registered in the past three years are under the age of 40. While this is great news, it is also true that there is a lot of untapped potential.Â  A recent SEBI study shows that just 27% of Indiaâ€™s population is considered financially literate, which means that many novice investors struggle to navigate the markets often due to paucity of time or lack of skill set. The reality of Indian markets is that even seasoned investors struggle to stay ahead. With over 5,000 listed companies, the sheer volume of information, the constant fluctuations in stock prices, and the technical jargon can easily prove overwhelming, especially for those just starting out. Ultimately, it's not just about finding access to reliable information, but having it presented in a way that is clear, actionable, and relevant. Retail investors, therefore, need tools that simplify investments and help them make informed decisions without spending hours on research and analysis.

"How does 30 year old Sameer holiday at multiple countries with his wife every year, while paying his home loan?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/mc-buzz/how-does-30-year-old-sameer-holiday-at-multiple-countries-with-his-wife-every-year-while-paying-his-home-loan-article-12809979.html,general,,"We've all dreamed of a life where we can take lavish holidays, own our homes, and have enough investments to give our kids a great education, and ourselves a glowing retirement. And while these visions are great for the vision board, they also need some effective real world actions to bring them to fruition.Â  For most of us, when we think of earning more, we are limited by our jobs. Even if you're a top performer with a stellar record, a promotion each year is unlikely, and not something you can realistically factor into your financial plans. Moonlighting on the side is also out of the question for most people in their 30s â€“ whether its corporate policies, or it being the decade when you're already pushing yourself to the limit anyway.Â  As you've probably guessed, the third, and most reliable option is a good investment strategy. For most new investors though, even the words 'investment strategy' can prove stressful. The great news is that they don't need to be.Â  In this article, we're covering 7 common sense strategies that can give your income (and your financial plan) a serious boost. In order to make these strategies even easier to understand and apply, we're going to use the example of someone just like you.Â  Sameer Mehta is a 30 year old software consultant who is on the high potential track at his job at an MNC. He has recently married his college sweetheart, and isÂ  travelling the world with her. He also bought a home this year, and wants to pay it off before the age of 40. As someone who is indebted to his parents for his education, he wants to ensure that, he too, can provide for an excellent education for his children. Of course, he's been advised to start saving for retirement right away, and is already dreaming of a glowing retirement period when he and his wife, free from the encumbrances of jobs and responsibilities, can indulge in hobbies and interests, as well as take in the frequent trips abroad.Â  Let's see how we can help Sameer make the most of his investment potential during his 30s, so he can achieve all he dreams of.Â  Strategy #1: Set Clear Financial GoalsÂ  Since Sameer has several goals (paying off a home loan, funding childrenâ€™s education, and securing a comfortable retirement), as a first step, he needs to get clear on his goals, and the monetary numbers associated with them. For most people, the problem begins with coming up with the right number. While he can estimate what these things will cost at today's prices, how could Sameer possibly know, with accuracy, how much his retirement will cost 30 years from now?Â  For this, Sameer needs to account for inflation.Â  While he can't accurately predict the future (no one can!), he can look to the past for clues. If we look at this chart, we can see that India's consumer inflation rate is at a comfortable 3.54% in July 2024. The highest peak on this chart is Nov 2013, when the inflation rate hit a high of 12.17%. However, for the purpose of planning, you're better off looking at the average and mean. Even if Sameer doesn't have a calculator handy, he can see at a glance that we've spent more time between 6-8% inflation than outside of it. Let's say he uses these numbers to define his inflation range. He already knows how much moneyÂ  a comfortable retirement, or his children's education will cost at today's prices. He then uses this simple inflation calculator to arrive at his target - for both ends of his inflation range. We encourage you to give it a try too - the results are bound to be enlightening.Â  While these numbers look very daunting, now that Sameer knows what the numerical value of his goals are, he can decide which of his goals matter most to him, and can prioritise accordingly.Â  Strategy #2: Live Beneath Your MeansÂ  Like most 20 year olds, Sameer was always short of money because his first salary was a small one. Back then, he knew down to the last Rs 100, how much he had spent and where. But since his last two promotions, money hasn't been so tight, and neither has Sameer's monitoring of his expenditure.Â  This actually works in Sameer's favour because when he looks at his spending critically, he is sure to find pockets that he can tap into - places where he is spending more than he should. Also, Sameer knows that budgeting doesn't need to be difficult, or time consuming. Most banks offer spend analysis tools that allow him to easily identify areas in his spending that need adjustment. Routing these savings into investment is also made easy through opening a Demat account.Â  Sameer also needs to understand his debt. Instead of allowing some of his credit card purchases to roll over to the next month, if he disciplines himself to paying the credit card bill in full each month, he pays zero interest. Plus, he trains himself to spend within his means. In the same vein, if he makes regular prepayments into his home loan, or if he asks the home loan provider to increase his EMI, he is able to realise incredible savings in interest. So much so, that Sameer loves asking for the amortisation chart before and after he makes the payments, for the joy of looking at how much interest each prepayment saves him!Â  These are easy steps you can take too. Use your bank's spend analysis tool, or look for one online that allows you to upload your bank and credit card statements. Then, look critically at your credit card spending, and train yourself to pay more of the credit card bill each month, till you get to the point where you're paying it in full. Your future self will thank you.Â  Remember: no saving is too small. Especially when you invest it.Â  Strategy #3: Leverage the Power of CompoundingÂ  By now, Sameer has been advised by numerous people that the earlier he starts investing, the better. However, Sameer hasn't done the math himself. Let's look at his numbers. Let's assume he wants to retire at 60.Â  If he begins investing at the age of 30, with just Rs 10,000 per month, invested in an instrument that gives him a return of just 8%, by the time he's 60, he'll be sitting at a corpus of Rs 1.50 Crore. If he starts at the age 35, that number drops to Rs 95.74 Lakhs. At 40, it drops to just Rs 59.29 Lakhs and at 45, we're down to just Rs 34.85 Lakhs.Â  That's the power of compounding.Â  Now let's say he's invested wisely, and is earning a return of 10% (which beats his inflation range), then these numbers look even better. If he begin at age 30, he's looking at a corpus of Rs 2.28 Crore, and starting at 45, we're down to just Rs 41.79 Lakhs.Â  Strategy #4: Start Small and Grow as You GoÂ  You'll notice that at an ROI of 8%, the difference between investing at age 45 and 30 is 4.3x. At an ROI of 10%, that number jumps to 5.45x. That's the power of product selection.Â  For Sameer, choosing the right products can be daunting when he's swimming in a sea of information online. Choosing the right investments, by listening to the right advice can make a significant difference, as we've seen from the example above. While building his financial literacy will take time and experience, he can still make a good start by choosing reliable experts.Â  Once Sameer has more experience under his belt and is seeking diversification, Research Ideas available with his stock broker cover Equity Fundamentals, Technical, Currency and Derivatives, which can give himthe edge when investing across financial asset classes. However, if Sameerâ€™s looking for a more hands-off approach to investing, the Stock baskets can help him identify and invest in theme basedtheme-based portfolios that are backed by extensive technical and fundamental analyses.Â  Strategy #5: Create Multiple Income StreamsÂ  While Sameer is happy with a strategy that gives him growth (which is usually the main point of an investment strategy), he also needs to prioritise income producing investments that can supercharge his growth strategy and set off multipliers where his income is concerned.Â  Income producing investments - be they dividend paying stocks, or bonds, or InVITs and REITs, or corporate deposits, or even mutual funds that pay consistent income at regular intervals; leveraging these can help Sameer create incredible multipliers long term.Â  Fortunately, all of these asset classes are available through tools with his stock broker, which gives him the additional convenience of checking in on his investments from anywhere, and at any time. With a little discipline, if he routes his investment income back into other growth and income generating investments, he's setting into motion a massive multiplier effect where each year, he's better able to beat inflation, and create additional income streams.Â  This positive feedback loop creates true financial freedom. Now Sameer can realistically plan to take an annual holiday abroad, without disturbing his investments. He can now be confident that he can afford a second home. He now knows that he can pay for an Ivy League education when his kids come of age. He also knows that retirement, when it happens, will actually be fun because he's already got multiple income streams that are independent from his job.Â  Strategy #6: Protect Your Prime Earning YearsÂ  While Sameer is busy creating additional income streams and growing his investments, the best laid plans can be torn asunder by an illness, an accident, or even job loss. This is why his emergency fund, and his insurance policies are his biggest assets when things go wrong.Â  Let's start with emergency funds: how much money Sameer needs is determined by how much his monthly outflow is, and how much (and what type) of insurance he has. Generally, having a six month buffer can give most people enough time to find a new job, recover from an accident, and bounce back from an illness.Â  Income Protection Insurance is a great way for Sameer to safeguard his income in the event of unforeseen circumstances. By providing a steady income stream, these plans will ensure that Sameer's family can maintain their lifestyle, and that they aren't financially stressed during difficult times. Moreover, some income protection plans also provide debt coverage and inflation protection.Â  Medical inflation is holding steady at 14% at the moment. Which means that Sameer needs to ask himself some crucial questions:Â Can his health insurance policy cope?Â Does he have health insurance of his own, aside from the group health insurance cover his employer provides?Â Answering these questions will be an investment Sameer's family will be grateful for, if the worst happens.Â  Consider making this investment yourself - after all, it's better to have something and not need it, than the other way around.Â  Strategy #7: Be FlexibleÂ  This final strategy ensures that when opportunity knocks, Sameer is ready. Every successful investor has a story of a windfall that occurred because they were in the right place at the right time. As Sameer's financial literacy grows, so will his ability to consume financial news, and identify investment opportunities that are headed his way.Â  If he doesn't have the time to monitor the markets himself, relying on trusted experts is always a strong strategy. Between his stock brokerâ€™s app and the Research Recommendations, Research Ideas and stock baskets, Sameer can prime himself to be at just the right place, when that once-in-a-lifetime opportunity presents itself.Â  Conclusion As we saw in with Sameer, navigating your 30s is all about finding balance: between ambition and reality, between work and personal life, and ultimately, between earning and investing. The power of compounding, disciplined savings, and smart financial strategies can transform your financial future. By setting clear goals, living within your means, leveraging the right investment tools, and staying flexible, youâ€™re not just securing your financial stability; youâ€™re building the life youâ€™ve always envisioned. Remember, itâ€™s not just about working harder; itâ€™s about making your money work harder for you. Whether youâ€™re taking the first steps like Sameer is, or refining your investment approach, the time to start is now. With the right strategies and tools at your disposal, you can achieve financial freedom, not just in retirement, but throughout your life.Â  The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

'We don't eat cats and dogs': German foreign ministry to Trump after his pet-eating claims,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/we-dont-eat-cats-and-dogs-german-foreign-ministry-to-trump-after-his-pet-eating-claims-12820285.html,World," September 12, 2024 / 13:08   ","Germany's foreign ministry mocked U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's false assertion about immigrants eating pets in a post on the social platform X on Wednesday while pushing back against his criticism of German energy policy. Trump amplified a false claim in Tuesday's debate with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris that numerous Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were stealing residents' pets or taking wildlife from parks for food. He also attacked Harris' bid to move the country towards what she says will be a more diverse and sustainable mix of energy sources, saying Germany had tried and failed to give up fossil fuels. ""Like it or not: Germany's energy system is fully operational, with more than 50% renewables. And we are shutting down â€“ not building â€“ coal & nuclear plants. Coal will be off the grid by 2038 at the latest,"" the foreign ministry said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""PS: We also don't eat cats and dogs. #Debate2024"" The economy ministry, which is also run by the Greens party, retweeted the post, saying: ""New coal-fired power plants? No way!"" Chancellor Olaf Scholz has not directly endorsed Harris but praised her in July as a ""competent and experienced politician who knows exactly what she is doing"" and who could well win the U.S. election. Germany was a frequent focus of Trump's ire during his 2017-21 term as president due to its trade surplus with the United States and low spending on defence. Trump vows to impose higher tariffs on imports if elected and to condition U.S. support for members of the NATO military alliance on them spending the agreed 2% of GDP on defence. German officials have said they expect to meet the 2% target this year.

Trump's claim of sending Taliban's Abdul a photo of his house sparks meme frenzy after Harris debate; here's why,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/trumps-claim-of-sending-talibans-abdul-a-photo-of-his-house-sparks-meme-frenzy-after-harris-debate-heres-why-12820242.html,World," September 12, 2024 / 12:06   ","Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump's claim that he had sent a Taliban leader named 'Abdul' a photo of his own house in 2021 during the much-anticipated debate with Democratic Presidential candidate Kamala Harris on Tuesday has sparked a meme frenzy on the internet. Recalling his role as the President in negotiating with the Taliban before the 2021 withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, Trump stated during the widely televised debate that he had sent a photo presumably as a threat to the Abdul- a Taliban leader- and asked him to instruct his snipers to stop killing the US troops in Afghanistan. ""He is still the head of the Taliban. & I told Abdul don't do it anymore, you do it anymore you're going to have problems. And he said why do you send me a picture ofmy house? I said you're going to have to figure that out, Abdul. & for 18 months we had nobody killed,"" Trump said at the debate. Notably, Hibatullah Akhundzada has been the head of the Taliban since 2016 and it’s unclear who Trump was referring to, however he was most likely referring to Abdul Ghani Baradar, one of the Taliban’s negotiators with the U.S. The withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan in 2021 has been widely viewed as a failure of the Biden administration, especially after 13 soldiers were killed in a suicide bombing. Following Trump's suggestion, social media users flooded the internet with memes. “Now that the dust has settled, can we go back to why Trump sent a guy named Abdul a picture of his house?”, a user wrote on X.  Now that the dust has settled, can we go back to why Trump sent a guy named Abdul a picture of his house?

Following the New York event, Biden and Harris also visited the Flight 93 memorial site in Pennsylvania and later paid respects at the Pentagon, where they laid a wreath in honour of those lost during the 2001 attacks. Biden issued a statement, recalling the unity the country showed in the aftermath of 9/11 and the resilience of the American people.

Dollar firm as inflation data douse bets for big Fed rate cut,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/currency/dollar-firm-as-inflation-data-douse-bets-for-big-fed-rate-cut-12819949.html,World," September 12, 2024 / 07:24   ","The dollar traded near a four-week high versus the euro on Thursday after signs of some stickiness in US inflation reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve would avoid a super-sized interest rate cut next week. Meanwhile, a quarter-point rate reduction from the European Central Bank (ECB) is widely expected later on Thursday, with investors anxious for hints on how soon the monetary authority will cut again. The dollar gained against the yen, following a turbulent session on Wednesday that saw the U.S. currency plunge as much as 1.24% to the lowest this year before recovering all its losses after the consumer price data. Early on Wednesday, Bank of Japan board member Junko Nakagawa reinforced the central bank's tightening bias by saying low real rates leave room for further rate hikes. Another BOJ board member, Naoki Tamura, takes to the podium on Thursday. The US consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.2% last month, matching the advance in July. But excluding the volatile food and energy components, the gauge climbed 0.3%, accelerating from the previous month's 0.2% increase. As a result, traders essentially priced out the chances of a 50-basis point (bp) rate cut on Sept. 18, paring the odds to 15% versus 85% probability for a 25-bp reduction. However, there are still 104 bps of cuts priced by year-end, meaning markets still expect a 50-bp cut at either the November or December meeting. The dollar rose 0.38% to 142.905 yen as of 0031 GMT, after dipping as low as 140.71 on Wednesday for the first time since Dec. 28 following Nakagawa's comments. However, the failure of the yen to sustain its gains ""has left signs of downside capitulation at the 140.71 low, â€¦ opening the way for a recovery back towards 145.50,"" said Tony Sycamore, an analyst at IG. The dollar-yen pair tends to track US long-term Treasury yields, which bounced back forcefully after dipping to a 15-month low of 3.605% on Wednesday, and were ticking up in Asian time on Thursday to last stand at 3.6609%. The euro eased to $1.1007, sticking close to Wednesday's low of $1.1002, the weakest since Aug. 16. The ECB lowered its deposit rate to 3.75% in June and an array of policymakers have already backed another cut, suggesting their debate is likely to focus on how quickly borrowing costs need to fall in subsequent meetings. Sterling edged lower to $1.30360, after dipping as far as $1.30025 in the previous session for the first time since Aug. 20. The Swiss franc was also on the back foot, with the dollar gaining 0.08% to 0.8529 franc, after touching the highest since Aug. 21 at 0.8544 franc on Wednesday.

"China detains investment bankers, takes passports amid increased crackdown on dealmakers",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/china-detains-investment-bankers-takes-passports-amid-increased-crackdown-on-dealmakers-12819941.html,World," September 12, 2024 / 07:11   ","China is turning up the heat on its army of 8,700 investment bankers. After being forced to take big pay cuts and adhere to other belt-tightening measures under President Xi Jinping’s years-long common prosperity campaign, the country’s dealmakers are now in the crosshairs of the nation’s top graft buster. At least three top investment bankers from different securities firms have been detained by Chinese authorities since August, sending a chill through the industry. One of them, who used to oversee dealmaking at Haitong Securities Co., fled the country and was arrested overseas about two weeks ago, before being repatriated back to China in an incident widely publicized on state media. Haitong and other state-backed brokerages recently asked many of their investment bankers to hand in their passports and seek permission for all business and personal travel plans, according to people familiar with the matter. The requests followed private guidance from Chinese regulators, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. Some employees were told that regulators are scrutinizing initial public offerings and other capital-raising activities, and that bankers could be called in for questioning at any time, the people said. The brokerages have tightened approvals for overseas trips and told staffers that they also need to get approval if they wish to resign, the people familiar added. Those approved for business travel have to do so with a co-worker, and activities outside of pre-approved itineraries would be restricted, according to one of the people.  In China, state-owned enterprises have been known to hold the passports of their senior executives and Communist Party officials. It is unusual for companies to extend that requirement to lower-ranking employees and junior staffers like in the case of Haitong and other brokerages. Haitong didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The detentions of investment bankers and regulatory probes are also raising questions about the future of China’s $1.7 trillion brokerage industry and domestic capital-markets activities, which have already slowed sharply while the broader economy sputters. China’s state-owned financial institutions have capped annual pay for senior staffers at 2.9 million yuan ($400,000), while recent pay cuts for onshore bankers at China International Capital Corp. have been as much as 25% of their base salaries. “All these crackdowns and restrictions will hurt the morale of financial workers,” Shen Meng, a director at Beijing-based boutique investment bank Chanson & Co. But if problems can be rooted out, then the industry could perform better in the future, he added. Shen said the goal of authorities is “to profoundly change the distribution of the profit pie in the entire financial industry.” Earlier this month, Shanghai-based Haitong agreed to combine with a larger state-backed rival, Junan Securities Co., in a share-swap deal that would create China’s largest brokerage by assets. The banks said their combination would produce a “first-class investment bank” and help promote “the high-quality development of the industry.” It also comes after President Xi said China should cultivate a few top-ranked investment banks, at a time when Wall Street firms are trying to expand in the country. The late August arrest of of Jiang Chengjun, who was a deputy general manager at Haitong overseeing investment banking, helped accelerate the deal’s timing, according to a person familiar with the matter. On Aug. 28, Haitong reported a 75% drop in first-half profit to 953 million yuan, in part because of declines in investment banking, trading and institutional client services revenue. Layoffs are likely to take place at Haitong, with a focus on its investment banking business, said the person familiar. The firm had 1,645 investment banking staff at the end of 2023, or about 12% of its total headcount. Financial Probes Chinese authorities have been trying to clean up the country’s $66 trillion financial sector since at least 2021, when President Xi set his sights on corruption in the industry. Wide-ranging probes have led to the detentions and arrests of numerous financial professionals at Chinese banks, brokerages, asset managers and insurance companies. The most severe punishments for financial crimes have included death sentences or life imprisonment for former top executives of some institutions.  Investment bankers were already rattled by last year’s disappearance of Bao Fan, a star banker who helped broker the mergers of some of China’s Internet titans. Bao has been assisting authorities in an investigation, and his detention has dented the business prospects of China Renaissance Holdings Ltd., the boutique investment bank he founded in 2005. It has lost about a third of its staff since end 2022, and its Hong Kong-listed shares crashed earlier this week after they resumed trading. Besides Haitong’s former employee Jiang, Chinese authorities also recently detained Wang Zhaoping, former vice general manager of Shenwan Hongyuan Group’s underwriting and sponsor division, the firm said in a Sept. 5 statement. Wang Chen, head of investment banking division at Guoyuan Securities Co., is assisting in an unspecified investigation, local media reported in mid-August. China had more than 8,700 investment bankers as of early September across 147 brokerages. Many of them are involved in capital-markets activities including IPOs and follow-on share sales. The combined revenue of securities firms in the country amounted to 203.3 billion yuan in the first half, official data showed, down 9% from a year earlier. Viewed as “gatekeepers” of the capital market, the role of investment bankers has become more important after China shifted away from a regulatory approval-based listing mechanism last year to a registration-based IPO system. Companies going public have to appoint qualified banks, or underwriters, as sponsors of their listings. New listings have slumped on the back of a sluggish economy this year, and hundreds of companies have scrapped their IPO plans. Chinese companies raised a total of 76.4 billion yuan in onshore listings so far this year, down 88% from a peak in 2022. China has been taking more bankers to task of late. Its securities regulator and stock exchanges disciplined 91 sponsor representatives through early September, according to official data. That compared with 88 for the whole of 2023 and 86 for the prior year. Sun Jianbo, president and founder of Beijing-based asset manager China Vision Capital, said the industry consolidation and regulatory crackdown suggest China’s going in the right direction to reshape its investment banks which had largely offered “inadequate” services. Also last week, Guosen Securities Co. announced it plans to buy almost all of Vanho Securities Co.. Some other Chinese brokerages earlier this year mapped out plans to acquire stakes in peers. “We don’t need that many investment banks and cutting redundant bankers is the first and necessary step for China to cultivate top-class investment banks,” said Sun. “We’ll inevitably see faster consolidation and potentially more personnel investigations in the future.”

Asian stocks rise as traders look to Fed rate cut,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/asian-stocks-rise-as-traders-look-to-fed-rate-cut-12819937.html,World," September 12, 2024 / 06:36   ","Stocks in Asia rose Thursday after a tech-fueled rally lifted Wall Street as traders looked beyond elevated core US inflation to imminent rate cuts next week. Equities in Japan and South Korea advanced, with the Topix up the most in almost a month. Gauges in Tokyo partly reflected the yen’s reversal from its strongest level against the dollar since December. US futures were little changed after the S&P 500 closed 1.1% higher Wednesday, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 rose 2.2%. Nvidia Corp. gained 8.2% as chipmakers rallied. Treasuries were steady, with the 10-year yield at 3.66% Wednesday. Swaps pricing reflected expectations for a 25 basis-point Federal Reserve rate cut when the central bank meets next week. Once the Fed begins lowering borrowing costs, the debate will center around the pace of subsequent easing. Australian and New Zealand yields were slightly higher in early Thursday trading. The so-called core consumer price index — which excludes food and energy costs — increased 0.3% from July, the most in four months, and 3.2% from a year ago, Bureau of Labor Statistics figures showed Wednesday. The three-month annualized rate advanced 2.1%, picking up from 1.6% in July, according to Bloomberg calculations. “This isn’t the CPI report the market wanted to see,” said Seema Shah at Principal Asset Management. “The number is certainly not an obstacle to policy action next week, but the hawks on the committee will likely seize on today’s CPI report as evidence that the last mile of inflation needs to be handled with care and caution.” An index of the dollar was steady after falling Wednesday. Oil held gains from Wednesday as Hurricane Francine ripped through key oil-producing zones in the US Gulf of Mexico, prompting traders to cover bearish bets. Bank of Japan policy board member Naoki Tamura is due to speak Thursday. On Wednesday, another board member Junko Nakagawa said the central bank will continue to adjust policy provided the economy performs in line with projections in comments that sent the yen higher. Japan’s producer price index rose less than expected in August. Other data set for release in Asia includes producer prices for Hong Kong, inflation and industrial production in India and a rate decision in Pakistan. Investors are also showing new interest in Southeast Asian equities, which have emerged as a favored trade among fund managers for the Fed’s policy pivot. US Rates Whether the economy is entering a soft landing that only requires a series of modest rate cuts, or heading for a harder landing at some stage in the next year is the biggest conundrum for investors. Currently, Fed swaps are pricing in over 140 basis points of rate cuts by the Jan. 29 rate decision, equivalent to roughly two half-point moves over the next four gatherings barring no intra-meeting event. “The firmer-than-expected core inflation print will make it harder for Jerome Powell to deliver a 50 basis-point cut in September,” said Krishna Guha at Evercore. “We continue to think a starter 50 basis-point cut is the right play and might even now win out. But the odds have moved against this, and risks to markets and the soft landing are higher as a result.” Guha noted that if the Fed doesn’t cut rates by 50 basis points next week, it will possibly do that in November. In corporate news, OpenAI is in talks to raise $6.5 billion from investors at a valuation of $150 billion, according to people familiar with the situation. Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said the limited supply of their products has frustrated some customers and raised tensions.

Trump, in an interaction with Fox News, suggested that Swift would “pay a price” for her political stance. “I was not a Taylor Swift fan… she’s a very liberal person. She seems to always endorse a Democrat, and she’ll probably pay a price for it in the marketplace,” Trump said while speaking to the broadcaster. Swift, one of the music industry's biggest stars, endorsed Harris for President shortly after the presidential debate between Trump and Harris ended. “I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos,” Swift wrote on Instagram. She included a picture of herself holding her cat Benjamin Button, and she signed the message with “Childless Cat Lady.” The remark is a reference to three-year-old comments made by JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate, about women without children not having an equal stake in the country's future. ""I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos,"" the pop star said. ""I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make,"" she added. Swift has a dedicated following among young women, a key demographic in the November election, and her latest tour has generated more than $1 billion in ticket sales. In a half hour, the post received more than 2.3 million likes. (With inputs from AP) "

Malsha Shareef and Mariyam Shiuna in the Ministry of Youth Empowerment, Information and Arts were disciplined along with fellow minister Abdulla Mahzoom Majid in January for comments they made on social media platform X. They labelled Modi a ""clown"", ""terrorist"" and ""puppet of Israel"" in response to his promotion of tourism in the Indian islands of Lakshadweep, viewed as a signal to pro-China Muizzu who had pledged to end Maldives' ""India first"" policy. The comments had angered New Delhi and sparked a campaign by some Indian celebrities on social media to promote local tourism, which dented Indian arrivals in globally popular Maldives, whose 1,192 islands in the Indian Ocean are dotted with luxury resorts. Muizzu's office did not respond to calls seeking comment. A government official confirmed the resignations of Shareef and Shiuna but declined to give further details and did not wish to be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media. The president's spokesperson was cited by local media as saying on Tuesday that Muizzu would make an official visit to India ""very soon"". It would be the Maldivian president's first visit to New Delhi since he won election last year in a region where India and China compete for influence. Muizzu made a state visit to Beijing soon after winning the vote and in June he attended Modi's swearing-in ceremony in New Delhi after India's general election. Maldives-India relations were hurt after Muizzu won power in April and demanded New Delhi replace 80 defence personnel it had stationed on the Maldives with civilians as part of his ""India out"" campaign. India agreed and completed the replacements in May while the relationship has been on the mend following diplomatic talks and meetings since.

UK slaps fresh sanctions on Russian 'shadow fleet',https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/uk-slaps-fresh-sanctions-on-russian-shadow-fleet-12819578.html,World," September 11, 2024 / 16:11   ","The British government on Wednesday announced new sanctions on Russia's ""shadow fleet"" of tankers which Moscow uses to export oil, bypassing a Western embargo imposed after its invasion of Ukraine. Experts say the so-called ghost fleet of tankers with opaque ownership or without proper insurance has allowed the Kremlin to keep exporting despite the embargo on exports and oil price cap on its global sales. The announcement came as Foreign Minister David Lammy travelled to Kyiv in a rare joint trip with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and as Russia's alleged acquisition of Iranian missiles raised fears. It is the third time the UK has attempted to crack down on what the foreign ministry Â said were ""critical revenue sources funding Putin's war machine"", bringing the total number of ships sanctioned to 25. The 10 ships targeted in this round of sanctions were ""high-volume offenders"", it said. Under the sanctions they would be ""barred from entering UK ports and refused access to the UK Ship Register. ""Today's sanctions further undermine Russia's ability to trade in oil via its shadow fleet,"" Lammy said in a statement. ""Alongside our partners, we will continue to send a stark message to Russia that the international community stands with Ukraine and we will not tolerate this illicit fleet"", he added. The latest British move to strengthen support for Ukraine comes as Lammy and Blinken are due to discuss easing restrictions on Ukraine over the firing of Western weapons into Russia. On Tuesday, President Joe Biden said the United States was considering lifting the restrictions on long range, US made missiles.

In a rare joint trip, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken took the nine-hour train from Poland to Kyiv alongside Foreign Secretary David Lammy, whose two-month-old Labour government has vowed to keep up Britain's role as a key defender of Ukraine. The visit comes as President Volodymyr Zelensky ramps up his requests to the West to provide weapons with more firepower and fewer restrictions. US President Joe Biden, asked in Washington whether he would let Ukraine use longer-range weapons, said: ""We're working that out right now."" Biden, while strongly supportive of Ukraine, has previously made clear he wants to avoid devolving into direct conflict between the United States and Russia, the world's two leading nuclear powers. Blinken, speaking Tuesday in London alongside Lammy, said the United States was committed to providing Ukraine ""what they need when they need it to be most effective in dealing with the Russian aggression"". But Blinken, who is paying his fifth trip to Kyiv since the invasion, said it was also important to see if Ukrainian forces could maintain and operate particular weaponry. Pressed later in an interview with Sky News on whether the United States would green-light long-range weapons, Blinken said, ""We never rule out, but when we rule in, we want to make sure it's done in such a way that it can advance what the Ukrainians are trying to achieve.""

The video was filmed by the military last Friday, its spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said, as a forensic team investigated the hostage deaths. It was released to the public on Tuesday after it had been viewed by their families and the Israeli security cabinet. The six hostages were killed on the night of August 29, Hagari said. Their bodies were found and retrieved by Israeli soldiers in the southern Gaza area of Rafah around two days later. Hagari said at least two Hamas gunmen shot them dead in the tunnel, which is 20 metres (66 ft) below ground, less than 170 centimetres (5.6 ft) high and about 80 centimetres (32 inches) wide. It has an exit shaft used by the militants, below a children's room in a house. The hostages had likely been held in the dank tunnel, where it is hard to breathe and to stand up straight, for some time, possibly weeks, Hagari said. A version of the video with English narration shows Kalashnikov rifle magazines, bags containing plastic bottles filled with urine and a bucket in a hole that served as a toilet. Women's clothing is strewn on the ground. The Hebrew version, broadcast live on Israeli television channels, also shows a chess set. Reuters was not able to independently verify the location or the date when the video was filmed. Israeli troops were in the area, fighting Hamas militants above ground, when the hostages were killed, Hagari said, adding that the soldiers had not been attempting a rescue operation. The military did not have precise verified intelligence about the hostages' presence in the area, he said. The six dead hostages were two women and four men aged between 23 and 40, five of whom were taken from the Nova dance festival attacked by militants on Oct. 7 last year. One of them was a father whose baby was born after he was taken hostage. The killings have sparked outrage and an outpouring of grief in Israel. Efforts to secure a ceasefire in Gaza that would include a hostage release deal have faltered, with Israel and Hamas trading blame for the deadlock. Mass protests last week demanded Israeli leaders do more for their release. Hamas-led fighters took around 250 foreign and Israeli hostages when they burst into Israel on October 7 and killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's offensive in Gaza has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians since. Around 100 hostages remain in Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed dead. More than 100 hostages were released in return for Palestinian prisoners in November and eight have been rescued by Israeli forces.

Wade, calling out his ""Trump abortion bans"" that often exclude exceptions for rape and incest. She accused the Republican candidate of planning to impose a national abortion ban if re-elected, a charge Trump has denied, insisting such decisions should be left to the states. Moneycontrol details an explainer of why the right to abortion is a pivotal issue in the elections this year and where it emerged from: On January 22, 1973, the US Supreme Court delivered a landmark judgement in Roe v. Wade, ruling that the constitutional right to privacy extended to a woman's choice to have an abortion. The case was brought by Norma McCorvey, known by the pseudonym ""Jane Roe,"" who had sued Dallas attorney Henry Wade over Texas laws that criminalised most abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life was in danger. Joining McCorvey in the lawsuit were Texas doctor James Hallford, who argued that the state’s vague abortion laws created uncertainty for physicians, and a childless couple, the Does, who wanted legal clarity on abortion access in the event of future medical risks. Together, their complaints reached the Supreme Court, which delivered its historic ruling in 1973 after hearing the case twice. Justice Harry Blackmun, writing for the majority, acknowledged the deep convictions surrounding abortion but asserted that a woman's right to privacy encompassed her pregnancy decision. He, nonetheless, also noted that this right was not absolute and that states could regulate abortions, particularly in the later stages of pregnancy. The decision effectively legalised abortion nationwide, leading to additional rulings such as Doe v. Bolton on the same day, which allowed states to impose restrictions on late-term abortions. However, nearly five decades later, on June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade with its ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organisation. In a 6-3 decision led by Justice Samuel Alito, the court upheld a Mississippi law banning abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy and returned the authority to regulate abortion to individual states. Alito argued that the Constitution does not grant a right to abortion, effectively reversing 50 years of federal protection for abortion rights. The Dobbs ruling had an immediate impact, with abortion bans swiftly taking effect in at least eight states. Soon after, protests erupted across the US, with abortion rights supporters voicing their anger and anti-abortion activists celebrating the ruling. Demonstrations filled the streets of major cities like Los Angeles and Chicago, and even smaller towns saw protests. President Joe Biden had called the decision “the realisation of extreme ideology”. The ruling drastically altered the US legal and political landscape, creating widespread restrictions in many states and sparking debates over reproductive rights, especially as the 2024 election approaches. Harris has emerged as a prominent advocate for protecting abortion access, sharply contrasting her views with those of Trump, who appointed three of the justices responsible for overturning Roe. Trump has since clarified his position, supporting exceptions for rape, incest, and threats to a mother’s life, while Harris, during their first Presidential debate, slammed his stance, calling it ""insulting"" to women and emphasising the challenges women face under stricter abortion laws.

"US Presidential Debate: To pumped-up Democrats, Harris was everything Biden was not in confronting Trump in debate",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/us-presidential-debate-to-pumped-up-democrats-harris-was-everything-biden-was-not-in-confronting-trump-in-debate-12819407.html,World," September 11, 2024 / 13:53   ","To many Democrats, Kamala Harris was everything Joe Biden was not in confronting Donald Trump on the debate stage: forceful, fleet of foot, relentless in going after her opponent. In a pivot from Biden's debate meltdown in June, Democrats who gathered in bars, watch parties and other venues Tuesday night found lots to cheer in her drive to rattle the Republican. In a race for the White House that surveys say is exceptionally close, with both sides looking for an edge, it was the Democrats who came away more exuberant after the nationally televised debate. “She prosecuted Donald Trump tonight,” said Alina Taylor, 51, a high school special education teacher who joined hundreds of people on a football field of the historically Black Salem Baptist Church of Abington in a suburb of Philadelphia, where people watched on a 33-foot (10 meter) screen. As for Trump, she said, “I was appalled"" by his performance. “People were laughing at him because he wasn’t making very much sense.” In Seattle, people gathered at Massive, a queer nightclub where scores watched the debate on a projector set up in front of the club’s large disco ball. The crowd laughed and cheered when Trump branded Harris a Marxist. More cheers when the debate moderator called out Trump's false claim that some states legalize the killing of babies after birth. “He's getting smoked,” one said. But in Brentwood, Tennessee, Sarah Frances Morris heard nothing at her watch party to shake her support of Trump. “I think he beat her on the border,"" she said. “I think he also beat her on actually having plans and letting the American people know what those are. And I think that Kamala Harris likes to mention that she has plans for things, but she doesn’t actually ever elaborate on what those plans are.” Morris conceded she was watching history being made, “because we have our first Black woman running for president.” But, she added, “I don’t think she delivered to get her to that place she needed to be.” Harris supporter Dushant Puri, 19, a UC Berkeley student, said the vice president took command before the first words were spoken — when she crossed the stage to shake Trump's hand. “I thought that was pretty significant,” Puri said. ""It was their first interaction, and I thought Harris was asserting herself.” At the same watch party, fellow student Angel Aldaco, 21, said that unlike Biden, Harris “came in with a plan and was more concise.” Aldaco was struck by one of the night's oddest moments, when Trump “went on that rampage about eating pets.” That's when Trump endorsed a baseless conspiracy theory that immigrants were stealing and eating people’s dogs ands cats. Harris was incredulous. “That was good,” the student said. It's questionable how much viewers learned about what Harris would do as president or whether she won over independents or wavering Republicans. But for some Democrats, despondent if not panicked after Biden's fumbling debate performance, it was enough to see a Democratic candidate getting seriously under Trump's skin. “He is pretty incapable when he is riled up,” said Ikenna Amilo, an accountant at a Democratic watch party in a small concert venue in downtown Portland, Maine. “When you poke him, he is really reactive and he doesn’t show the temperament you want in a president, so I think Kamala has shown she’s doing a good job."" Annetta Clark, 50, a Harris supporter from Vallejo, California, watched at a party hosted by the Oakland Bay Area chapter of the National Coalition of 100 Black Women. To her, the second presidential debate was a mighty relief from the one in June. “I couldn’t stomach the first one, if I’m being honest,” Clark said. “I tried to watch it and it was a little too much. This one I was able to enjoy.” On Trump’s performance: “It was almost like talking to a child with him.” Harris? “Fabulous job.” Democrat Natasha Salas, 63, of Highland, Indiana, saw the debate from an Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority watch party at a bistro in Markham, Illinois, and welcomed Harris' call to cool the political temperature — even as the vice president denounced Trump at every turn. “We all want the same things, Democrats and Republicans,"" Salas said. ""We are more alike than different. I want to see the country move forward and less divisiveness.” Interest in the debate transcended national borders. From a shelter for migrants in Tijuana, Mexico, where dozens watched a translated version of the debates on a television, Rakan al Muhana, 40, an asylum-seeker from Gaza, became animated when the candidates discussed Israel and Palestine. “We are running from the war,"" he said. ""We are running from the Israeli bombs. He (Trump) doesn’t see us as human. My daughter, who is four months — for him, she’s a terrorist.” Al Muhana has been on a four-month journey from Gaza to this border city, with his wife and four children. They left when both his mother and father were killed in a bombing.

How to leverage M&As to expand available capital and opportunities,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/how-to-leverage-mas-to-expand-available-capital-and-opportunities-12820338.html,Companies," September 12, 2024 / 14:08   ","By Manmohan Tiwana  India could become the world’s third-largest economy in the next five years and a developed nation by 2047, according to the World Economic Forum. These bold milestones are representation of the country's thriving markets and their ability to redefine the global business landscape. However, at the same time, the country struggles with capital shortage, which is now largely magnified by significant foreign direct investment reduction. Moreover, India's domestic consumption growth rate, which is a large driver of the nation's GDP growth, has also reduced greatly. Nevertheless, the country remains well-placed to withstand economic uncertainty supported by its large and young working-age population, advanced technological capability, business-friendly government and favourable geopolitical positioning in the China+1 strategy. It is at this juncture that the stage is set for India to bring in the capital it requires to meet its economic aspirations. Mergers & acquisitions (M&As), with their capacity to attract domestic and foreign capital investors, create new markets, improve products and services and generate jobs, may be the fastest way for the country to do so. The Power of M&As Speedy and sustainable innovation is the growth differentiator in today's competitive business environment. Though organically, businesses can achieve this with greenfield expansion, M&A offer a quicker though inorganic route to growth. This is because M&As give businesses an immediate way to enhance their portfolio of products, attain entry into newer markets, and enhance economies of scale – factors that also makes a firm more alluring for investment. Moreover, research by EY reveals that even during times of economic uncertainty, “M&As remain one of the most potent means of improving total shareholder return (TSR) and enterprise value (EV)”. M&As Shaping the Indian Economy M&A activity in India is a lot more to do with just the growth of an individual company. It is also part of driving a fast-moving business environment with a far greater economic impact. Successful deals bring in much-needed capital, foster innovation, creating synergies that can lift whole industries in the country. For instance, Tata Steel acquired Bhushan Steel in 2018, thereby increasing production capacity and hence market share in the long run, ultimately consolidating the Indian steel industry for better global competitiveness. Moreover, India, due to initiatives such as 'Make in India', has improved by leaps and bounds as the most developing hub for manufacturing globally and a hot destination for investment. Despite a slowdown post-2022, M&A activity in the country has remained strong in 2023, with high volumes recorded in renewable energy, infrastructure, logistics and healthcare, among other sectors, according to a recent Bain & Company report. M&As also have the power to attract global investors to be part of India’s growth story. Cross-border deals like the $16 billion acquisition of a 77 percent controlling stake in Flipkart by Walmart helped firm up India's ecosystem in e-commerce. These types of deals also allow firms to reach new technologies and markets. However, they also involve problems like regulatory hurdles and geopolitical tensions. Hence, while many benefits come with M&As, so do the challenges. However, the country's deals market shows promise on account of strong confidence seen across businesses and investors amid a global economic slowdown. Challenges and Considerations M&As in theory look like the best way to fast track business growth. However, in reality, they are based on careful planning, execution, and integration. Companies have to find their way through difficult regulatory environments, cultural differences, and market dynamics. After all, every M&A does not bring in the expected synergies, and some of them can cause loss of jobs, among other demerits. Hence, the full value from M&As should be realised by disciplined due diligence on cost and synergy with a detailed integration strategy, advises EY. Moreover, businesses can further improve their M&A approach by dealing with specific issues regarding the regulatory environment, cultural context, valuation difficulties, and legal risks. Businesses can also minimise these challenges by calling in for advice and guidance by M&A experts. M&As: Unlocking India’s growth potential The pace at which India is scaling the ladder to emerge as one of the biggest economies in the world, it is in dire need of M&As that bring in much-needed domestic and international capital. Such deals will help India fast-track its economic transformation, invite investment from all over the world, and fulfil its ambitious targets. This will also pave the way for India to serve its role to the maximum as the world’s most-promising economic powerhouse. (Manmohan Tiwana is Managing Director & CEO at Wodehouse Capital.)

Vedanta Resources prices $900 million bond issue at 10.875% with $1.45 bn order book,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/vedanta-resources-prices-900-million-bond-issue-at-10-875-with-1-45-bn-order-book-12819781.html,Companies," September 11, 2024 / 19:04   ","Vedanta Resources PLC, the holding company of Vedanta Limited, on September 11 priced its $900 million dollar bond issue at a final price guidance of 10.875%.Â The bond, due in 2029, has an order book of $1.45 billion from investors across the globe representing a 1.6x+ oversubscription, the mining conglomerate said in a statement. The net proceeds from the offering of the bonds will be used to repay (including by way of tender offers, redemptions, or otherwise) certain of Vedantaâ€™s existing bonds (including any accrued interest thereto) and to pay any related transaction costs in connection thereto, the company said. Earlier in the week, Moneycontrol exclusively reported that the company has begun discussions with lenders to raise up $1 billion through foreign currency bonds. Billionaire Anil Agarwal-led metals and mining conglomerate plans to refinance up to $600 million of bonds maturing in 2026 and also raise fresh funds towards equity infusion in some of the groupâ€™s existing and new businesses, sources told Moneycontrol. Vedanta Resources has raised over $2 billion in recent months through stake sales in India-listed Vedanta Limited. However, it has shelved plans to sell its steel business for which it was in talks with potential buyers. In July, Vedanta Limited raised Rs 8,500 crore through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) offering of which the company planned to use Rs 6,375 crore to repay in part or full the debt it owes to Oaktree Capital, Deutsche Bank and Union Bank of India (UBI). As of June 25, the company owed Rs 17,470 crore to Oaktree, Deutsche Bank and UBI. In its latest annual report, Vedanta said that its UK-based promoter Vedanta Resources, will look to reduce its debt by $3 billion over the next three years. The debt on Vedanta Resources' books stood at $6 billion as of financial year 2024 (FY24). TheÂ offering, which is itsÂ first U.S. dollar bond issued since Februarya 2021,Â is expected to close on September 17, 2024. ""We are delighted by the overwhelming response to our bond issue. This reflects the significant confidence of global investors in the Vedanta growth story and the quality of our assets, our commitment and track record to deleveraging our balance sheet, strengthening our cash position, striving towards greater operational excellence, and consolidating for growth,"" said Chief Financial Officer Ajay Goel.

Steel imports from China rose over 65 percent in the first half of 2024,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/steel-imports-from-china-rose-over-65-percent-in-the-first-half-of-2024-12819224.html,Companies," September 11, 2024 / 17:33   ","India's inbound shipments of steel from China surged by 66.7Â percent in the seven months of 2024, reaching 1.5 million tonnes (mt) compared to 0.9 mt during the same period last year, according to data from market analytics firm BigMint. This sharp rise underscores the growing influx ofÂ the alloy from the neighbouring country, despite efforts to boost domestic production. India turned into a net finished steel importer in the fiscal year ended March 2024 (FY24) as domestic steel prices wereÂ trading at a premiumÂ overÂ the landed import prices from China and Japan. The resulting slump in demand for local steel led domestic prices fallingÂ to an over three-year low. While the country's large steel companies including Tata Steel and JSW Steel have voiced concerns regarding the increased imports, the government is yet to arrive at a solution toÂ the reliance on imports. Local steel manufacturers also suggested that the steel being imported may beÂ pricedÂ below cost. Naveen Jindal, chairman of Jindal Steel and Power Limited, raised concerns about the ongoing import situation, labelling it as predatory pricing. He urged swift action to safeguard the domestic industry, stating, ""We have written to the finance minister and steel minister regarding this... The market is highly competitive, with prices lower than anywhere else in the world, yet imports are coming in at predatory rates."" It's not just the players,Â  medium and small businesses too areÂ naturally bearing the brunt. About 35 percent of stainless steel companies falling in the micro, small and medium enterprise or MSME category had to shut shopÂ between JulyÂ and September last year.Â Indian steel producers faceÂ levies such as electricity duty, iron ore duty, and coal cess, whereas imported steel is often cheaper due to the absence of similar taxes in other countries, giving foreign steel a price advantage. To ensure a level playing field, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal has proposed the idea of implementing a border adjustment tax (BAT), while encouraging discussions with the steel industry to protect the interests of domestic manufacturers. Last week,Â  steel minister HD Kumaraswamy promised to request the finance ministry to raise the import duty onÂ steel from the present 7.5 percent to 10-12 percent. According to BigMint data,Â  the top steel products that were imported include hot-rolled coil plates, pipes and tubes, electrical steel, and galvanised steel. What caused Chinese overcapacity?Â  China's steel production has surged in recent decades, establishing it as the world's top producer and exporter. However, the prolonged slump in the property market and a slowdown in infrastructure spending by some local governments to manage debt risks are now presenting significant challenges for the industry there. Since 2021, prices have dropped sharply in China, prompting some steelmakers to advocate for production cuts due to increasing losses and cash flow risks stemming from overcapacity.Â  However, overcapacity is likely to persist as nearly 55 percent of Chinaâ€™s steel products are used inÂ  property and infrastructure, and both sectors are unlikely to see a significant rise in demand in the coming months, according to Fitch Ratings. BetweenÂ JanuaryÂ and July 2024, China has overtaken South Korea as the leading steel exporter to India,Â accounting for 43Â percent of India's total steel imports, while South Korean shipments made up 31Â percent, according to data from S&P Global.Â  The surge in cheaper Chinese steel hasÂ meant thatÂ Indian steelmakers face challenges both inÂ the domestic market and the export sector.

"Renewable energy firm Juniper rules out immediate IPO plans, says company 'sufficiently funded'",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/renewable-energy-firm-juniper-rules-out-immediate-ipo-plans-says-company-sufficiently-funded-12819492.html,Companies," September 11, 2024 / 16:51   ","Delhi-based clean energy firm JuniperÂ Green Energy has no immediate plans toÂ tap the equityÂ marketÂ with an initial public offer (IPO) and has instead opted to raise additional funds from existing investors, Chief Executive Officer Naresh Mansukhani told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interview. He added that the company is well-funded by its existing investors, with total funding expected to approach $450 million soon.Â The independent renewableÂ power producerÂ operatesÂ solar, wind and hybrid power projects. The company has 2.5Â GigawattsÂ (GW)Â of projects pipeline under construction which is expected to be competed by 2026. ""Our investors started this platform with a commitment of $200 million as equity and then as we grew, the commitment increased to $350 million. They have increased it by another $100 million. So, we are sufficiently funded for next two years,"" said Mansukhani. The company is backed by Singapore-based investment firm AT Capital and Geneva-based energy and commodities trader Vitol. He expects the investors to raise funding in future based on Juniper's growth trajectory. In May this year, Moneycontrol had reported citing sources that JuniperÂ has initiated talks with investment banks to evaluate an initial public offering (IPO), which could see the company raise as much as $200-250 million or more. Mansukhani said, ""There are no immediate plans to go public"" and reinforced that the company is sufficiently funded with the new set of investments from existing investors. Power Plans In May, the company signed power purchase agreement (PPA) with state-ownedÂ Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam (SJVN, securing a 320 mega watts (MW) firm and dispatchable renewable energy (FDRE) contract. About 76 percent of company's portfolio isÂ in hybrid and FDRE projects. The company has a portfolio of 1 gigawatts of operating renewable energy capacity, and development pipeline of more than 5 GW of solar, wind and hybrid projects, according to its website. Asked about the rising delays in securing power purchase agreements (PPAs) for renewable power, Mansukhani noted, ""There's a good backlog now, we have seen projects built more than an year ago don't have PPAs signed yet."" Approximately 2.5 GW of projects, which the company completed three to five monthsÂ ago, are yet to sign PPAs with power distribution companies (discoms). MansukhaniÂ saidÂ that the company has adhered to strict criteria in selecting projects that offer clear commercial benefits and has avoided participating in bids that do not meet their standards. According to a Mint report, about 30 GW Of renewable power has failed to attract buyers amid lack of uniform tariffs and better grid connectivity. And, Mansukhani saidÂ that buyers still prefer renewable power to be below Rs 3 and that there isÂ psychological barrier that dictates anything above this is expensive. The challenges for securing PPAs come even as the Centre aimsÂ to tender 50 GW of green power projects every year till FY28 to support India's ambitions to achieve 500 GW renewable energy by 2030.

"New Industrial Cities: Ambitious idea, but finance and planning challenges pose concerns",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/new-industrial-cities-ambitious-idea-but-finance-and-planning-challenges-pose-concerns-12820008.html,Economy," September 12, 2024 / 14:26   ","By Miheer Karandikar  The Union government recently announced plans for 12 new industrial cities with a massive allocation of more than Rs 26,000 crores. These announcements follow the 2024-25 Union Budget's promise of funding for ""industrial parks,"" not cities. Announcements like these are not entirely new. Similar projects have been proposed before: in 2014 (100 new SMART towns), in 2022 (26 greenfield development projects in various states), and just last year, in 2023 (8 new cities as recommended by the Finance Commission). The announcement leaves many questions unanswered, and issues related to policy objectives, finances, infrastructure, and governance can be significant concerns. A fundamental issue with the current proposal is that it aims to achieve too much without a clear, concise objective. This approach goes against the Tinbergen Rule, which says that one policy instrument should have one target for it to be effective. Economic upliftment, export growth, SME development, job creation, environmental sustainability, and regional transformation are all listed goals. Similar criticism has also been levied against other flagship industrial policies like production-linked incentive schemes (PLIs). Attempting to accomplish multiple policy goals simultaneously through the same policy instruments can result in insubstantial gains. On the other hand, a policy focusing on targeted outcomes is a better use of state capacity and funds. Financial Concerns Financial considerations are another primary concern. The money allocated to build cities is often insufficient. NVS Reddy, urban expert and MD of Hyderabad Metro Rail, said, “... any allocation—be it Rs 10,000 crore or Rs 50,000 crore—won’t be sufficient for building a new city.” There is yet to be a consensus on allocation. The 15th Finance Commission laid out Rs 8000 crore as a ‘seed fund’ for eight new cities in the country. For example, the Dholera Special Investment Region in Gujarat has reportedly seen investments in the range of over Rs 1,50,000 crore. An estimate said that the GIFT City initiated an initial investment of $1 billion, approximately Rs 8,000 crores. The announcement mentions the new cities will have planned industrialisation and infrastructure will be built ""ahead of demand"". Such development has yielded mixed results globally. India's experience with the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) has shown that progress can be slow and uneven. China's Special Economic Zones (SEZs) built on this model have been largely successful but come with many caveats. According to a World Bank report, many of these SEZs are successful because they used the comparative advantage of the cities they were close to and weren’t necessarily greenfield projects. Governance Issues Governance and planning challenges loom large. The announcement needs to be more transparent on which agency will be charged with developing and maintaining these proposed cities. The lack of clarity on nodal agencies and their responsibilities could lead to inter-agency conflicts, as seen in Gurgaon's development. Clashes between the Haryana Urban Development Authority and the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon have often hindered progress, leading to inadequate infrastructure and haphazard growth. Research worldwide shows that empowered urban local bodies perform better than any other body governing bodies. A World Bank report emphasised the importance of empowering urban local bodies for urban development. The success story of Gurgaon, where private developers and companies collaboratively built infrastructure, offers an alternative model worth considering. There are other more minor problems too. The announcement mentions that these will be “world-class greenfield” cities. Greenfield cities are created on previously undeveloped land, away from existing urban centres, e.g., Jamshedpur, built on a forest area. However, most of these cities are already reasonably close to or are existing cities. Patiala in Punjab, Agra and Prayagraj in UP, Jodhpur in Rajasthan, Palakkad in Kerala and Gaya in Bihar are established Tier-II cities. At the same time, Dighi is almost a suburb of Pune. These areas are closer to the definition of brownfield cities, built on previously used land near urban centers. However, it might be advantageous, as brownfield cities could be more practical in the Indian context. Walk-to-Work Model It also mentions that the new cities will be built on the “walk-to-work” model. In general, India doesn’t have a good track record of walkability in cities. While studies have shown the benefits of walkable urban spaces, implementing this in industrial settings is a novel idea. If the government means these cities to be purely industrial or include residential areas remains a question. The government can draw many lessons from its past attempts at building cities. The Gurgaon example highlights the necessity for coordination between government bodies. Chandigarh shows how planning consciously and keeping the future in mind is essential. The government can also look at public-private partnership models like Jamshedpur and Coimbatore and small township plans like Magarpatta City in Pune. Solving these main problems along with finances can go a long way. Figuring out the basics beforehand will be very essential to the success of these cities. To borrow an analogy from urban development, building critical infrastructure before cities are built is much easier and cheaper than doing so after. India desperately needs these cities, too, with a rapidly urbanising population and signs of cracks beginning to show in the existing metropolises.

Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | India is doing rather well in a deglobalising world,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-pro-panorama-india-is-doing-rather-well-in-a-deglobalising-world-12819522.html,Economy," September 11, 2024 / 14:48   ","Dear Reader,  The Panorama newsletter is sent to Moneycontrol Pro subscribers on market days. It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. Globalisation is in retreat. The US, an initial proponent of a rule-based global system, is building barriers to trade. A second Donald Trump presidency, if he wins the election, will likely intensify trade wars. The latest action plan presented by Mario Draghi for the European Union involves security and reduction in external dependencies for the region. “The world has moved on to a very different system. As former British prime minister Gordon Brown wrote in the IMF magazine Finance & Development, the rules-based system has been replaced by a power-based order,” writes Manas Chakravarty in this piece pointing out intensifying challenges to trade and global economy. Even so, the world is not moving in a unidirectional manner. The realignment in global supply chains and geopolitical partnerships is opening new opportunities. India has embarked on a mammoth task of capturing them, with a good start. The success of Apple’s iPhones manufacturing in India is a case in point. The US-based company reportedly plans to sell the latest version of the iPhone produced in India globally. Importantly, as Apple produces more iPhones, its suppliers are setting up base in India and strengthening domestic manufacturing ecosystem. Jabil, a component supplier, plans to set up a manufacturing plant in India, joining other Apple’s vendors. A vote of confidence from Apple can help change India's image as the world scrambles to reorder its supply chains. Opportunities are not seen in electronics manufacturing alone. Numerous companies in chemical industry have set up new production plants and are supplying products to global majors. Even though excess supplies and competition from China are posing pricing pressures currently, domestic manufacturers are deepening ties with global innovators. What’s more, the passage of the Biosecure Act in the US is expected to accelerate diversification of global supply chains in the pharma industry. This will benefit contract development and manufacturing organisations and contract research organisations in India. Companies are already seeing a rise in workloads and enquiries from potential customers. “The first-order impact will be on the biotech/pharma companies directly involved in innovator research. In India, companies involved in discovery or development of molecules are likely to benefit from the possible shift of US companies to new vendors,” writes Anubhav Sahu of the MC Pro Research Team. Read more to find out potential gainers from the Biosecure Act. These developments show that India is navigating the challenges to global trade relatively well. Despite increasing protectionist measures, offshoring continues to rise in the IT services industry, a large employment generator. Global enterprises are scaling up their presence in India. Exports from global capability centres accelerated after  the COVID pandemic and touched $50 billion in FY24, point out analysts at Jefferies India. While these trends should please policymakers keen on attracting global investments into the manufacturing sector, India can do more to gain from the current realignment in global supply chains. Simplification of regulations, reduction in trade barriers and helping companies find the right workforce and facilities will go a long way in strengthening exports and supporting the Make in India project.

Data-based credit need RBIâ€™s push to grow,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/data-based-credit-need-rbis-push-to-grow-12818698.html,Economy," September 10, 2024 / 16:22   ","ByÂ Saurabh TripathiÂ  There is a general concern across the board in the Indian lending industry about an uptick in bad debts in the unsecured loan books of bank and non-bank lenders. Numbers indeed reflect this situation.Â  Retail unsecured credit on Indian banks books surpassed 12 percent of total bank credit in FY24 versus 10 percent in FY21. The regulator has proactively raised an alarm and weighed in on the industry to contain growth and prioritize credit quality.Â  Much of the industry has acknowledged the issue, appreciated the regulator, and firms have been recalibrating business plans. Are we missing something? The response of the industry and the regulator and the nature of discourse around the problem is leaving a huge opportunity to move Indian banking to next level.Â  We need to leverage this adversity to demand next phase of innovation in Indiaâ€™s credit practices.Â  Letâ€™s start with appreciating the unique demands of credit for India development journey ahead. Unsecured credit is here to stay in India.Â  The huge credit hungry unorganized small business in India, which takes unsecured personal loans for business purposes, simply does not have enough clean assets to offer a security to lenders.Â  There is thus a natural limit to how much secured lending lender can do. If we want credit to reach where it is sorely needed, we need alternate mechanisms to control risks in unsecured credit.Â  The real strategic need for India is to make unsecured credit to small business safer with technology and data. Further, India needs lenders who can operate sustainably and profitably on bad debt losses of up to 5 percent on their book in order to support certain classes of small businesses who genuinely operate in a high risk environment.Â  This is the only way to finance and grow the weaker segments of economy. Bank credit acts as venture debt as well. Underusing data Currently, the regulator as well as the investors get very paranoid when they see such a book.Â  If no one lends to these segments, we will short change the small business, job creation, and fundamental deepening of economic growth. Is the â€˜data richâ€™ Indian lending industry really leveraging the power of data fully?Â  The long-term benefit of the much-celebrated UPI adoption is machine readable bank statements with business transactions of very small businesses.Â  Without collateral to offer as security, small businesses can offer data to lenders to assess credit worthiness, develop early warning systems, efficient collection mechanisms, and guide small business to better financial health. The Account Aggregators offer lenders access to all bank statements of borrowers in digital format on regular frequency further accentuating the power of this approach. RBI actions are appreciable in the short term.Â  Regulators the world over are on the edge and so expect next five years of tight regulatory conditions.Â  We have bitter wars raging around us that expose global commerce and finance to entirely new form of geopolitical risks.Â  Technology is evolving and being embraced by banks at a pace that exposes financial system to unprecedented cyber threats and resiliency hazards.Â  Every good regulator will be tightening the belt and taking no chances to systemic stability.Â  The last thing society wants in these circumstances is for a bank to fail adding a new disturbance into an already charged context. So, yes, caution from the regulator is expected and welcome.Â Â  But we need a simultaneous development push as well in parallel.Â  RBI could do more to also insist on nudging the lenders to demonstrate their earnest efforts towards upgrading their skills in data-based lending.Â  It could give more leeway to lenders with advanced skills to operate with higher losses so long as they can demonstrate that they can sustain and scale the economics with technological heft.Â Â  This is genuine R&D. We should have tax exemption on costs of such R&D undertaken by banks.Â  Industry gets tax credit for R&D but banks do not! Indian Banks Association should evaluate this. Lastly, when industry fails to do an innovation, in India we have gotten a state / regulator sponsored central body to demonstrate the feasibility to encourage emulation.Â Â  NPCIâ€™s BHIM app was to basically do a tech demo for banks to emulate the UPI app.Â  We need something similar for data-based credit for small business.Â  Could RBI Innovation Hub take this up as a special initiative to do a technology demonstration on data-based credit leveraging UPI, account aggregators and other celebrated data platforms India is so justifiably proud of?

Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | The real fortune is at the top of the pyramid,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-pro-panorama-the-real-fortune-is-at-the-top-of-the-pyramid-12818687.html,Economy," September 10, 2024 / 16:01   ","Dear Reader, Renowned academician CK Prahalad popularised the notion of a vast business opportunity present in the lower rungs of society through his book Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid. Over the years, business enterprises tapped this huge consumer market through competitively priced products, and many have achieved commercial success. But along with changing consumer preferences, companies in certain sectors are making a slow retreat from low-priced mass-market products. Consider automobiles. Except Maruti Suzuki, no manufacturer has a car priced less than Rs 5 lakh in their product portfolio. Large automobile groups Škoda Auto Volkswagen, Toyota, Honda, Mahindra and Mahindra no longer sell small cars in India. The portfolio of Tata Motors, which tried to tap demand at the bottom of the pyramid launching a Rs 1 lakh car, is now heavily tilted towards premium vehicles. The focus among all these automobile manufacturers is on higher priced cars, utility and electric vehicles. Even Maurti is seeing rising contribution of utility vehicles to its domestic sales. In two wheelers, the market share of entry level 75-110 cc bikes dropped from 49 percent in FY12 to 28 percent this fiscal, show data collated by Jefferies India. Demand is moving to higher powered bikes, electric vehicles and scooters. Hero MotoCorp, which once dominated the market, is losing share. In alcoholic beverages, another industry with high consumer touchpoints, companies are reducing their exposure to low margin mass market brands. Last week came reports that Pernod Ricard has put its large mass market brand for sale in India. This follows a period of premiumisation and brand rationalisation at peer United Spirits. Even home-grown companies Radico Khaitan and Allied Blenders & Distillers are increasingly launching higher priced products. In housing, developers are striking gold in premium and luxury dwellings. Affordable housing, which was a buzzword before the COVID pandemic, is no longer in fashion. The market capitalisation of DLF, Godrej Properties and Sobha, which primarily sell premium houses, has soared amid rising demand. In healthcare, many multinational corporations scaled back their operations in the Indian pharmaceutical market due to stiff competition and lower price realisations vis-à-vis their home markets, points out Glenmark Pharmaceuticals in its latest annual report. While the domestic market is seeing increasing adoption of pure generic products, the focus at leading pharma companies is on strengthening the better-yielding branded product portfolio. “Despite the increasing influence of Trade Generics and Jan Aushadhi, Branded Generics are expected to remain predominant,” adds Glenmark. The trends underline two important points. Tapping the shallow bottom-of-the-pyramid demand is no longer a priority for companies in all sectors. Profitability and return ratios are increasingly driving their business strategies, which is a good sign. This is also partly driven by the consumer upcycle. On the flip side, the excessive focus on premium products skews the market and leaves limited product choice for consumers in the entry level and economy segment. But this focus on the top creates room for a disruptor to enter the lower end of the market with a well-positioned product and business model, that can grow into a bigger threat for the incumbents.

Wikipedia and the protection offered by SC’s Shreya Singal judgement,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/wikipedia-and-the-protection-offered-by-scs-shreya-singal-judgement-12819767.html,Politics," September 11, 2024 / 17:28   ","By Faisal Farooqui  Recent developments surrounding the Delhi High Court’s remarks on Wikipedia have sparked significant concern. The suggestion that Wikipedia could face a ban in India due to a petition from ANI is troubling and threatens the very essence of the knowledge revolution that India is experiencing. Wikipedia stands as a monumental achievement in the realm of free and open information. It operates on the principles of transparency and collective wisdom, with volunteers worldwide contributing to its extensive database without financial gain. Unlike social media platforms, Wikipedia functions as a non-profit, driven by the commitment of its contributors to ensure accuracy and balance through a rigorous self-regulating process. India’s Jurisprudence Supports Balanced Approach To Digital Freedoms The Shreya Singhal verdict in the Supreme Court in 2015 highlighted the importance of protecting free speech while ensuring that restrictions are carefully justified. Similarly, the MouthShut.com vs. Union of India case emphasized the need for nuanced regulations that respect digital platforms' roles in protecting consumer rights and fostering free expression. These legal precedents underscore the importance of maintaining a balanced approach to digital freedoms. The recent remarks from the Delhi High Court suggesting a potential ban on Wikipedia overlooks these principles. Wikipedia’s role is distinct from social media platforms like TikTok or Instagram. It thrives on a model of volunteerism, where scholars and enthusiasts collaborate to maintain the accuracy of information. The platform operates without personal or commercial agendas, relying on collective effort to ensure truthfulness and balance. Judicial Remedy And Source Of Contestation Everyone has a right to seek judicial remedy when their rights are violated. But by not suing the actual sources of publications and instead going after an encyclopedia that only cites these articles and threatening a ban on Wikipedia over contested opinions—especially those cited and moderated by experienced editors—sets a concerning precedent. Such a move could hinder not only Wikipedia but also broader public discourse, potentially stifling democratic engagement and the free flow of information. India, having missed the industrial revolution due to its colonial past, cannot afford to miss the current knowledge revolution. The industrial revolution brought transformative advancements that India was deprived of due to colonial exploitation. Now, in the digital age, the knowledge revolution represents a crucial opportunity for India to advance, bridging gaps in education and access to information. Platforms like Wikipedia are pivotal in facilitating this progress by enabling the free exchange of ideas and knowledge. Rabindranath Tagore, in his revered work Gitanjali, eloquently envisioned a world: “Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high; where knowledge is free”. This vision aligns with Wikipedia’s mission to provide unrestricted access to information and empower individuals. Threatening such a vital resource risks undermining the very foundation of intellectual freedom and progress. (Faisal Farooqui is a tech-entrepreneur and digital rights proponent.)

'Will not accept terrorism in India': Rahul Gandhi backs PM Modi's 'no-talks' stance with Pakistan,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/will-not-accept-terrorism-in-india-rahul-gandhi-backs-pm-modis-no-talks-stance-with-pakistan-12819198.html,Politics," September 11, 2024 / 14:16   ","Congress MP and Leader of Opposition (LoP) in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi, on Tuesday, hinted that the Congress largely aligns with the Narendra Modi government's no-talks stance with Pakistan until terrorism is curbed. Currently, on his maiden overseas visit as the LoP,Â Gandhi launched a sharp attack on Pakistan for ""instigating terrorism in India"" during his interactions in the United States. Speaking at the National Press Club in Washington on Tuesday, Gandhi reaffirmed that Pakistan's support for terrorism continues to be a major roadblock in improving relations between the two nations,Â stressingÂ that India will not tolerate such acts. Backing PM Modi's approach to Pakistan, he said, ""Pakistan's instigation of terrorism in our country is holding the two countries back. We simply are not going to accept Pakistan carrying out terrorism in our country, which is not going to be accepted, and until they keep doing that, there are going to be problems"". When asked whether the Kashmir issue was preventing dialogue between India and Pakistan, Gandhi firmly responded, ""No"". The Amethi MP, however, expressed clear disagreement with PM Modi's handling of China, accusing the government of allowing Chinese troops to occupy Indian territory in Ladakh equivalent to the size of Delhi. Gandhi, on a three-day visit to the US, also stated that the Congress largely aligns with the Centre on major foreign policy issues, including relations with the US, concerns over extremist elements in Bangladesh, and policies toward Israel.

Speaking at the National Press Club in Washington DC, USA, on Tuesday, Gandhi alleged that Chinese troops have occupied 4,000 square kilometers of Indian territory in Ladakh, an area the size of Delhi. ""If you call having Chinese troops in 4,000 square kilometres of our territory handling something well, then maybe we have got Chinese troops occupying land the size of Delhi in Ladakh. I think that's a disaster,"" he remarked. Gandhi further claimed that the media has largely ignored the issue, stating, ""How would America react if a neighbour occupied 4000 square kilometres of your territory? Would any president be able to get away with saying that he's handled that well?"". He further added, ""So I don't think PM Modi handled China well at all. I think there's no reason Chinese troops should be sitting in our territory"". Gandhi, however, at the same time, highlighted the importance of India and the US working together to offer the world an alternative to Chinaâ€™s ""non-democratic production vision"". The Amethi MP stressed the bipartisan support that the India-US relationship enjoys in both nations and expressed confidence in its future. He noted that there would be ""continuity"" in the Congress government's approach to India-US ties, stating, â€œI donâ€™t see ourselves changing direction very much from what Prime Minister Narendra Modi is doing"". This isn't the first time the Congress leader has made such allegations. Last year, during a visit to Ladakh,Â the Congress leader accused PM Modi of misleading the Opposition about the situation at the India-China border, asserting that China had seized thousands of square kilometers of Indian land. He referred to PM Modi's comments from a June 2020 all-party meeting, where the Prime Minister stated that no Indian territory had been captured, following a deadly clash between Indian and Chinese forces in Ladakh's Galwan Valley.

Speaking at the Georgetown University in Washington, DC, on September 9, Gandhi said he doesn’t hate the Prime Minister but only disagrees with his point of view. ""You will be surprised, but I don't actually hate Mr Modi... he has got a point of view, fine, I don't agree with his point of view but I don't hate him,” the Congress leader said. “In many moments, I empathise with him. I don't think like he is my enemy. He has a different point of view and I have a different point of view. I have empathy and compassion for what he is doing,"" Gandhi added further.I don't hate Mr. Modi.He has a point of view; I don't agree with the point of view, but I don't hate him.He has a different perspective, and I have a different perspective.: Shri @RahulGandhi at the Georgetown UniversityWashington DC pic.twitter.com/y3p5OW4CTECongress (@INCIndia) September 10, 2024 Gandhi arrived in the United States on September 8 for a three-day visit aimed at fostering “meaningful discussions and insightful conversations” to strengthen ties between India and the US. The trip is part of ongoing efforts to enhance the bond between the two nations. During his visit, he launched a series of attacks on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Speaking at an Indian diaspora event in Herndon, Virginia on Monday, he claimed that the fear of PM Modi among the people has now dissipated in the aftermath of the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections. At the event, Gandhi alleged that the BJP and PM Modi had created a climate of fear through the use of government agencies to pressure small businesses. He said that this fear, however, ""vanished within seconds"" after the election results were declared. ""Something has changed after the elections. Some people say 'Darr nahi lagta ab, darr nikal gaya ab'...It is interesting to me that the BJP and PM Modi spread so much fear, and the pressure of agencies on small businesses, everything vanished within seconds. It took years for them to spread this fear and vanished within seconds,"" the LoP remarked. Gandhi also dismissed PM Modi's once-prominent strongman image, saying, ""...In Parliament, I see the Prime Minister right up front and I can tell you that the idea of Mr. Modi, 56-inch chest, direct connection with god, that’s all gone now, it’s is all history now"". He asserted that the image of dominance and strength previously associated with Modi no longer holds the same sway. The Congress leader also took aim at the BJP’s vision for India, accusing the party of failing to acknowledge the country's inherent diversity. During his interaction with students at Georgetown University, he said that the BJP fails to understand India's rich diversity. Gandhi accused the ruling party of disregarding the cultural and historical diversity that defines the nation. ""BJP doesn't understand that this country is of everyone...India is a union. In the Constitution, it is written clearly... India that is Bharat is a union state, histories, tradition music and dance...they (BJP) say it is not a union, it is different...,"" he noted. Gandhi also took a dig at the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), accusing the organisation of promoting divisive ideologies that undermine India's diversity. The Amethi MP alleged that the RSS views certain states, languages, religions, and communities as inferior. ""What the RSS says is that certain states are inferior to other states. Certain languages are inferior to other languages, certain religions are inferior to other religions, and certain communities are inferior to other communities....,"" Gandhi said. He further said that every state in India has its rich history and traditions, which the RSS ideology fails to respect. ""All the state has its history, tradition...RSS ideology is Tamil, Marathi, Bengali, Manipuri, these are inferior languages...that's what the fight is about...These people (RSS) don't understand India.."" he said. He concluded by stating that this ideological battle represents a lack of understanding of India's diverse identity on the part of the RSS. Furthermore, sharing about the period just before the Lok Sabha elections 2024, Gandhi said that the Congress' accounts were frozen three months before the elections. ""Three months before the elections, all our bank accounts were sealed. We were discussing what to do next. I simply said, 'Dekhi Jayegi' (Let's see what happens), and we went ahead into the elections..."", alleged the Congress MP.

"Goldman Sachs says 'sell' Vodafone Idea but was spotted 'buying' in its FPO, what gives?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/goldman-sachs-says-sell-vodafone-idea-but-was-spotted-buying-in-its-fpo-what-gives-12820235.html,Market," September 12, 2024 / 15:38   ","Recently, international brokerage Goldman Sachs made headlines by reiterating its sell call on debt-laden telecom operator Vodafone Idea. However, savvy internet sleuths dug up VI's recent FPO documents, showing Goldman Sachs participated as an anchor investor in the telco’s offer. So what gives? On September 6, Goldman Sachs reaffirmed its bearish rating on beleaguered telco Vodafone Idea. The brokerage believes that the country’s third-largest telecom operator will be unable to stop the relentless erosion of its market-share, despite its recent capital raise. “Our analysis suggests a direct correlation between capex and revenue market share, and given our expectation of peers spending at least 50 percent higher capex versus Vodafone Idea, we forecast another 300 bps share loss for the company over the next 3-4 years,” said Goldman Sachs in its report.  However, the brokerage did hike its price target marginally from Rs 2.2 to Rs 2.5 per share. Regardless, the downside implication of a whopping 83 percent spooked the markets and investors rushed to offload their holdings on the counter, causing the telecom operator’s share price to crash 14 percent on the bourses. Also Read | Vodafone Idea FPO: 10 things to know about India’s largest follow-on public offer As the stock price sank in a sea of red, the internet was quick to react. Investors looked at the anchor book for Vodafone Idea’s recent follow-on public offer, where a Goldman Sachs fund was spotted bidding for 81.83 lakh shares at Rs 11 each.  How do we then reconcile the difference? Is it disingenuous, should such transactions be flagged by the regulator? Well, no. That’s because what we see as Goldman Sachs need not always be Goldman Sachs’s proprietary book! Foreign investors who want to increase their exposure to the domestic markets, but don’t want to undergo the hassle of registering as an FPI with the markets regulator SEBI use ODIs or off-shore derivative instruments. These ODIs are issued by an FPI, who usually buys or holds the stock or equity that the ODI represents. Goldman Sachs is one such FPI that helps foreign investors put their money into Indian markets. Remember, these are derivative instruments, the foreign investor is not actually directly buying these shares, the FII is. But it is doing so at the behest of the investor. Therefore, Goldman Sachs, when participating in the FPO, was facilitating a trade from a client’s end, but not necessarily buying it for its own arm, said a spokesperson for the brokerage. He added that Goldman Sachs was functioning as a market maker in this transaction, “what the research arm does is completely different”. On a similar tangent, let's look at the case of Swiss banking giant UBS. The two UBS funds participated in the FPO, purchasing 4.45 crore shares at Rs 11 each on April 16. Fast-forward a few months, and UBS released a note on Indian telecom giants on August 28. As telecom majors undertake a tariff hiking cycle, UBS expects around 90-100 percent of the total tariff hikes to flow through to revenues over two quarters. The brokerage reiterated its buy call on Vodafone Idea, bumping its target price up from Rs 18 to Rs 19 per share. Two days later, on August 30, a UBS fund 'UBS Principal Capital Asia' sold 38.2 crore shares or a 0.54 percent equity stake in Vodafone Idea for an average price of Rs 15.67 each. When asked to clarify, UBS declined to comment. Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

Simply put, ""Over time, supernormal returns of 20-30 percent inevitably moderate downwards. The lesson is simple: if one had mega years early on, moderating subsequent expectations, at least for the next 2-3 years, will help avoid unrealistic net worth projections and subsequent disappointment,"" said the study. For example, an investment made during the start of the year 2009 would have incurred an upside of 73 percent in the firstÂ year. However, the 10-year annualised return of the investment value gets narrowed to 15 percent. Also Read |Â Correction in 'narrative' theme signals shifting preferences towards defensives, says KIE However, the reverse is also applicable.Â The frustration of barely-there returns in the initial years tends to be followed by productive years that normalise a lot of the disparity between lucky and unlucky investors. ""If one had invested in the year 2000, first year return would have met with a decline of 18 percent but an annualised return in the 10th year of the investment was recorded at 14 percent,"" noted Capitalmind. Therefore, investors should embrace a long-term horizon to smooth out volatility andcapture the marketâ€™s innate tendency to rise, while using SIPs or periodic investments to mitigate the risk of poor entry timing. Most importantly, market participants should invested through downturns and view market pullbacks as opportunities rather than threats.

Shankar Sharma's quirky theory: How liberalising India's 'marriage market' can unlock economic growth,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/shankar-sharmas-quirky-theory-how-liberalising-indias-marriage-market-can-unlock-economic-growth-12820317.html,Market," September 12, 2024 / 15:15   ","In a quirky analogy, market veteran Shankar Sharma shared his take on why India might not be achieving its full economic potential, tying this toÂ high exit barriers in theÂ ""marriage industry."" While India has liberalised in most areas,Â but it remains totally ""commie"" or communist in nature when it comes to exiting marriages,Â wroteÂ Sharma in a tongue and cheeky post on 'X'. In order to resolve this, SharmaÂ suggestedÂ introducing a ""marriage IBC"" (a playfulÂ  reference to Indiaâ€™s Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code),Â which would make marriages more competitive by easing the process of exit (divorce). According to the theory, Sharma said that since there are such high ""exit barriers"" in marriage, people (particularly men, who are said to look like ""aloos"" or potatoes) donâ€™t invest much effort in maintaining their appearance or attractiveness. Similarly,Â most women look like ""bhaloos"" (bears) for the same reason as they donâ€™t feel the need to stay at their best because the risk of being replaced is low. ALSO READ: Correction in 'narrative' theme signals shifting preferences towards defensives, says KIE By introducing a marriage IBC, the idea is thatÂ if people could easily leave marriages, they would be incentivised to constantly ""stay at the top of their game"" in terms of looks, behavior, and spending on lifestyle improvements like diet, clothing, and luxury items. ""IfÂ marriage is bankrupt then immediately one should go to marriage IBC and find more suitable partner providing exit to people who are trapped even if it is that deep discount. That's how society becomes competitive,"" Sharma remarked. He further made a comparison to""F2-gora lands"" (foreign, developed countries), emphasising that theseÂ nations are wealthier because their marriage markets are more fluid, with fewer barriers to entry and exit. ""So men women have to be at top of their game always, so spending on diet, clothes, cars, toys, makeup is constantly rising,""Â Sharma noted. The final point Sharma made that if India adopted to this more liberal approach to marriage, India could see significant rise in GDP per capita, fromÂ $2.5k to $50k, thanks to increased consumption and economic activity driven by the need to stay competitive in relationships. Following the 'X' post, a lively discussion erupted among users. Some praised the theory, calling it ""unique"" and ""out of the box,"" appreciating the creative analogy linking marriage dynamics to economic growth. However, the idea also sparked skepticism, with one user pointing out that while the theory might work in a money-driven society, it overlooks the deep-rooted importance India places on family values, tradition, caste, and religious considerations.

"Correction in 'narrative' theme signals shifting preferences towards defensives, says KIE",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/correction-in-narrative-theme-signals-shifting-preferences-towards-defensives-says-kie-12820395.html,Market," September 12, 2024 / 15:03   ","Kotak Institutional Equities believes the recent correction in 'narrative' driven themes- largely PSU sectors like railways, construction and defence-- hints towards a shift inÂ preference for defensives, which have supported headline indices. In the past week, the rally in PSU named cooled down significantly, with the BSE PSU index slipping nearly 4 percent. On the other side of the spectrum, defensive plays are seeing increased traction as the BSE FMCG and the BSE Healthcare indices gained around 2 percent in the past week. KIE attributes this defensive rally to a pullback from high-beta and 'narrative' stocks as investors adopt a risk-off approach in response to global uncertainties. As for the risk off mode, the brokerageÂ identifies the recent slew of data warning towards a slowdown in the US,Â ongoing stagnation in China's economic policies and theÂ continued lackluster performance of the Eurozone economy as the culprits. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action Even as this risk-off sentiment is prompting investors to look towards fundamentals, KIE also warned against the stiff valuations of the defensive stocks, which pose further challenges to portfolio construction.Â WhileÂ the possibility of a gradual recovery in volumes of consumer staples started gathering pace about 2-3 quarters back, it is yet to bloom into reality. Similarly, it also remains to be seen if the much-anticipated recovery in demand for IT services would be strong enough to justify the sharp re-rating in their multiples, the firm stated. Moving to the PSU space,Â KIEÂ believesÂ that most of the â€˜narrativeâ€™ stocks trade at inflated valuations, driven by unrealistic growth and profitability assumptions.Â Highlighting the risks involved with this segment of the market, KIE reiterated that many of these 'narrative' stocks remain disconnected from fundamentals and could be vulnerable to further correction.

According to the NSO data, Indiaâ€™s nominal GDP at constant prices is estimated at Rs 295.36 lakh crore in 2023-24. Bajaj Housing Financeâ€™s Rs 6,560-crore initial public offering, which closed on Wednesday, 11 September, broke the previous record held by Coal India, which got a subscription worth Rs 2.36 lakh crore in 2008. Earlier this year, Premier Energies IPO received bids of over Rs 1.48 lakh crore, while Tata Technologies IPO in November 2023 got bids worth Rs 1.56 lakh crore. Institutional investors led the charge in the IPO frenzy for Bajaj Housing Finance, with their bids exceeding 200 times the shares allocated to them. Meanwhile, the retail category was oversubscribed seven times. Considering the huge demand for the stock, the stock has seen a further rise in the grey market premium. Currently, the stock is being traded at a premium of Rs 78 in the unlisted market, a premium of over 111 percent compared to the issue price. Why the frenzy The strong investor interest for Bajaj Housing Finance IPO has been driven by several factors.

It has a good quality asset base, with low exposure to risky assets and stable profitability. The IPO pricing is set at a premium compared to most peers, reflecting its strong market position and financial stability. Bajaj Housing Finance IPO Allotment Status Check Amit Jain, Co-Founder, Ashika Global Family Office Services said that as a subsidiary of Bajaj Finance, it benefits from a robust brand reputation and strong backing. The company has a profitable track record, low delinquency rates, and a diverse loan portfolio, which enhances its appeal in the growing housing finance sector. However, Jain warned that potential investors should consider risks such as rising interest rates and competitive pricing. Bajaj Housing Finance provides mortgage loans for both retail and commercial customers, with cross-selling and up-selling opportunities. It holds a 34 percent market share in the prime home loan segment, which makes up over 57 percent of its product portfolio. The companyâ€™s assets under management (AUM) have been growing at a CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of 39 percent, reaching Rs 97,071 crore by the end of June 2024, the highest among its peers.

Salaried customers and large home loans make up a significant portion of its loan book. The company is closely connected with its parent firm and has raised significant capital in the past to support its faster growth. Recently, IPOs have seen strong interest. In August, mainboard IPOs were subscribed more than 75 times on average, while the year-to-date average for 2024 stands at 66 times. For SME IPOs, the average subscription in August hit 290 times, with the year-to-date average over 259 times, according to the data.

"China's steel industry in bad shape, their exports a problem to us: Tata Steel's TV Narendran",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/china-steel-exports-a-problem-tata-steel-tv-narendran-12820388.html,Market," September 12, 2024 / 14:31   ","India should not allow Chinese steel makers to 'export their problems' to us, and the government must 'take some actions', TV Narendran, MD and CEO of Tata Steel - one of the country's largest steel producers - has said, on the influx of cheap steelÂ into the country. ""It is a problem which we had faced in 2015, and the same thing in happening now. The problem is that they (Chinese manufacturers) are selling steel at a price where even they're losing money. This is having an impact on the rest of the industries across the world. Other countries are taking action, India should certainly look at taking some actions,"" Narendran said in a conversation with CNBC-TV18. The comments from Tata Steel echo the sentiment of India's steel industry. JSW Group managing director Sajjan Jindal too had said in July that rising Chinese imports were affecting margins of domestic steelmakers. ""Several countries have raised barriers against steel imports, and the Indian steel industry is engaged with the government to ensure a level playing field."" JSPL chairman Naveen Jindal recently said that a 10-12 percent duty on steel imports will not be enough to fight the â€˜predatoryâ€™ dumping by China, as quoted by CNBC-TV18. Read More: India extends anti-subsidy duty on imports of welded stainless steel pipes and tubes Even the Minister of Heavy Industries, HD Kumaraswamy, on September 4 had said that he will push for higher tariffs on Chinese steel import and try to convince the Finance Ministry to raise import duty to over 12 percent from the current 7.5 percent. China was responsible for approximately 54% of the world's crude steel production in 2023. Narendran said India has enough iron ore for it not be importing the finished product, even as he acknowledged a section of consuming industries who are seeking cheaper steel. Tata Steel's TV Narendran has called for the need to find a balance when it comes to steel prices, so that manufacturers make reasonable profits to re-invest back into building capacity. ""India is blessed with iron ore, why should it be importing steel,"" he asked, adding it infact India should be exporting steel to other countries instead of importing them. Narendran added steel companies in India need to make at least 15-20% EBITDA margin in order to generate enough cashflows to build new capacities, which is a costly proposition. For Tata Steel, the margin in Q2FY25 could be lower than what it reported in Q1FY25, weighed down by raw material cost and an influx of cheaper steel from counties like China and Vietnam. China's steel consumption has been reeling under a prolonged slowdown in the real estate business, and while it has resorted to exporting more of the commodity outside of China, the iron ore market has currently seeing a situation of excess supply, say expert. In India, the demand remains robust, tracking the GDP trend, but Indian steel makers are not able to export as international steel prices weak, having fallen sharply this year.

OMCs to decide on fuel price cut if crude stays low for long: Petroleum Secy,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/omc-fuel-price-cut-windfall-tax-petroleum-secy-12820307.html,Market," September 12, 2024 / 15:25   ","Petroleum Secretary Pankaj Jain has said on September 12 that India's oil marketing companies may consider lowering fuel prices, if in their assessment, the trend of international crude oil prices remains low for some more time. Windfall Tax Review? He also confirmed to CNBC-Awaaz in an interaction that the Oil Ministry has been in talks with the Finance Ministry regarding the windfall tax, and the Department of Revenue will take a final decision in this regard. Both ministries will continue to engage in this matter, he said. Shares of oil marketing companies IOC, HPCL and BPCL were trading with modest gains on September 12, during mid-dayÂ trade. Oil Price Cut Coming? Secretary Pankaj Jain acknowledged that oil prices have cooled off in the last 7-10 days, and it needs to be seen for how long global prices stay subdued, as it may not be prudent to decide based only on one week's price movement. ""We need time to see if this trend (in oil prices) can continue going forward, only then can we assess any impact. India's oil purchase in done keeping in mind a longer duration of oil price trend,"" he added. A decision on price cut of petrol and diesel by the state-run oil marketing companies (OMCs), however, would be taken after reviewing the Brent price for a few more weeks, according to energy analysts. Oil Price Trend BrentÂ crudeÂ futures for November were near $71.61 a barrel and U.S.Â crudeÂ futures for October were at $68.23 a barrel,Â in early trade on September 12.

Citigroup and JPMorgan have put out projections which suggest oil may test $60 level in 2025. India To Welcome Higher Oil Output Regarding OPEC's decision on oil supply, Pankaj Jain said India wants the production of crude oil to rise, as demand from many countries such as ours remainsÂ intact. Earlier in the week, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cut its forecast for globalÂ oilÂ demand growth in 2024, and also trimmed its expectation for next year. This is the second consecutive downward revision by OPEC. IndiaÂ is the world's third largest oilÂ importer and consumer, meetingÂ over 80% of itsÂ oil requirement internationally. Pankaj Jain added that India will consider buying moreÂ oilÂ from Russia, if it offer cheaper rates. In July, India was the top buyer of RussianÂ oil, surpassing China.

The brokerage supports the recommendation due to strong industry tailwinds, improving profitability, a robust order book, and expanding offerings. VTW investment thesis: Positioned for growth in water security market The brokerage said the firm is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing water security and conservation market as global regulatory bodies allocate more resources to water conservation and tighten regulations on industrial waste. This shift has led to increased municipal and industrial spending on water infrastructure, creating significant opportunities for experienced players like VTW, it said. In recent years, VTW has enhanced its business mix, leading to improved profitability and cash flow, with EBITDA margins exceeding 13 percent in FY24, up from 8 to 9Â percent previously. Focus on Profitable and Sustainable Growth VTW is strategically selective in project choices, focusing on reducing the construction component in EPC contracts, increasing O&M revenues to 20 percent, boosting industrial contract share, adopting advanced technologies, expanding in key international markets, and choosing projects with higher payment security. The divestment of lower-margin entities in Europe has contributed to a steady rise in EBITDA margins, which reached 13.2Â percent in FY24. The company aims for margins in the 13-15Â percent range and improved revenue predictability while lowering default risks, Axis report said. Strong Revenue Visibility As of June 2024, VTW's order book stands at approximately Rs 10,676 crore, with significant projects in the pipeline, including a Rs 2,700 crore contract for a desalination plant in Saudi Arabia. With a target order book of Rs 16,000 crore by FY25, VTW expects strong growth, particularly in the Middle East, which offers larger project sizes and better margins. The current order book ensures revenue visibility for the next 3-4 years, supporting a stable inflow in the medium term, the report added. VTW Expands Offerings for Future Growth VTW is diversifying beyond its core water solutions by leveraging its expertise to explore new growth areas. The company has partnered with Peak Sustainability Ventures to set up 100 Bio-CNG plants across India, GCC, Africa, and Europe, transitioning from biogas electricity generation to compressed natural gas (CNG) production. VTW is also pursuing collaborations in the semiconductor and green hydrogen sectors to address water requirements. Axis expects these initiatives, aimed at tapping into cleaner energy and emerging markets, are expected to gain traction in 3-4 years.

A GCC is a dedicated offshore unit a company sets up in a foreign country to in-source information technology (IT) and related business functions. The NCR Indias includes national capital Delhi and parts of the neighbouring states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. India had over 1,700 GCCs in FY24, with their export revenue rising more than 40 percent from the previous year to $65 billion, the report said. The numbers are significant for India’s tech hub as the overall hiring in the IT sector has stagnated in the recent past. From the previous fiscal, Bengaluru’s GCC units count increased by 6.7 percent in FY24. NCR increased its tally by 5.7 percent to 465 from 440. At the third spot, Mumbai’s saw the lowest increase of 2.8 percent to 365 GCC units. A GCC unit is a single centre within a city or region but a company can have multiple units across a country, all part of one GCC.  Another city that stood out was Chennai, which increased its tally by almost 25 percent to 305 from 245. Tamil Nadu is giving Karnataka a run for its money, having announced plans to incentivise the creation of high-paying jobs in new GCCs. While presenting the budget in February, Tamil Nadu finance minister Thangam Thennarasu announced that the state plans to attract GCCs by offering a payroll subsidy. The structure would be: 30 percent in the first year, 20 percent in the second year and 10 percent in the third year for jobs paying more than Rs 1 lakh a month. Also read: Karnataka, Tamil Nadu woo GCCs with incentives in state budgets Advantage Bengaluru Apart from the vast tech talent pool and the ecosystem that Bengaluru offers, several policy initiatives have also been introduced by the state. Karnataka is mulling a dedicated GCC policy to attract higher investment. When the plan fructifies, it will be the first state in India to enact such a policy. Karnataka introduced the ""Karnataka Startup Policy 2022-2027"" in 2022 to promote industry partnerships between technology institutions and the existing GCC ecosystem in the state. In terms of land absorption, Bengaluru topped GCC leasing with over 15.34 million sq ft (msf) of absorption among the top eight cities in 2023, according to Knight Frank India. GCCs will occupy around 35 percent of all commercial real estate in India in 2024 and IT companies around 16 percent, the same report said. In March, a report by Nasscom and Zinnov said Bengaluru was the frist choice of semiconductor companies setting up GCCs in India.

In a statement issue on September 11, the agency accused Viresh Joshi, a former chief trader and fund manager at Axis Mutual Fund, of sharing market-sensitive information in exchange for kickbacks from brokers as part of a front-running scam. ""Movable properties, including foreign currencies such as GBP, Euro, and AED amounting to Rs 12.96 lakh, as well as various incriminating documents linked to overseas immovable properties, overseas bank accounts, and digital devices, were seized,"" the ED said. The agency alleged that Joshi shared market-sensitive information with brokers operating out of Dubai, who executed trades based on his instructions. It also claimed that Joshi contacted individuals and entities in India, renting their trading accounts to carry out these transactions. The ""illicit gains"" from these trades were reportedly received by Joshi in cash from the brokers, the ED added. The funds were further utilised to create fixed deposits and purchase properties in India. The ED's probe follows a 2022 Income Tax Department raid on Joshi related to the same case. The investigation was triggered by an interim order from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which alleged that Joshi and others engaged in front-running, generating wrongful gains amounting to Rs 30.56 crore. The ED also claimed that Joshi routed the cash through Kolkata-based operators into the bank accounts of several shell entities. These entities allegedly provided unsecured loans to Joshi, his family members, and firms owned by them. The proceeds from the front-running scam were reportedly used to buy properties abroad, with documents seized showing the purchase of two properties in the UK. The agency said that Rs 14 crore had been remitted abroad for this purpose. (With inputs from PTI) "

As in the past, the rundown will not impair the companyâ€™s net worth thanks to pockets of value in Shriram Life/General investments, AIF recoveries and tax-related gains. Unsecured digital loans are still a difficult but unavoidable channel (necessary evil) for lenders primarily focused on customer acquisition. The behavior and credit requirements of customers acquired digitally are different from those of customers acquired through physical channels. Retail (at industry level) has been benign for the last two years, and growth/asset quality metrics could deteriorate by FY25 end. PIEL is making efforts to further strengthen its retail franchise; however, the reduction in opex ratios and improvements in the RoA profile will be only linear and gradual (no quick fixes). Outlook We do not see catalysts for any meaningful improvement in the core earnings trajectory of the company. We expect PIEL to deliver ~1.7% RoA and ~6% RoE in FY26.

This growth has improved the bank's CD ratio from 102% in FY22 to 86% currently, and increased the retail deposit mix to 69%. The ongoing stress in the MFI segment has impacted profitability, but MFI business exposure has reduced to ~17% from 19% in FY22. The bankâ€™s ability to recover from credit cycles suggests potential asset quality improvement from 2HFY25 onwards. EQUITASBâ€™s stock price, which peaked at INR115 in January 2024, has corrected by 29%. We believe sustained loan growth estimated at 23% CAGR and improvement in RoA to 1.7% by FY26E will enable improvement in stock performance, particularly as confidence in asset quality improves. We have adjusted our earnings estimates for EQUITASB by incorporating higher credit costs, which would result in an 11%/12% reduction for FY25/26E. Despite this, we project a strong earnings recovery in FY26, with RoA/RoE improving to 1.7%/14.7%. Outlook We, thus, find the stockâ€™s current valuation attractive at 1.3x FY26 BV, a 51% discount to AUBANK. We maintain our BUY rating with a revised TP of INR100 (based on 1.6x FY26E ABV).

The brokerage supports the recommendation due to strong industry tailwinds, improving profitability, a robust order book, and expanding offerings. VTW investment thesis: Positioned for growth in water security market The brokerage said the firm is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing water security and conservation market as global regulatory bodies allocate more resources to water conservation and tighten regulations on industrial waste. This shift has led to increased municipal and industrial spending on water infrastructure, creating significant opportunities for experienced players like VTW, it said. In recent years, VTW has enhanced its business mix, leading to improved profitability and cash flow, with EBITDA margins exceeding 13 percent in FY24, up from 8 to 9Â percent previously. Focus on Profitable and Sustainable Growth VTW is strategically selective in project choices, focusing on reducing the construction component in EPC contracts, increasing O&M revenues to 20 percent, boosting industrial contract share, adopting advanced technologies, expanding in key international markets, and choosing projects with higher payment security. The divestment of lower-margin entities in Europe has contributed to a steady rise in EBITDA margins, which reached 13.2Â percent in FY24. The company aims for margins in the 13-15Â percent range and improved revenue predictability while lowering default risks, Axis report said. Strong Revenue Visibility As of June 2024, VTW's order book stands at approximately Rs 10,676 crore, with significant projects in the pipeline, including a Rs 2,700 crore contract for a desalination plant in Saudi Arabia. With a target order book of Rs 16,000 crore by FY25, VTW expects strong growth, particularly in the Middle East, which offers larger project sizes and better margins. The current order book ensures revenue visibility for the next 3-4 years, supporting a stable inflow in the medium term, the report added. VTW Expands Offerings for Future Growth VTW is diversifying beyond its core water solutions by leveraging its expertise to explore new growth areas. The company has partnered with Peak Sustainability Ventures to set up 100 Bio-CNG plants across India, GCC, Africa, and Europe, transitioning from biogas electricity generation to compressed natural gas (CNG) production. VTW is also pursuing collaborations in the semiconductor and green hydrogen sectors to address water requirements. Axis expects these initiatives, aimed at tapping into cleaner energy and emerging markets, are expected to gain traction in 3-4 years.

"Agri Picks Report September 11, 2024: Geojit Financial Services",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/agri-picks-report-september-11-2024-geojit-financial-services-12819163.html,Commodities," September 11, 2024 / 10:25   ","Geojit Financial Services's report on Daily Agri Picks Production of crude palm oil in Malaysia rose 2.9% on month to 1.89 mln tn in August, according to preliminary data from the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. Production during Aug-Oct accounts for approximately 30% of Malaysia's annual crude palm oil output. Oil palm trees have a seasonal fruiting pattern, with peak production often occurring during the second half of the year. The fruit bunches, which are harvested to extract palm oil, are abundant in these months. Exports of palm oil in August declined 9.7% on month to 1.53 mln tn. However, biodiesel exports rose 189.6% on month to 29,963 tn, the data showed. Palm oil is also used to make biofuel. Total stocks of palm oil in the country rose 7.3% on month to 1.88 mln tn in August, reflecting increased production and sluggish exports. Malaysia is the world's second-largest producer of crude palm oil, and India is the largest consumer of edible oils. â€¢ Farmers across the country have sown kharif crops across 109.2 mln ha as of Monday, up 2.2% from a year ago, with notable increases in acreage of paddy and pulses, data from the agriculture ministry showed. Sowing has improved since July due to higher rainfall after a slow start in June. The area under paddy, one of the most important kharif crops, rose 4% on year to nearly 41 mln ha as of today. Progress in the sowing of paddy and current rice stocks with the Centre have led the government to allow grain-deficient states to buy rice from Food Corp of India through open market sales, without participating in electronic auctions. Given the surplus availability of rice with Food Corp of India, the Centre has allowed ethanol distilleries to participate in the corporation's weekly rice auctions. Distilleries can buy a maximum of 2.3 mln tn of rice from the auctions. As of Aug 1, rice stocks with the Centre were the highest since 2005 at 32.8 mln tn. Rice stocks have risen nearly 35% on year and are far above the Jul-Sep buffer norm of 13.5 mln tn--operational stock of 11.5 mln tn and strategic reserve of 2 mln tn. Apart from rice, FCI has 19.00 mln tn of unmilled paddy. After deficient production last year, the area under pulses was up nearly 8% on year at 12.6 mln ha as of Monday. Within pulses, acreage under tur was significantly up by over 12% on year at 4.6 mln ha, data from the ministry showed. Experts say good rainfall in the current monsoon season is expected to improve the cultivation of pulses. India is heavily reliant on other countries to meet the domestic demand for certain pulses such as tur and urad. A rise in sowing this year is expected to bring down imports of these pulses, industry officials say. India, the third-largest importer of tur dal in the world after the US and Canada, imports most of its tur from Mozambique, Malawi and Myanmar. The sharp increase in tur acreage was mainly due to the early onset of the southwest monsoon in top turproducing states such as Karnataka. During the previous kharif season, sowing of crops was delayed owing to the erratic monsoon. Tur acreage in Karnataka was up 23% on year at 1.6 mln ha as of Aug 30, the state's sowing data showed. Similarly, the area under maize in Karnataka was at 1.6 mln ha as of Aug 30, against 1.5 mln ha a year ago. Maize acreage across the country was up 5.4% at 8.7 mln ha as of Monday. The area under oilseeds was 19.2 mln ha as of Monday, up nearly 2% from a year ago. Soybean acreage rose 1% on year to 12.5 mln ha. The area under cotton was 11.2 mln ha, down 9% from a year ago. Groundnut acreage increased over 9% to 4.7 mln ha. In September, rainfall is likely to be above normal in most parts of India at over 109% of the long-period average, the India Meterological Department said. However, some parts of extreme north India, south peninsular India, and most parts of northeast are likely to receive below-normal rainfall, the department said in its monthly forecast for September. The forecast indicates a higher likelihood of La Nina conditions developing during the end of the monsoon season, it said, adding that there was a 66% chance of La Nina during Sep-Nov. The La Nina weather phenomenon will set in after a year of El Nino conditions over India. While the La Nina brings good rainfall in India, the El Nino is associated with hotter and drier climate over the country.
