How a research analyst's article led Sebi to Axis Capital's 'high-risk transaction',https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebis-action-on-axis-capital-research-analysts-article-tipped-off-the-regulator-about-high-risk-transaction-12825839.html,general," September 19, 2024 / 21:04   ","A registered research analyst's article had flagged the irregularity in Axis Capital's (ACL's) handling of a non-convertible debenture issue to the market regulator. It was an article by Hemindra Kishen Hazari, titled ""Is Axis Capital an Investment Bank or a Hedge Fund"" and dated January 16, 2024, that brought the regulator's attention to the NCD issue. On September 19, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) passed an interim order restraining ACL from taking any new assignments in the capacity of a merchant banker, arranger or underwriter for any issue or offer for sale of securities in the debt segment until further orders. Also read: Sebi bars Axis Capital from acting as investment banker in debt market until further orders The order passed by Sebi's Whole-time Member (WTM) Ashwani Bhatia stated that Hazari's article highlighted certain concerns regarding a high-risk transaction undertaken by ACL, a Sebi-registered merchant banker and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Axis Bank. Following the reading of this article, the regulator's officials conducted an inspection of ACL. The inspection examined whether the transaction undertaken by ACL in respect of listed Non-Convertible Debentures (“NCDs”) of Sojo Infotel Pvt. Ltd. The regulator passed an interim order stating that ACL provided guarantee for the NCD issue in the guise of underwriting, which is not permitted under the existing regulatory framework. The regulator even found such an arrangement posing a risk to the financial system as ""it can potentially disrupt the orderly functioning of the market"". Hazari, according to his webpage, is a commentator with over 25 years of experience in the Indian capital markets. He has specialised in research on banking and the macro-economy. The page added, ""He has managerial experience of establishing profitable equities business, leading and mentoring analysts."" What was the arrangement ACL came to?For the NCD issue, a debenture trustee deed (DTD) was executed between Sojo, Axis Debenture Trustee (ADT) and ACL. Sojo had pledged the shares of LIL as security cover for the NCD issue. Under the DTD, if there a default, the debenture trustee would invoke a pledge. Then, according to the DTD, if ACL is not able to find buyers for the pledged shares, it would have to fulfil its ""underwriting commitment"", by having to purchase or fund the purchase of these pledged shares. As the order noted, ""ACL was unconditionally, unequivocally and irrevocablyobligated to purchase or fund the purchase of the Pledged Shares."" The order stated, ""The commitment provided by ACL in respect of NCDs of Sojo cannot be termed as an underwriting activity as it was not an agreement to “subscribe to or procure subscription for securities, issued or offered for sale, remaining unsubscribed.” Rather, it was a guarantee to redeem the NCDs of Sojo in the event of default on maturity."" The order noted that, with this arrangement, ACL went beyond the mandate of issue management and its activity was in contravention of the definition of underwriting and the role of Merchant Banker as defined in MB Regulations, 1992.

However, it could not sustain all of those gains due to profit booking, ending with a 38-point gain at 25,416 on September 19. The index failed to sustain above the upward-sloping resistance trendline, which is crucial for a further upward move towards 25,600. Until then, it may consolidate with support at 25,300, according to experts. Below are 15 data points we have collated to help you spot profitable trades:  Here are 15 data points we have collated to help you spot profitable trades: 1) Key Levels For The Nifty 50 Resistance based on pivot points: 25,558, 25,614, and 25,704 Support based on pivot points: 25,378, 25,322, and 25,232 Special Formation: The Nifty 50 formed a bearish candlestick pattern with a long upper shadow on the daily charts, indicating profit booking at higher levels. However, it remained above all key moving averages, with a positive bias in momentum indicators such as the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence). 2) Key Levels For The Bank Nifty Resistance based on pivot points: 53,273, 53,392, and 53,585 Support based on pivot points: 52,887, 52,767, and 52,574 Resistance based on Fibonacci retracement: 53,362, 54,368 Support based on Fibonacci retracement: 52,491, 51,949 Special Formation: The Bank Nifty continued to outperform the benchmark Nifty 50, hitting a fresh record high by rising 287 points to close at 53,038. The index formed a bullish candlestick pattern with a long upper shadow on the daily charts, resembling a Shooting Star pattern at the high (which is a bearish reversal pattern), signalling some profit booking at the peak. The index continued its higher highs-higher lows formation for the sixth consecutive session.  3) Nifty Call Options Data According to the weekly options data, the 25,400 strike holds the maximum open interest (with 2.41 crore contracts). This level can act as a key level for the Nifty in the short term. It was followed by the 25,500 strike (1.38 crore contracts) and the 26,000 strike (1.1 crore contracts). Maximum Call writing was observed at the 25,400 strike, which saw an addition of 1.84 crore contracts, followed by the 25,500 and 25,800 strikes, which added 69.14 lakh and 39.97 lakh contracts, respectively. The maximum unwinding was seen at the 25,300 strike, which shed 10.42 lakh contracts, followed by the 26,500 and 25,200 strikes, which shed 9.97 lakh and 4.37 lakh contracts, respectively.  4) Nifty Put Options Data On the Put side, the maximum open interest was seen at the 25,400 strike (with 2.09 crore contracts), which can act as a key level for the Nifty. It was followed by the 25,000 strike (90.77 lakh contracts) and the 25,500 strike (71.81 lakh contracts). The maximum Put writing was observed at the 25,400 strike, which saw an addition of 1.79 crore contracts, followed by the 25,500 and 25,300 strikes, with 62.21 lakh and 26.93 lakh contracts added, respectively, while the Put unwinding was seen at the 24,500 strike, which shed 25.7 lakh contracts, followed by the 24,400 and 24,300 strikes, which shed 7.22 lakh and 7.04 lakh contracts, respectively.  5) Bank Nifty Call Options Data According to the monthly options data, the 53,000 strike holds maximum open interest, with 21.35 lakh contracts.

Maximum Call writing was visible at the 53,200 strike (with the addition of 8.27 lakh contracts), followed by the 53,500 strike (7.9 lakh contracts) and the 54,000 strike (7.86 lakh contracts), while the maximum unwinding was seen at the 52,700 strike, which shed 1.63 lakh contracts, followed by the 52,800 and 52,500 strikes, which shed 1.61 lakh and 1.33 lakh contracts, respectively.  6) Bank Nifty Put Options Data On the Put side, the maximum open interest was seen at the 52,000 strike (with 22.61 lakh contracts), which can act as a key support level for the index. This was followed by the 53,000 strike (20.05 lakh contracts) and the 52,500 strike (17.04 lakh contracts). The maximum Put writing was observed at the 53,000 strike (which added 12.98 lakh contracts), followed by the 52,500 strike (8.88 lakh contracts) and the 51,500 strike (5.66 lakh contracts), while there was hardly any Put unwinding seen.  7) Funds Flow (Rs crore)  8) Put-Call Ratio The Nifty Put-Call ratio (PCR), which indicates the mood of the market, jumped to 1.26 on September 19, from 1.13 levels in the previous session. The increasing PCR, or being higher than 0.7 or surpassing 1, means traders are selling more Put options than Call options, which generally indicates the firming up of a bullish sentiment in the market. If the ratio falls below 0.7 or moves towards 0.5, then it indicates selling in Calls is higher than selling in Puts, reflecting a bearish mood in the market.  9) India VIX Volatility dropped sharply after the end of uncertainty related to the Federal Reserve event, providing more comfort to the bulls. The India VIX, the fear index, fell by 6.75 percent to 12.47, down from 13.37 levels.  10) Long Build-up (54 Stocks) A long build-up was seen in 54 stocks.

RBI lifts restrictions imposed on IIFL Finance's gold loan business,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/rbi-lifts-restrictions-imposed-on-iifl-finances-gold-loan-business-12825738.html,general," September 19, 2024 / 18:31   ","IIFL Finance Ltd said on September 19 that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has lifted restrictions imposed on the company's gold loan business. ""RBI, through its communication dated September 19, 2024, has lifted the restrictions imposed on the gold loan business of the company. The RBI's decision is effective immediately and allows the Company to resume the sanctioning, disbursal, assignment, securitisation, and sale of gold loans in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations,"" said IIFL Finance in a stock exchange filing. On September 19, IIFL Finance's shares on NSE closed trading 6 percent lower at Rs 497 apiece. ""The Company is committed to upholding the highest standards of compliance and will continue to ensure that the remedial actions taken are sustained,"" added IIFL Finance. RBI had imposed the curbs on March 4, 2024. IIFL fell under regulatory scrutiny in March amid a crackdown on financial firms, when it was asked by RBI to stop disbursing new gold-backed lending following “material supervisory concerns”. Three local rating companies - ICRA Ltd, Crisil Ltd and Care Ratings Ltd - put it under rating watch with negative or developing implications following the ban. International credit assessor Fitch Ratings also put its B+ rating on negative watch. Its employee number in gold loan branches already dropped from 15,000 in March to 12,000 in June, according to its financial reports, reported Bloomberg earlier on September 19. The assets under management in its gold loan business more than halved to Rs 12,162 crore as of August 5 since the March ban. In March, RBI said an inspection of the company was carried out by it with reference to IIFL’s financial position as of March 31, 2023. “Certain material supervisory concerns were observed in the gold loan portfolio of the company, including serious deviations in assaying and certifying purity and net weight of the gold at the time of sanction of loans and at the time of auction upon default…,” it noted. In March, RBI had said the supervisory restrictions will be reviewed upon completion of a special audit to be instituted by the RBI and after rectification by the company of the special audit findings and the findings of RBI inspection are to the satisfaction of the central bank.

S&P 500 hits all-time high on Wall Street investors soft-landing hopes,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sp-500-hits-all-time-high-on-wall-street-investors-soft-landing-hopes-12825845.html,general," September 19, 2024 / 21:23   ","Wall Street traders betting the Federal Reserve will be able to engineer a soft landing spurred a rally in riskier corners of the market, with stocks hitting all-time highs. Almost every major group in the S&P 500 gained, with the benchmark up 1.7% and poised for its 39th record this year. The Nasdaq 100 climbed 2.9% and the Russell 2000 of small caps extended its advance into a seventh straight session. Bitcoin jumped 5%. Bonds and the dollar fell. The Fed’s bold start to cutting interest rates and its determination not to fall behind the curve re-ignited hopes the central bank will be able to avoid a recession. Data Thursday showing a slide in jobless claims to the lowest since May signaled the labor market remains healthy despite a slowdown in hiring.  “Despite some volatility after the Fed’s rate cut, the S&P 500’s bullish trend remains intact,” said Fawad Razaqzada at City Index and Forex.com. “The Fed’s decision to deliver a 50-basis point rate cut was largely welcomed by investors. The move was seen as a bold but necessary step to ease economic concerns without sending panic signals reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis.” Still, with the S&P 500 up about 20% in 2024 year-to-date, investors are wondering if the rally can be sustained. “On the surface, it appears that market sentiment is bullish,” Razaqzada said. “Yet, looming risks, such as global economic slowdown in the Eurozone and China, may challenge this optimism. Moreover, seasonal trends indicate that September is typically a tough month for equities.” The S&P 500 topped 5,700 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered near 42,000. The yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced three basis points to 3.74%. The pound rose as the Bank of England held rates steady and said it won’t rush to ease policy. The yen fell ahead of the Bank of Japan policy decision.

"Zomato records 100% growth in brand value, MakeMyTrip enters list of top Indian firms",https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/zomato-records-100-growth-in-value-makemytrip-enters-list-of-top-indian-brands-article-12825659.html,general," September 19, 2024 / 20:39   ","Zomato emerged as this yearâ€™s fastest riser with a 100Â percent year-on-year growth in brand value at $3,549 due to its innovation and expansion into quick commerce, according to 'Kantar BrandZ Most Valuable Indian Brands' report. TheÂ brand doubled its value on the back of reducing friction for customers as well as building a strong desire among consumers for the brand. Meanwhile, travel platform MakeMyTrip made its debut in the list of top Indian brands after making marked improvement in customer experience. ""MakeMyTrip's entry in the list is driven by the fact that people are traveling more, and they are using travel websites more. But, the company has also reduced the friction in making bookings and finding destinations in the entire process of travel,"" saidÂ Soumya Mohanty, managing director & chief client officer, Insights, South Asia at Kantar, a marketing data and analytics company. Indiaâ€™s top 75 most valuable brands now have a combined value of $450.5 billion, marking a 19Â percent increase from last year. Brands across diverse business sectors fuelled this growth, with 54 brands boosting their brand value over the past year. This growth outpaces most other rankings globally and closely mirrors the 20Â percent increase seen in the global top 100 brands. TCS on top Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) retained its top position in the brand rankings for the third straight year with a brand value of $49.7 billion, up 16Â percent versus last year, driven by investments in innovation, particularly in AI and digital transformation. ""TCS remains on top due to its sheer financial size. For brandsÂ like TCS, Infosys, HCL Tech, SBI, a big part of their total value is just their sheer size. But all these brands are also doing a lot of activities in brand building. If you look at TCS, it sponsors multiple marathons, which is a way to get salience and brand name visibility,"" saidÂ Deepender Rana, executive managing director, Insights, South Asia at Kantar. Among categories, automotive has seen significant growthÂ along with financial services. Aspirational categories The automotive sector has also seen strong results, led by Maruti Suzuki with a 24Â percent growth in brand value, Bajaj Auto with 94Â percent increase, Mahindra with 78Â percent rise in brand value. Mahindra's SUVs (sport utility vehicle) make up 53Â percent of India's passenger car market as of June 2024. The success of models like XUV700, Scorpio N, and Thar, which continue to see high demand and long waiting periods, has solidified Mahindra's leadership in mid and premium SUVs. Rising disposable income and a growing middle class are driving demand for vehicles, shifting car ownership from a status symbol to a necessity. Improved infrastructure, government support for EVs and strong export growth expectations are further fueling the industry's momentum, the report said. ""I've seen a big uptick in what we call aspirational categories in the last few years. If you look at some of the top risers this year, there are sectors like automobiles where there was premiumization happening with SUVs. There's an uptick in travel and leisureÂ along withÂ real estate,"" saidÂ Rana. Strong bounce back He added that compared to pre-Covid, there's been a strong bounce back in brand value of top Indian firms. ""In the beginning of the post-Covid period, we saw a big pickup in some sectors like packaged goods. In the last year or so, we've seen the packaged goods sector slowing down a bit."" In 2020, the value of top 75 brands had dropped by 6 percent, while that of global brands had increased by 6 percent. Mohanty said that during Covid, while the value of top Indian brands had dropped,Â it has been growing faster in the post-Covid period. Some of the top brands, whether globally or in India, are outpacing the overall market growth because they have been investing in brand building, Mohanty said. ""There are two things that we see. One is what we call meaning. Meaning means you meet people's needs, but you also emotionally delight them. The brands that were growing faster than average are meaningful. The second aspect is whether a brand stands out isÂ seen as setting trends in a category. If a brand does well in these two aspects, a brand's valueÂ grows 27Â percent versus an average growth of 19Â percent. And if a brand doesn't meet expectations on these aspects, then they grow at 17Â percent. So, there are the aspects that brands can invest in to build equity that help them grow faster,"" Rana said. Invest in brand equity However, he noted thatÂ despite strong investor confidence, large brands face a looming challengeÂ of a long-term decline in demand power. While they may remain stock market favourites for now, they risk losing relevance in the minds of consumers if they don't adapt to shifting expectations, Rana said. ""Some of the brands in the top 75 in India are simply there because of the sheer size. If I look at the top 100 brands globally, 8Â percent can be classified as below average on meaning and (making a) difference. In India, that rises to 21Â percent. This means that these many brands in the top 75 are vulnerable to value decline. While Indian brands have grown well, they need to keep investing in brand equity,"" he said.

"BigBasket to launch 10-minute deliveries of electronics, starting with iPhone 16",https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/bigbasket-to-launch-quick-commerce-deliveries-of-electronics-starting-with-iphone-16-article-12825767.html,general," September 19, 2024 / 19:05   ","Tata-owned grocery delivery platform BigBasket, which recently announced a pivot to quick commerce, is making an entry into the consumer electronics category — starting with iPhone 16. The company said it is launching its electronics category in partnership with Croma, a Tata company, which will enable BigBasket to deliver mobile phones, laptops, PlayStation consoles, microwave and more, within 10 minutes. Hari Menon, co-founder and CEO of BigBasket, said, ""We are thrilled to bring the iPhone 16 to our platform, marking the beginning of our foray into the electronics space. This is just the start—very soon, we will be launching a wide range of top-tier electronics, all available with our lightning-fast delivery service.” Moneycontrol reported earlier that BBdaily, the subscription service from Tata’s BigBasket, which runs as a separate app currently will be merged into the main BigBasket app over the coming months as the company makes strides to consolidate its hold over India’s burgeoning quick commerce market. The company currently runs two apps: BigBasket (the main app) and BBdaily (the subscription service) but even within the main app, it has different windows. One for slotted 2-3 hour deliveries (BigBasket Supersaver) and the other one is for 10-20 minute deliveries (BBnow). However, BigBasket is doing away with the fragmented approach and is preparing to house all its offerings under a single app which will have no divisions in the coming months. The strategy is part of BigBasket’s larger move of entirely moving away from slotted 2-3 hour deliveries towards the 10-20 minute delivery model, and becoming a pure play quick commerce company, as customer preferences have evolved. Analysts at Kotak recently pegged quick commerce’s annualised gross merchandise value (GMV) at $5.5 billion – a stellar growth rate for a market that is just about three years old. The market is only heating up further. “Quick commerce (QC) industry is witnessing enhanced competitive intensity with new players such as Flipkart entering the fray and BigBasket pivoting to a full QC model. Over the next 12 months, we expect competitive intensity to rise as players add stores in similar geographies and discounting/price competition increases,” Kotak’s analysts said in a note to clients on August 30. “The three incumbents (Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart and Zepto), however, may witness more competition with new players (BigBasket, Flipkart and potentially Amazon) entering the fray.”

MC EXCLUSIVE,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/rpsg-group-sanjiv-goenka-interview-firstsource-spencers-12825388.html,general," September 19, 2024 / 15:12   ","The RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group is tweaking the offshore and onshore ratio to change the margin profile of Firstsource, Chairman Sanjiv Goenka told Moneycontrol on September 19. Chairman Sanjiv Goenka said Firstsource - the group's business process company - is also scouting for acquisitions in the US and UK, along with planning value-added services like Generative AI for its clients. Goenka added that Spencers Retail is aiming to break-even by March next year, and has plans to pivot towards quick commerce with 30-minute deliveries. Here's the edited excerpt of Sanjiv Goenka's conversation with Moneycontrol's Shweta Punj: What is Firstsource planning to do in Australia and what is it that you're offering to the Australian people? So, it's a beginning. It's a small beginning which we hope will become big. We start in Melbourne. We've been very encouraged by the response of the Melbourne administration, by the Victoria administration and there are a few large corporates headquartered there and we begin with providing services for them. And if we can continue to serve them well, we hope that this will grow. We don't want to restrict it to just one or two clients. We want to take it across all the companies there. What's the kind of investment and what's the kind of job creation expected? We've identified an office in Exhibition Street, which is the main street in the CBD there and to begin with, we'll create about 500 jobs in Melbourne. But as our business grows, we hope to expand on that. Any specific areas that you will be focusing on in terms of areas of expertise you will be offering to the Australian companies? As a service provider, it's about what your client needs and how you can add value to your client. But today, the buzzword is generative AI. How you can use technology to give services cheaper, to add value, to give pointed, focused feedback and service, and we've been in some key sectors in the western part of the world. We hope to take that to Australia as well. What's your growth outlook for Firstsource? And what are the markets that you're really betting on? Considering we have the US presidential elections coming, we're seeing a lot of protectionist noises coming from a big market like the United States of America. Are you looking at diversifying? You know, is that of concern to you? Yesterday, the US Fed raised rates by 50 basis points, that's a good step. It helps us in certain segments of our business, for example, the mortgage business. What we've adopted for the company are simple building blocks. We've built building blocks to grow our margins by 3 percent over the next 30 to 36 months and that is something that we are working on very aggressively. How do we take our growth rates to higher than industry? How do we mine our existing clients for a greater wallet share? So, of our 50 top business clients, we've had limited wallet share. Now, if we take that up to 8 percent or 10 percent, which is very doable, that in itself means an additional business of $550 million. And then we are changing the mix of onshore-offshore. We were very heavily skewed in terms of most of our businesses being onshore. If we shift that ratio and we are successfully beginning to do that, that in itself changes the margin profile. We've invested in good G&A and we are beginning to see the results of this investment by a way of additional business. We are making inroads into world majors. We're doing well on the healthcare space. We're doing well on the BFSI space. We're doing well on the telecom space. We've made a beginning in the generative AI space. So, we're getting into value-added spaces. We're looking at adding margins. We're looking at adding revenues. So, it's about how do we grow the company such that by 2028, we can increase our bottom lines by two and a half times. That is the focus. There are building blocks in place. We have a team that's driving the monitoring of each of these building blocks. So, it's about growing the business, growing margins and at the same time adding value to the customer. Simple. There's no great science in what we're doing. Yes, the science comes in technology, in the generative AI and those kind of spaces, but in terms of the building blocks, they're very simple blocks. So, when you mentioned that the ratio of onshore versus offshore has changed, what was it earlier? What is it now? So, can we say that generative AI is going to be one of your key focus areas for the next one or two years? Is that what you're betting on for growth? Generative AI is definitely going to be important for us. But what is equally important is to get the base business even more competitive than it is. So, we were significantly onshore and limitedly offshore. We have to change that ratio to the reverse. And we've made a beginning with one of our major telecom clients, or media clients rather. We've actually made a huge beginning and we've shared part of the upside of shifting the ratio with them. But it increases the margins overall. And the idea is to do this across clients. And when you can mine your existing clients for more business, you can generate additional margins. We had high attritions, we've cut down on those and we are going to cut down further. So, attrition is a high cost of operations. If you can reduce attrition, you can reduce your costs and thereby increase your margins. So, tapping into the Australian market, Australia and New Zealand, what kind of other acquisitions can we expect going forward? Any other international markets that you're looking at? And within India, what are your expansion plans looking like? So, we're expanding within India, we're expanding in South Africa, we're expanding in Australia, we're expanding in the US, we're expanding in the UK. We're looking at organic plus inorganic. And as we speak, there are multiple opportunities in the inorganic space that we're examining. But till they don't happen, they don't. Any geography that you can share with us? There are multiple geographies that we are looking at. But US, UK, South Africa, Australia, I think one or two geographies in Latin America. I think we're looking at expanding in all these. That's for Firstsource specifically. Okay, moving on from Firstsource, in terms of your retail business, Spencer's, we saw a whole host of stores shutting down. So what's next for your retail business? By March, the idea is to get to break even. So you cut down, you operate, we'll continue to operate in just two regions, which will be UP and East, (that's West Bengal), both of which are profitable for us. And we will close down the rest. So it's no more about vanity of becoming a national retailer, but revenues. It's about bottom lines. So with this, we expect to get to break even by March. And do we see the business pivoting maybe to quick commerce, e-commerce? It's happening. Quick commerce is also happening, but we're conscious that we don't do quick commerce purely for the sake of revenues or vanity, where we lose big sums of money. So it's a calibration between losses of that sector with revenues. Okay, so you are thinking of getting into the quick commerce space? How often do you really need something within 10 minutes? So, it depends on how you define quick commerce. Is the 10-minute space really a relevant space? We don't necessarily think so, but 30 minutes? Yes. Okay. And will you go about it in a greenfield way or will you be looking at making acquisitions in this space? No, we are not looking at making acquisitions in that space. Okay, and what stage are you at in getting into the quick commerce 30-minute delivery space? It's beginning to happen. It's slow. We will begin in selected geographies and we've started in the east. So we will use it in geographies that we operate in. Okay, any timelines that you're working with? Idea is to get to break even by March. In an interview you had said that the group's market cap could exceed Rs 2 lakh crore within the next two-and- a-half years. I want to get a sense of the markets that you are looking at, the sectors that you're betting on for that kind of growth to come in. Also at a time when the RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group companies are doing very well,  we do see a slowdown coming in in the IT sector. There's a very muted guidance for the sector. So I just want to get a sense of what's driving your optimism. It depends upon whether you believe Rs 2 lakh crore from Rs 85,000 crore is optimistic or not. I'm not so sure that's optimistic or it's challenging enough. It is challenging. We're going big on renewable energy and we expect a significant part of this is coming from the energy space. We are growing big in the chemical space. We're growing big in the carbon black space. We are getting into  chemicals which go into the EV batteries. Now that again, we expect to be a very big player contributor to this Rs 2 lakh crore. Firstsource, we expect to be another big contributor. So these three put together, we expect that 75 percent or 80 percent of the Rs 2 lakh crore will come from these three. Then you have music and the whole content in the IP business which is growing and the moment the music OTT channels turn pay, it will increase profitability very dramatically and that will increase valuations. We are growing as it is by 23 percent year-on-year which grows irrespective of anything else. We are number one in the content space. So we do expect music to grow significantly. We expect our sports vertical to grow. Valuations have grown and we expect valuations to double from here on. So if you actually just make the total additions, it comes to way more than 2 lakh crores. So 2 lakh to my mind is a conservative number. But that's based on the assumption that there is no bear run in the market. If you were to look at the investment climate in India, what's giving you optimism? What's giving you hope about the India story? And what reforms would you like to see Modi 3.0 deliver on to take the momentum forward? Well, the biggest confidence booster is Prime Minister Modi and his government. I'm a firm believer in the “Modi Hai Toh Mumkin Hai” theory and he is the one who inspires us to think big and you know, he gives us that confidence that you can grow, please grow. That is so good and that is so encouraging. And you can always ask for more, but I think the government has done enough, has done a lot in terms of policies and a lot in terms of ease of doing business. So if you ask me personally, there might be little things here or little things there, but overall I'm fairly happy with the environment that we have with the policies that we have, and I think it's now really up to us to go ahead, invest, grow. So in terms of your investment plans for within the country, any specific states that you're looking at and what's the kind of cap spending that we can expect and the job creation that we can expect coming in from within India? We would expect to invest about Rs 50,000 crore in the next few years and job creation is going to be humongous. I think we will add at least about 15,000 jobs to our existing 50,000. Yes, it's a very bullish phase for us. We will grow and grow very aggressively across all our segments and all our sectors, but it's based on very systematic solid plans which are worked at a very granular level. And any specific states that you're targeting or you're looking at expanding? We will go wherever opportunities present themselves, but we are very enthused by the opportunities that are presented in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh. Any numbers you can share with us, Mr. Goenka, on the investments we can expect? We are investing even in Tamil Nadu, even in Gujarat, even in Maharashtra, even in Uttar Pradesh. I continue to invest in my home state, West Bengal. So we're investing all over. We are setting up a new plant, a new carbon black plant in Andhra Pradesh. So we're growing actually literally wherever opportunities present themselves. So in UP, any timelines that you can share? Any specific area of interest? Well, power is certainly a very important area of interest. We already distribute electricity in the Greater Noida region and we do hope that we will be able to expand that. We want to get renewable power into UP and so, that's another area of growth that we're looking at. We're looking at setting up very major solar and wind projects in Rajasthan. So that's underway. We're looking at doing the same in Maharashtra, in Karnataka, in Tamil Nadu, in Gujarat. So we're literally growing all over.

The move comes following West Bengal government's appointment of Manoj Kumar Verma as the new Kolkata Police chief, replacing Vineet Goyal, and the removal of two senior health department officials, giving in to the medics' earlier demands. On September 19, Verma visited RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where a postgraduate trainee doctor was raped and murdered on August 9, sparking nationwide protests and prompting junior doctors of West Bengal to launch 'cease work'. Accompanied by Dipak Sarkar, who has replaced Abhishek Gupta as Deputy Commissioner of Police (North Division), Verma stayed at the hospital premises for over 30 minutes where he visited the scene of crime on the second floor of the Emergency block and met hospital authorities at the administrative building of the state-run tertiary healthcare facility. Yesterday, the doctors refused to end the strike, calling the state's administrative measures ""only partial victory"" of their movement.Â They had also demanded discussions on safety and security of doctors inside hospital premises and including a thorough rundown on how the government wants to spend the Rs 100 crore it has allocated for tightening doctors' safety in state-run hospitals.

"Beef fat, fish oil used in making laddus at Tirupati Temple: Lab report",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/beef-fat-fish-oil-used-in-making-laddus-at-tirupati-temple-lab-report-12825742.html,general," September 19, 2024 / 18:25   ","In a shocking revelation, a lab test report findings show beef tallow, fish oil and palm oil were being used to make the laddus - distributed as prasad - at the famous Sri Venkateswara temple in Tirupati. Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Wednesday alleged that substandard ingredients and animal fat were used in making the famous Tirupati laddu, a consecrated sweet, during the previous YSRCP government.  However, the party (YSRCP), has rejected the claim. The report, in its findings reveal that the ghee used to make the iconic Tirupati laddu prasadam during the previous YSRCP government contained traces of animal fat, including beef tallow and fish oil, sparking massive outrage and accusations of disrespecting religious sentiments. A report from the Centre of Analysis and Learning in Livestock and Food, or CALF, lab at Gujarat's National Dairy Development Board revealed the presence of animal fat in ghee used to produce the famed Tirupati laddoos when the YSRCP was in power. The report indicated the ghee contained traces of fish oil, beef tallow, and lard; the last is a semi-solid white fat product obtained by rendering the fatty tissue of a pig. The Tirupati laddu is distributed at the revered Sri Venkateswara temple in Tirupati, which is run by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD). During a party meeting on Wednesday, the chief minister claimed the laddu used to be made with substandard ingredients. State  IT minister Nara Lokesh also slammed the previous YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government over the issue. “The Lord Venkateswara Swamy temple at Tirumala is our most sacred temple.

Hezbollah claims 'Red Line' breached after deadly attack; Israel threatened with 'crushing response' by Iran,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/hezbollah-leader-says-attack-on-devices-crossed-red-line-vows-to-retaliate-against-israel-12825851.html,general," September 19, 2024 / 21:56   ","Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah has condemned Israel's recent attack on the group's communications devices as a severe blow and a breach of red lines. In a televised address, Nasrallah vowed continued strikes on northern Israel, asserting that Israelis would remain unable to return to their homes until the Gaza conflict ends. The remarks follow a series of unprecedented bombings that occurred this week, widely attributed to Israel. The attacks targeted pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah, resulting in at least 37 deaths and around 3,000 injuries across Beirut, parts of Lebanon, and Damascus. The explosions are seen as part of Israel’s strategic effort to incapacitate Hezbollah members and disrupt their operations. In response to the bombings, Israeli forces have intensified their strikes, with at least two Israeli soldiers confirmed dead in the skirmishes. Israeli warplanes have also carried out low-flying maneuvers over Beirut, adding to the city’s tensions. The ongoing exchanges have raised concerns about a potential escalation into full-scale war. Iran, a key ally of Hezbollah, has also reacted strongly. The Revolutionary Guards Commander Hossein Salami issued a statement threatening Israel with a “crushing response” from the “axis of resistance,” which includes Hezbollah and other Iran-aligned groups. Salami labeled the bombings as acts of desperation and failure by Israel and promised a retaliatory strike. The latest developments come amid a conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which began with a militant attack on October 7, 2023. The violence has seen significant casualties and displacement on both sides of the border. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has indicated a shift in focus to the northern front, suggesting a potential new phase in the conflict. Meanwhile, Lebanon continues to grapple with the aftermath of the bombings, with heightened security measures and ongoing investigations into the attacks. (With Agencies inputs)

"Why India needs to implement ‘One Nation, One Election’ policy",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/why-india-needs-to-implement-one-nation-one-election-policy-12825411.html,general," September 19, 2024 / 14:16   ","The Narendra Modi government has passed a cabinet resolution to pursue the ‘One Nation, One Election’ policy. If implemented, it isn’t going to be something new for the Indian polity. Elections to the Lok Sabha and legislative assemblies of states were mostly held simultaneously from 1951-52 to 1967. Interestingly, some of the state assemblies were dissolved in 1957 by the Congress government at the Centre to hold simultaneous polls, and this was done with consensus among all the political parties. The states whose assemblies were dissolved prior to completion of their term to facilitate simultaneous elections for the Lok Sabha and all state assemblies included Bihar, Bombay, Madras, Mysore, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. According to the ECI’s report on the Second General elections in India (Volume I), “The Commission called a conference of the All-India Political Parties in New Delhi on the November 13, 1956, to elicit their views on the most convenient period in February-March, 1957, for holding the general elections. The representatives of the political parties expressed themselves unanimously that the poll should be held continuously without any long break.” The ECI report in 1962 also advocated for simultaneous polls in concurrence with all the political parties. The Law Commission of India in its 170th Report on ‘Reforms of the Electoral Laws’ submitted way back in 1999, observed that: “This cycle of elections every year, and in the out of season, should be put an end to. We must go back to the situation where the elections to Lok Sabha and all the Legislative Assemblies are held at once. It is true that we cannot conceive or provide for all the situations and eventualities that may arise whether on account of the use of Article 356 (which of course has come down substantially after the decision of the Supreme Court in S.R. Bommai vs Union of India) or for other reasons, yet the holding of a separate election to a Legislative Assembly should be an exception and not the rule. The rule ought to be ‘one election once in five years for Lok Sabha and all the Legislative Assemblies.”  The Law Commission reports in 2015 and 2018 also favoured simultaneous polls.  The annual Report of Election Commission of India in 1983 also advocated for ‘One Nation One Election Policy’. In September, 1982 the Commission recommended holding simultaneous elections to the House of the People and the Legislative Assemblies of States for the following weighty reasons: (1) Considerable saving on the colossal avoidable administrative and other expenditure incurred on account of holding of separate General elections (2) Substantial economy through revision of electoral rolls for the House of the People and the State Legislative Assemblies simultaneously instead of undertaking them on a countrywide basis twice over in two different operations. (3) For the conduct of elections, civilian personnel running into about twenty-five lakhs of officers and staff and a few lakhs of police personnel are deployed every time for about two to three months thereby seriously affecting their normal duties. (4) During elections whether for the Lok Sabha or the Assemblies, the entire administrative set up throughout the country slows down considerably and all other normal functions and activities of the Government, including developmental work, are pushed to the background. These create a lot of hardships and sufferings to the common man. The situation con (6) On account of the de-linking of the General elections to the House of the People from that of the State Legislative Assemblies, there is a duplication of the expenditure incurred by the candidates and political parties which results in the pumping in of considerable resources, thereby indirectly affecting money supply in the economy. Further by such de-linking, the candidates at Parliamentary election need more money and resources to fight the election singlehanded over a wide area without the backing and co-operation of companion candidates of the assembly segments. This also, it is suspected, tends to lead to difficulties for the candidates in keeping within the ceiling for election expenses. (7) The dismantling of the temporary but complicated superstructure raised for the purpose of election by accretion of huge personnel is required to be done as speedily and smoothly as of putting up the super-structure, and normal conditions should be restored quickly. In this respect also, simultaneous elections would be highly desirable.  The ECI report said, “Having regard to the above considerations, the Commission is strongly of the view that a stage has come for evolving a system by convention, if it is not possible or feasible to bring about a legislation, under which the General elections to the House of the People and Legislative Assemblies of the States are held simultaneously. After all, such an arrangement worked immensely satisfactorily, generally speaking, prior to 1967.  National Commission to review the working of the Constitution headed by former Chief Justice of India M. N. Venkatachaliah recommended in the first volume of its report in 2002, “With a view to reducing election costs and strain on human and other resources, State and Parliamentary level elections, to the extent possible be held at the same time.” It is clear that several constitutional bodies have always been in favour of restoring the ‘One Nation, One Election’ principle that was followed till 1967. The imposition of a model code of conduct during polls which are held at different times has a severe impact on the governance as governments aren’t allowed to take important policy decisions. The common people of India have been bearing the burden of elections around the year for too long. "
How Canada's new visa restrictions will impact Indian students,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/how-canadas-new-visa-restrictions-will-impact-indian-students-12825755.html,general," September 19, 2024 / 21:54   ","The Canadian government announced a new set of restrictions for international students. It also said it would also tighten rules for foreign workers. “We’re granting 35% fewer international students permits this year. And next year, that number’s going down by another 10%. — but when bad actors abuse the system and take advantage of students, we crack down,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wrote on social media platform X.Were granting 35% fewer international student permits this year. And next year, that numbers going down by another 10%.Immigration is an advantage for our economy but when bad actors abuse the system and take advantage of students, we crack down.Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) September 18, 2024 The announcement comes amid the Trudeau government trying to reduce the number of foreign students and workers across the country. Canada will also limit the work permit of spouses of temporary foreign workers or students. What’s Trudeau’s rationale? Trudeau said Canada will grant 35 per cent fewer international student permits this year. The number will be reduced by another 10 per cent next year. ""Immigration is an advantage for our economy — but when bad actors abuse the system and take advantage of students, we crack down,"" said the Canadian PM. Uncontrolled immigration is said to be a burden on Canada’s housing, social services and ramped-up cost of living, even as post-pandemic inflation slowed to the Bank of Canada’s target of two per cent annually in August. Fraud within Canada’s international student system is another issue that has drawn attention. In 2023, many Indian students from Punjab faced deportation after it was discovered that their Canadian college offer letters were fake. Brijesh Mishra, an education consultant from India, was arrested in British Columbia for his alleged involvement in the case. The case affected hundreds of students between 2016 and 2020, and Canadian authorities have been investigating over 2,000 similar cases, according to reports. What do numbers say? According to data from the Immigration Department, Canada approved 5,09,390 permits in 2023 and 1,75,920 permits in the first seven months of 2024. This new move aims at reducing the number of international study permits in 2025 to 4,37,000. In 2023, the nation approved 509,390, and 175,920 in the first seven months of 2024. In January, Canada had also set a two -year limit on international students. According to reports, this led to a predicted 35 per cent reduction in student intake in 2024 compared to 2023. How will Indian students be impacted? Canada has been one of the favourite destinations of Indian students. According to central data released last month, about 13.35 lakh Indian students are studying abroad, with about 427,000 in Canada. It also stated that the number of Indian students moving to Canada saw a rise of 260 per cent between 2013 and 2022. According to Reuters, about 40 per cent of overseas students in Canada were from India in the earlier part of 2024. The latest move may now negatively impact the decision of selecting Canada as a preferred decision for study and work. The Canadian government’s move may now force Indian students to look for other options like the US, UK or Australia.

"Who is Mukesh Kumar Ahlawat, AAP's tactical pick as Delhi minister ahead of polls?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/who-is-mukesh-kumar-ahlawat-aaps-tactical-pick-as-delhi-minister-ahead-of-polls-12825776.html,general," September 19, 2024 / 19:17   ","The Aam Aadmi Party is set to induct Mukesh Ahlawat as a fresh face in the reconstituted Cabinet under Chief Minister Atishi. Of the five ministers set to take oath in the new AAP government, Ahlawat will be the only new face while four others will retain their posts. Atishi and her cabinet will take oath of office on September 21. Gopal Rai, Saurabh Bhardwaj, Kailash Gehlot, and Imran Hussain will continue in their roles. Ahlawat is likely to fill in the vacancy left by the resignation of Social Welfare Minister Raj Kumar Anand. Who is Mukesh Ahlawat? A first-time MLA from Delhi’s Sultanpur Majra constituency, is a Delhi native and did his schooling in Pitampura. A businessman by profession, he declared movable assets worth approximately Rs 60 lakh and immovable assets worth Rs 5.6 crore in his 2020 election affidavit. Having won the seat in 2020, he first contested elections on a BSP ticket in 2013 but lost. He subsequently joined the AAP and was fielded from the reserved seat in 2020. He replaced Sandeep Kumar, who was removed from the party and the Cabinet in 2016 amid outrage over a CD that purportedly showed him in a compromising position with a woman.Facing rape allegations, he received a clean-chit later. His stint as an MLA has seen Ahlawat emerge as a vocal and active face of the party, particularly after the arrest of former CM Arvind Kejriwal when he held community meetings to deliver “Kejriwal's message” to residents. The party’s co-in-charge for Rajasthan, he is likely to handle the Social Justice portfolio. Why AAP picked Mukesh Ahlawat as minister AAP’s choice of Ahlawat as a new entrant in the Delhi cabinet is a calculated move keeping the Delhi elections, scheduled to be held in February next year. Hailing from the Dalit community, AAP expects Ahlawat’s elevation to help recover any loss of face from the exit of two Dalit leaders from the party in recent months. While Raaj Kumar Anand, who served as the Social Welfare minister, quit ahead of the Lok Sabha polls and joined the BSP, another senior Dalit leader, Rajendra Pal Gautam went ahead and joined the Congress. Both had left the AAP accusing it of “neglecting Dalits”. With Assembly elections in Delhi less than five months away, the AAP would hope to have the support of all sections by its side. Dalits constitute a significant 12 percent of Delhi’s population and have been known to have supported AAP in previous elections. In the 2020 Assembly polls, the AAP had won all the 12 SC-reserved seats in Delhi.

India to be third largest economy by 2030-31; grow 6.7% per annum: S&P Global,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/india-to-be-third-largest-economy-by-2030-31-grow-6-7-per-annum-sp-global-12825747.html,general," September 19, 2024 / 18:29   ","The Indian economy will grow 6.7 percent annually between now and 2030-31 or become the third largest economy in the world, S&P Global said on September 19. “India’s medium-term prospects are healthy and filled with opportunities in multiple sectors including trade, agriculture, and AI, likely structural reforms and growing energy demands. India is poised for growth, and with a young and dynamic workforce well-positioned to shape the global economic landscape,” said Abhishek Tomar, Head- S&P Global India Leadership Council. S&P Global forecasts the Indian economy to grow 6.8 percent in the current fiscal. The economy grew 6.7 percent in the first quarter, buoyed by steady manufacturing and rise in the services economy. In the first edition of its report titled “ India Forward: Emerging Perspectives”, the global research firm noted that continued reforms were necessary to boost private investment and reduce reliance on public capital. India’s capex surge has largely been driven by public capex, which is expected to grow in double digits in FY25 as well. The report noted that the country needed to develop infrastructure and geopolitical strategies to maximise trade benefits and urged it to look for sustainable energy alternatives to cater to its growing population. “Addressing the twin challenges of air pollution and climate change will help deliver a high-quality, high-growth economy to the world’s largest democracy,” the report noted. It also pointed out the need to leverage AI to boost growth prospects further. ""The equity markets are expected to stay dynamic and competitive due to strong growth prospects and better regulation. Foreign inflows into Indian government bonds have surged since the country joined major emerging market indexes, with further growth anticipated,"" S&P Global stated. The report noted further noted there's a need to contain risks rising from food inflation, which may keep consumption muted. “Equally important is the limiting of food inflation by addressing structural bottlenecks and climate risks, as well as fostering conditions for supportive monetary policy,” it said. India’s food inflation rose again in August, leading to overall inflation rising to 3.65 percent compared with 3.6 percent in the previous month.

The Integral Coach Factory (ICF) invited a tender on September 5 to manufacture two chair-car high-speed trains. The stainless steel carbody trains will have a maximum speed of 280 kmph and an operational speed of 250 kmph. The last date for bid submission was September 19 (Thursday). Trainsets will be manufactured at BEML's plant in Bengaluru. U Subba Rao, general manager of ICF, Chennai, told Moneycontrol: “Only BEML has submitted the bid to manufacture two eight-car train sets, and the tender will be finalised in a week. Since it is a small order for just two trains, other rolling stock manufacturers were not keen to participate. Our target is to complete the manufacturing in 2.5 years.” While the exact amount quoted by BEML-Medha Servo Drives is unclear, it is likely in the range of Rs 200-Rs 250 crore per train. These trains will operate on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad High-Speed Rail (MAHSR) corridor, which is being developed by the National High-Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL).  Initially, Japanese Shinkansen trains (320Kmph operational speed) were expected to run on this line. However, due to the high price quoted by Japanese firms, Union railways ministry decided to develop high-speed trains domestically. “With BEML’s carbody building expertise and Medha’s propulsion system capabilities, an indigenous high-speed train meeting European standards can be built. Medha’s proven propulsion system is already powering the Vande Bharat trains, which run at a maximum speed of 160 Kmph,” said an official. Medha will now develop a propulsion system capable of 250 Kmph, while BEML will develop the carbody structure to withstand such speed. BEML-Medha is expected to hire a European design consultant for the project.

The train will have seven cars with a standard 3+2 seating arrangement and one executive car with 2+2 seating. “The total seating capacity is expected to be around 174. Depending on passenger demand, more cars could be added, extending the train to 12 or even 16 cars in the future. The trains will be built for standard gauge tracks, with an eye on export markets such as Southeast Asia and Africa,” the source said. Medha will manufacture the propulsion system and develop the Train Control and Management System (TCMS) software from its Hyderabad facility. BEML will handle final assembly and the rollout from its Bengaluru factory. “After successful trials, additional orders are likely for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad route and other upcoming high-speed rail lines, such as Delhi-Varanasi, Mumbai-Hyderabad, and Bengaluru-Chennai,” the official added.

In an interim order issued on September 19, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has also asked ACL to reply within 21 days to the observations made in the order. The regulator looked into the allegation that ACL extended itself beyond activities permitted to a merchant banker in the issue of listed non-convertible debentures (NCDs) of Sojo Infotel. According to the interim order passed by Sebi's Whole-time Member (WTM) Ashwani Bhatia, ""ACL provided guarantee/indemnity towards redemption of NCDs in the guise of underwriting, which it was not permitted to do under the existing regulatory framework. Such activity poses risk to the financial system as it can potentially disrupt the orderly functioning of the market."" Also read: Sebi aims to empower REIT investors with the launch of Data Benchmarking Institutions A merchant banker is allowed to take market risk while underwriting an issue. That is, it is allowed to subscribe or procure subscription for securities, issued or offered for sale, that remain unsubscribed. As the order states, ""Very clearly, the intent of the Regulations is to permit a Merchant Banker to take market risk by subscribing to the unsubscribed portion of the securities offered to the investors and to dispose of the securities so procured, by charging a fee."" But, through its arrangement with Sojo, ACL was undertaking a credit risk by providing credit-risk cover to the NCD subscribers, according to the order. According to the order, ACL's transaction with regard to Sojo's NCDs was not part of issue management but of security enforcement mechanism, which essentially falls under the domain of debenture trustee (which in this case was Axis DT or ACL's sister concern). As the order said, ""The whole transaction was, in substance, a structured secured credit transaction in the cloak of a capital market instrument (bonds) designed to finance an acquisition (of Lava International Ltd or LIL), which had adequate collateral / guarantees in the form of pledge of shares of Sojo and LIL, personal guarantees of promoters of Sojo, lien over escrow account and hypothecation of assets of Sojo. ACL’s credit support or credit enhancement, which was a credit guarantee in the guise of underwriting, was a critical component of the said structured credit transaction. ACL in this case was taking credit risk exposure, rather than market risk."" How did this work? For the NCD issue, a debenture trustee deed (DTD) was executed between Sojo, Axis Debenture Trustee (ADT) and ACL. Sojo had pledged the shares of LIL as security cover for the NCD issue. Under the DTD, if there a default, the debenture trustee would invoke a pledge. Then, according to the DTD, if ACL is not able to find buyers for the pledged shares, it would have to fulfil its ""underwriting commitment"", by having to purchase or fund the purchase of these pledged shares. As the order noted, ""ACL was unconditionally, unequivocally and irrevocablyobligated to purchase or fund the purchase of the Pledged Shares."" The order stated, "" The commitment provided by ACL in respect of NCDs of Sojo cannot be termed as an underwriting activity as it was not an agreement to “subscribe to or procure subscription for securities, issued or offered for sale, remaining unsubscribed.” Rather, it was a guarantee to redeem the NCDs of Sojo in the event of default on maturity. It is pertinent was noted that the CRAs (CRISIL / ICRA) had rated and assigned CE ratings to all of the above mentioned issuances on the basis of the guarantee/indemnity provided by ACL which was legally enforceable, irrevocable and unconditional covering the entire amount and full tenure of the rated instrument."" The order taking these and various other facts into consideration stated that "" in the instant case, ACL went beyond the mandate of issue management, as the activity undertaken by ACL was in contravention of the definition of underwriting and the role of Merchant Banker as defined in MB Regulations, 1992.

The decisions regarding all water releases are taken by a committee, which has members from West Bengal and Jharkhand governments and other central and DVC officials. The clarification came following West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's claim earlier in the day, throwing a ‘conspiracy’ charge at the Centre for failing to carry out dredging at the DVC dams, which released water that led to floods in several districts of the state. The Bengal CM also threatened to sever all the ties with the corporation. “All releases are as advised by the Damodar Valley Reservoir Regulation Committee (DVRRC), which has representatives from Govt of W Bengal, Govt of Jharkhand, Central Water Commission (Member Secretary) and from DVC,” the ministry said in a post on X.DVC on its own does not take decision regarding release of excess water during heavy rain period.Ministry of Power (@MinOfPower) September 19, 2024 The ministry further said that the Tenughat Dam, which released 85,000 cusecs water exacerbating the flood, is operated by the Jharkhand government, and is not under the control of DVC. Banerjee held the DVC should be held accountable for the ""man-made"" flood and suggested there was a conspiracy behind the situation in the state. DVC dams are located at Maithon and Panchet, both along the Jharkhand-Bengal border. ""This is not rainwater; it is water released by the central government organisation DVC from its dams. This is a man-made flood, and it's unfortunate. Why isn’t the central government dredging the DVC dams, where the water storage capacity has decreased by 36 percent. There is a larger conspiracy at play. This cannot continue and we will start a major movement against this,"" she added. Banerjee claimed the DVC released 5.5 lakh cusecs of water this year, contributing to the current crisis. ""I will instruct the administration to ensure that everyone receives adequate relief materials,"" she added. From Pashkura, Banerjee is scheduled to visit flooded areas in Hooghly and Howrah, according to government sources. Since Wednesday, she has been touring various parts of the state affected by the floods. (With PTI inputs) "

The foundation was laid by the Hon'ble PM on Feb 1, 2023, merely as a show of intent. Not a single acre of land was acquired till our government came to power. Of the 1,700+ acres required, we have already completed 80% of the acquisition (1,450+ acres), and the project is progressing rapidly. With 250 acres already state-owned, the remaining acquisition will be completed swiftly. We donâ€™t just talk; we deliver."" Patil further stated, ""The mismanagement of Bengaluru is the legacy of the previous BJP government, which damaged the stateâ€™s reputation.

Weâ€™ve always been at the forefront of technological and industrial advancements. So why were we excluded from the list of 12 Industrial Smart Cities? Why was Karnataka not given a Defence Corridor, despite contributing 63% of Indiaâ€™s aerospace and defence output? Why were semiconductor companies, which had shown interest in Karnataka, redirected to other states after reaching Delhi? Why is there always bias in the allocation of funds and the release of Karnatakaâ€™s rightful share? And many more..."" ""While these questions remain unanswered, Karnataka is rebuilding investor confidence and continues to lead in attracting GCCs, fostering innovation, and driving growth. #KHIRCity #InspiringInnovation #ReimaginingGrowth,"" Patil added.

According to media reports, Bishnoi was admitted two weeks ago for a stomach surgery at Jodhpurâ€™s Vasundhara Hospital, where the alleged botch-up took place. Soon after the surgery, Bishnoiâ€™s health worsened and could not recover, her family said. The Jodhpur SDM lost her life because of the â€˜carelessnessâ€™ of doctors at Vasundhara Hospital, Sahiram Bishnoi, the womanâ€™s father-in-law told ETV Bharat, demanding strict action. Media reports said that Bishnoi had complained of stomach pain almost 20 days ago, following which she was admitted to the hospital in Jodhpur, where she was allegedly given â€˜highâ€™ dose of anesthesia. As her condition deteriorated, the SDM was taken to CIMS hospital in Ahmedabad, where she later died. Who was Priyanka Bishnoi? Bishnoi, who was a 2016 RAS batch officer, was born on August 8, 1981 in Bikaner to a lawyer father. She was married to Vikram Bishnoi, an excise inspector, reports said. She was often witnessed in traditional Rajasthani attire while on duty and was honoured by the state government for public service on August 15. Probe ordered The death sparked a massive outrage in the state, especially among the Bishnoi community and on social media platforms. Taking cognizance of the protests, the district administration ordered the setup of a committee to probe the allegations, reports said. Chief minister Bhajan Lal Sharma also expressed grief over the death and ordered an inquiry. Meanwhile, the hospital administration denied all allegations of negligence, saying there was no medical complication in the treatment. They further said that a â€˜problemâ€™ was detected during her tests and she was â€˜under stressâ€™ before the surgery.

Melinda French Gates believes CEOs who sleep less to work more are ‘so dumb’,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/melinda-french-gates-believes-ceos-who-sleep-less-to-work-more-are-so-dumb-12825821.html,general," September 19, 2024 / 20:52   ","Melinda French Gates has recently said that she believes it’s “so dumb” to sleep for fewer hours so that they can put in extra hours at work. Commenting on the men she has encountered who claim to sleep three or four hours a night, the billionaire philanthropist told Vanity Fair,  “Some of us didn’t want to be around them! Let’s be honest!” French Gates added that she aims to sleep for seven or eight hours every night. Interestingly, her ex-husband and fellow billionaire Bill Gates was in his youth influenced by other entrepreneurs bragging about not needing enough sleep, leading him to believe that “sleep is laziness and unnecessary”. He admitted it  and said that now, he aims for a minimum of seven hours of sleep each night. ""[I] would be like, ‘I only sleep six hours.’ And the other guy says, ‘I only sleep five!’ and ‘Well, sometimes I don’t sleep at all,"" Gates, 68, said on his Unconfuse Me with Bill Gates podcast last year. “I’d be like, ‘Wow, those guys are so good. I need to try harder, because sleep is laziness and unnecessary.’” The Microsoft co-founder, however, changed his habits after his father was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, prompting him to start learning about brain health, he said. “One of the strongest things to emerge in [the Alzheimer’s] area is the importance of good sleep,” Gates said. “It’s one of the most predictive factors of any dementia, including Alzheimer’s, whether you’re getting good sleep.” Among other business leaders, the richest person in the world, Elon Musk, once used to brag about pulling all-nighters and sleeping under his desk as his electric vehicle company Tesla tried to meet its production goals. But speaking to CNBC last year, he said he since changed his habits and tries to sleep for at least six hours every night. Former PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi had said in 2018 that she typically worked until midnight and woke up at 4 am.

In a televised address, Nasrallah vowed continued strikes on northern Israel, asserting that Israelis would remain unable to return to their homes until the Gaza conflict ends. The remarks follow a series of unprecedented bombings that occurred this week, widely attributed to Israel. The attacks targeted pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah, resulting in at least 37 deaths and around 3,000 injuries across Beirut, parts of Lebanon, and Damascus. The explosions are seen as part of Israel’s strategic effort to incapacitate Hezbollah members and disrupt their operations. In response to the bombings, Israeli forces have intensified their strikes, with at least two Israeli soldiers confirmed dead in the skirmishes. Israeli warplanes have also carried out low-flying maneuvers over Beirut, adding to the city’s tensions. The ongoing exchanges have raised concerns about a potential escalation into full-scale war. Iran, a key ally of Hezbollah, has also reacted strongly. The Revolutionary Guards Commander Hossein Salami issued a statement threatening Israel with a “crushing response” from the “axis of resistance,” which includes Hezbollah and other Iran-aligned groups. Salami labeled the bombings as acts of desperation and failure by Israel and promised a retaliatory strike. The latest developments come amid a conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which began with a militant attack on October 7, 2023. The violence has seen significant casualties and displacement on both sides of the border. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has indicated a shift in focus to the northern front, suggesting a potential new phase in the conflict. Meanwhile, Lebanon continues to grapple with the aftermath of the bombings, with heightened security measures and ongoing investigations into the attacks. (With Agencies inputs)

Israeli military says it is striking Hezbollah targets in Lebanon,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/israeli-military-says-it-is-striking-hezbollah-targets-in-lebanon-12825835.html,World," September 19, 2024 / 20:50   ","The Israeli military said it was striking Hezbollah targets in Lebanon on Thursday, shortly before the movement's leader was due to give a speech. It also said the military chief of staff had approved plans for Israel's north, which borders Lebanon. The military said Hezbollah had turned southern Lebanon into a combat zone. ""For decades, Hezbollah has weaponized civilian homes, dug tunnels beneath them, and used civilians as human shields,"" it said. ""The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) is operating to bring security to northern Israel in order to enable the return of residents to their homes, as well as to achieve all of the war goals,"" it said. A separate military statement said that the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, had recently completed approval of plans for theÂ northernÂ arena. The statements were released a few minutes before Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah was due to deliver a speech for the first time since thousands of explosions in booby-trapped radios and pagers hit the Iran-backed Lebanese group. The attacks on Hezbollah's communications equipment killed 37 people and wounded around 3,000, raising fears that a full-blown war was imminent. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind the attacks but multiple security sources have said they were carried out by its spy agency Mossad.

Inside Mossad: How Israel’s covert operations target enemies,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/inside-mossad-how-israels-covert-operations-target-enemies-12825786.html,World," September 19, 2024 / 19:37   ","In a devastating turn of events, Lebanon was rocked by a series of deadly explosions over two days, leaving a trail of destruction and heartache. The attacks, believed to be orchestrated by Israel, targeted Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group that has been responsible for rocket attacks on northern Israel. The explosions, which occurred in homes, offices, and even during funerals, were triggered by pagers and two-way radios used by Hezbollah militants. The scale of the devastation, coupled with the precision of the attacks, pointed to a meticulously planned operation by Israeli intelligence. At least 30 people were killed, and thousands were injured in these explosions. The attacks have left Hezbollah reeling, stunned by the devastating blow dealt by Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad. According to a New York Times report, an operation targeting Hezbollah involved pagers, once seen as secure, being turned into weapons. The chaos began at 3:25pm on Tuesday when two Hezbollah members' pagers exploded at a mall, followed by another blast at a Hezbollah office. Within minutes, hundreds of pagers across Lebanon and Syria detonated nearly simultaneously. Eyewitnesses described scenes of utter chaos: “men flying off motorcycles, shoppers collapsing in agony, smoke snaking from pockets.” The report quoted Mohammed Awada, 52, “My son went crazy and started to scream when he saw the man's hand flying away from him.” The attacks disrupted public spaces and penetrated Hezbollah’s infrastructure, including explosions at a funeral for earlier victims. Sophisticated Israeli Operation According to the New York Times, Israel executed a sophisticated operation using a front company, BAC Consulting, purportedly a Hungary-based firm contracted by Taiwan’s Gold Apollo to produce pagers. In reality, it was an Israeli intelligence ploy. The pagers, which Hezbollah thought would protect them from surveillance, contained batteries laced with the explosive PETN. The deception was so meticulous that even the company’s website and LinkedIn profiles were convincingly crafted. The operation didn't stop there. The next day, walkie-talkies and other electronic devices used by Hezbollah exploded, showing a multi-layered strategy. Though Israeli officials have not confirmed their involvement, it's widely believed that Mossad orchestrated the attacks. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant announced a “new phase” in the conflict, stating, “The center of gravity is shifting to the north by diverting resources and forces.” An Israeli general added, “We have many capabilities that we haven’t yet activated,” signalling a stern warning to Hezbollah. Some Operations conducted by Mossad Operation Wrath of God (1972-1979): Israel targeted individuals responsible for Munich Olympics attack Capture of Adolf Eichmann (1960): Nazi war criminal abducted from Argentina Operation Entebbe (1976): Hostage rescue operation in Uganda Stuxnet Cyber Attack (2008): Iran's nuclear programme disrupted Theft of Iran's nuclear Secrets (2018): Mossad stole documents from Tehran Assassination of Imad Mugniyeh (2008): Killed Hezbollah commanderMossad’s Precision and Strategic Intent The recent attacks on Hezbollah are not an isolated incident. Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, has a long history of conducting covert operations, including assassinations and sabotage missions. The agency has gained a reputation for its surgical precision in targeting high-profile individuals, such as Iranian nuclear scientists and Hezbollah leaders. According to a Foreign Policy report, Mossad’s pager attack on Hezbollah was driven by the need to restore its “omnipotent and omnipresent” image, especially after the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July. The attack signals that Israel might be preparing for war with Hezbollah. Since October 7th, 2023, Hezbollah's rocket fire into Israel has intensified, escalating tensions at the northern border. According to the report, the pager explosions were likely meant to disrupt Hezbollah’s infrastructure and send a message that Israel could strike at any time. A retired Israeli military official remarked, “Why didn’t we do it for 11 months? Because we were not willing to go to war yet. What’s happening now? Israel is ready for war.” The attack has delayed Hezbollah’s operations, forcing the group to repair its communication network and investigate potential infiltrators. Despite this tactical victory, Israel still faces the challenge of containing threats from Hezbollah, Hamas, and Iran without triggering a wider regional conflict. For Hezbollah, the incident highlights its vulnerability to Israeli intelligence. Regional Tensions The aftermath of the pager attacks has left Hezbollah in a state of paranoia, as thousands of its operatives’ secret affiliations were exposed to family and neighbours, eroding trust within the group and its civilian base. This incident could heighten tensions in Lebanon, raising concerns about the vulnerability of imported electronics. Iranian-aligned militias are now worried that more devices—phones, tablets, radios—could be similarly compromised. As Lebanon deals with this tragedy, the region risks a broader conflict. The attacks might signal a larger campaign against Hezbollah or be a strategic move in the ongoing geopolitical struggle. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remark about returning northern residents safely hints at potential further action. The line between peacetime and war, and between civilian technology and weapons, is increasingly blurred. As one Lebanese woman warned, “Turn off your phones now!”—highlighting the new reality where even everyday devices can become instruments of war. (Inputs from agencies)

Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Oikya Parishad's leader Nirmal Rozario called for an independent and impartial investigation of communal violence under the supervision of the United Nations, the Daily Star newspaper reported. A total of 2,010 incidents of communal violence took place in 68 out of 76 districts and metropolitan areas across the country between August 4 and 20, resulting in the deaths of nine people, Nirmal Rozario, one of the vice-presidents of the organisation, was quoted as saying by the paper. Giving details of the communal violence during the political turmoil that ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Nirmal said that 1,705 families were directly affected by the violence. Among them, 157 families had their homes attacked, looted, vandalised, and set on fire. Some of their businesses were also looted, vandalised, and torched, he said at a press conference at Dhaka Reporters Unity. Nirmal said that these families are now living in dire conditions. He said that Khulna division saw the most violence, where four women were raped. Out of the 1,705 affected families, 34 belonged to indigenous communities and the lands of some of the families were occupied, he said. Additionally, 69 places of worship were attacked, vandalised, looted, and set ablaze during the communal violence, the newspaper reported. Nirmal called for an independent and impartial investigation of communal violence under the supervision of the United Nations. He also demanded the withdrawal of false cases against the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Oikya Parishad's general secretary Rana Dasgupta and other leaders, end of ongoing communal violence, and the arrest and punishment of the perpetrators. He also announced a nationwide protest and rally on Saturday across the country, including Dhaka, to press their demands. Bangladesh's interim government on Tuesday granted magisterial powers to the Army for two months to improve law and order in the violence-hit country and prevent ""subversive acts"". Home Adviser Lt Gen (retd.) Md. Jahangir Alam Chowdhury said on Wednesday that the ""people of Bangla (Bangladesh) will reap the benefit of bestowing the magistracy power upon the commissioned officers of Bangladesh Army."" ""We are witnessing subversive acts and disrupted stability in several places, especially in the industrial areas across the country. Given the situation, Army personnel have been given magistracy power,"" Law Adviser Asif Nazrul said. He added that he believed the army personnel would not misuse this authority. Many police personnel in Bangladesh have been absent on the streets since the fall of the Sheikh Hasina-led government. Bangladesh witnessed incidents of violence against members of Hindu, Buddhist and Christian communities following the fall of the Hasina-led Awami League government last month. Hasina resigned and fled to India on August 5 following unprecedented anti-government student-led protests over a controversial quota system in government jobs. Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, 84, who is leading the interim government as its Chief Advisor, last month met the Hindu community leaders and vowed to promote interfaith harmony.

Russia has since this summer regularly announced the capture of new villages in eastern Ukraine. The defence ministry said its forces had ""liberated the village of Georgievka,"" around 30 kilometres (20 miles) west of Donetsk city, the regional capital under Russian control. The village lies between Marinka, which fell to Russian forces at the end of last year and Ukrainian-controlled Kurakhove, in an area of the front that has not moved much in weeks. It also lies south of the town of Krasnogorivka, which Moscow said it captured last week. Further north in the Donetsk region, Russia has been pressing to capture the town of Pokrovsk, advancing fast in the area since the summer. The Russian advance in the east comes as Kyiv has for more than a month controlled swathes of Russia's Kursk region. Ukraine said Thursday that Russian shelling killed two civilians in the Sumy region, which borders the Kursk region.

The Taiwanese government's Mainland Affairs Council said the ban, which takes effect next week, ignores rules laid out by the World Trade Organization, of which both sides are members. The move comes amid growing military, political and economic pressure on Taiwan's government to concede to Beijing's control. Taiwan's semi-tropical climate and fertile soil have nurtured an agricultural industry valued at around $500 billion dollars, alongside high-tech corporations that produce the world's most cutting-edge computer chips. China's move “harms the interests of farmers” on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and does nothing to improve relations between the two, the council said. China and Taiwan should seek dialogue through the WTO to resolve their differences, it added. The WTO is one of the few forums through which discussion is possible between the two sides, which divided amid civil war in 1949. Chinese diplomatic pressure has barred Taiwan from the United Nations and reduced its number of official diplomatic allies to 12. The Chinese ban appears to target rural Taiwanese, who for the past two decades have largely voted for pro-independence candidates but whose local officials have been courted by China with all-expense vacations and other enticements. China has used trade pressure on countries such as Australia, South Korea and Norway over perceived political slights, using its market for resources and consumer goods as leverage, with mixed results.

What to know about the two waves of deadly explosions that hit Lebanon and Syria,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/what-to-know-about-the-two-waves-of-deadly-explosions-that-hit-lebanon-and-syria-12825549.html,World," September 19, 2024 / 15:59   ","Just one day after pagers used by hundreds of members of the militant group Hezbollah exploded, more electronic devices detonated in Lebanon Wednesday in what appeared to be a second wave of sophisticated, deadly attacks that targeted an extraordinary number of people. Both attacks, which are widely believed to be carried out by Israel, have hiked fears that the two sides’ simmering conflict could escalate into all-out war. This week's explosions have also deepened concerns about the scope of potentially compromised devices, particularly after such bombings have killed or injured so many civilians. Here's what we know so far. On Tuesday, pagers used by hundreds of Hezbollah members exploded almost simultaneously in parts of Lebanon as well as Syria. The attack killed at least 12 people — including two young children — and wounded thousands more. An American official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Israel briefed the U.S. on the operation — where small amounts of explosives hidden in the pagers were detonated. The Lebanese government and Iran-backed Hezbollah also blamed Israel for the deadly explosions. The Israeli military, which has a long history of sophisticated operations behind enemy lines, declined to comment. A day after these deadly explosions, more detonations triggered in Beirut and parts of Lebanon Wednesday — including several blasts heard at a funeral in Beirut for three Hezbollah members and a child killed by Tuesday's explosions, according to Associated Press journalists at the scene. At least 20 people were killed and another 450 were wounded, the Health Ministry said, in this apparent second attack. When speaking to troops on Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant made no mention of the explosions of electronic devices, but praised the work of Israel's army and security agencies and said “we are at the start of a new phase in the war."" A Hezbollah official told the AP that walkie-talkies used by the group exploded on Wednesday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. Lebanon’s official news agency also reported that solar energy systems exploded in homes in several areas of Beirut and in southern Lebanon, wounding at least one girl. While details are still emerging from Wednesday's attack, the second wave of explosions targeted a country that is still reeling from Tuesday's pager bombings. That attack appeared to be a complex Israeli operation targeting Hezbollah, but an enormous amount of civilian casualties were also reported, as the detonations occurred wherever members' pagers happened to be — including homes, cars, grocery stores and cafes. Hezbollah has used pagers as a way to communicate for years. And more recently, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah warned the group’s members not to carry cellphones, saying they could be used by Israel to track the group’s movements. Pagers also run on a different wireless network than mobile phones, which usually makes them more resilient in times of emergency. And for a group like Hezbollah, the pagers provided a means to sidestep what’s believed to be intensive Israeli electronic surveillance on mobile phone networks in Lebanon — as pagers' tech is simpler and carries lower risks for intercepted communications. Elijah J. Magnier, a Brussels-based veteran and a senior political risk analyst who says he has had conversations with members of Hezbollah and survivors of the attack, said that the newer brand of pagers used in Tuesday’s explosions were procured more than six months ago. How they arrived in Lebanon remains unclear. Taiwanese company Gold Apollo said Wednesday it had authorized use of its brand on the AR-924 pager model — but that a Budapest, Hungary-based company called BAC Consulting KFT produced and sold the pagers. Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs said that it had no records of direct exports of Gold Apollo pagers to Lebanon. And Hungarian government spokesman later added that the pager devices had never been in Hungary, either, noting that BAC had merely acted as an intermediary. Speculation around the origins of the devices that exploded Wednesday has also emerged. A sales executive at the U.S. subsidiary of Japanese walkie-talkie maker Icom told The Associated Press that the exploded radio devices in Lebanon appear to be a knock-off product and not made by Icom. “I can guarantee you they were not our products,” said Ray Novak, a senior sales manager for Icom’s amateur radio division, in an interview Wednesday at a trade show in Providence, Rhode Island. Novak said Icom introduced the V-82 model more than two decades ago and it has long since been discontinued. It was designed for amateur radio operators and for use in social or emergency communications, including by people tracking tornadoes or hurricanes, he said. Tuesday's explosions were most likely the result of supply-chain interference, several experts told The Associated Press — noting that very small explosive devices may have been built into the pagers prior to their delivery to Hezbollah, and then all remotely triggered simultaneously, possibly with a radio signal. That corroborates information shared from the U.S. official. A former British Army bomb disposal officer explained that an explosive device has five main components: A container, a battery, a triggering device, a detonator and an explosive charge. “A pager has three of those already,” said the ex-officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he now works as a consultant with clients on the Middle East. “You would only need to add the detonator and the charge.” This signals involvement of a state actor, said Sean Moorhouse, a former British Army officer and explosive ordinance disposal expert. He added that Israel’s foreign intelligence agency, the Mossad, was the most obvious suspect to have the resources to carry out such an attack. Israel has a long history of carrying out similar operations in the past. The specifics of Wednesday's explosions are still uncertain. But reports of more electronic devices exploding may suggest even greater infiltration of boobytrap-like interference in Lebanon’s supply chain. It also deepens concerns around the lack of certainty of who may be holding rigged devices. It would take a long time to plan an attack of this scale. The exact specifics are still unknown, but experts who spoke with the AP about Tuesday's explosions shared estimates ranging anywhere between several months to two years. The sophistication of the attack suggests that the culprit has been collecting intelligence for a long time, explained Nicholas Reese, adjunct instructor at the Center for Global Affairs in New York University’s School of Professional Studies. An attack of this caliber requires building the relationships needed to gain physical access to the pagers before they were sold; developing the technology that would be embedded in the devices; and developing sources who can confirm that the targets were carrying the pagers. Citing conversations with Hezbollah contacts, Magnier said the group is currently investigating what type of explosives were used in the device, suspecting RDX or PETN, highly explosive materials that can cause significant damage with as little as 3-5 grams. They are also questioning whether the device had a GPS system allowing Israel to track movement of the group members. N.R. Jenzen-Jones, an expert in military arms who is director of the Australian-based Armament Research Services, added that “such a large-scale operation also raises questions of targeting"" — stressing the number of causalities and enormous impact reported so far. “How can the party initiating the explosive be sure that a target’s child, for example, is not playing with the pager at the time it functions?” he said.

Apple gets EU warning to open up iPhone operating system,https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/apple-gets-eu-warning-to-open-up-iphone-operating-system-article-12825537.html,World," September 19, 2024 / 15:37   ","Apple Inc. has been warned by the European Union to open up its highly guarded iPhone and iPad operating systems to rival technologies, or eventually risk significant fines under its flagship digital antitrust rules. EU watchdogs announced under the bloc’s Digital Markets Act that the Cupertino, California-based firm must step into line with strict new laws on making operating systems fully functional with other technologies. The Brussels-based authority gave the company six months to comply, or face the threat of future penalties. While the announcement is a step shy of being a formal investigation, the EU aims to compel Apple to re-engineer its services to allow rival companies to access the iPhone’s and iPad operating systems. “Today is the first time we use specification proceedings under the DMA to guide Apple towards effective compliance with its interoperability obligations,” EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. “Effective interoperability, for example with smartphones and their operating systems, plays an important role in this.” Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The EU announcement confirms an earlier report by Bloomberg. One of the aims of the DMA is to ensure that other developers can gain access to key Apple features, such as its Siri voice commands and its payments chip. The EU may later decide to launch a formal probe if Apple doesn’t step into line with the DMA, which could eventually lead to hefty fines of up to 10% of global annual sales. It is already facing a parallel investigation into its App Store rules for developers, which could also lead to hefty penalties. Earlier this month, Apple announced the latest version of its flagship device, the iPhone 16, betting it can entice consumers with modest hardware upgrades and AI technology that’s still on the horizon. But in June, the US giant said that certain features — including Apple Intelligence, iPhone Mirroring and SharePlay Screen Sharing — would be held back from the EU, due to the DMA’s requirements on operating systems to work with third-party apps.

Israel arrests citizen allegedly recruited by Iran to kill Netanyahu,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/israel-arrests-citizen-allegedly-recruited-by-iran-to-kill-netanyahu-12825530.html,World," September 19, 2024 / 16:39   ","Israel's police arrested an Israeli citizen allegedly recruited by Iranian intelligence to plot the assassinations of top Israeli officials including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a joint statement by the police and Shin Bet said Thursday. ""An Israeli citizen was recruited by Iranian intelligence to promote assassinations of Israeli figures. He was smuggled twice into Iran and received payment for carrying out missions,"" the statement said. It said that Netanyahu, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar as well as other top officials were among the targets. The Israeli citizen, ""a businessman who lived in Turkey for an extended period,"" maintained connections with Turkish and Iranian individuals who introduced him by phone to an Iranian businessman called Eddie, the police said. They said the Israeli -- reported by local media to be a Jewish person from the city of Ashkelon -- first visited Iran in May 2024 to meet Eddie, after he had ""difficulty leaving"" Iran. He also met someone called Hajjah, who was introduced as an Iranian security operative. The police said he was asked during this trip to carry out security missions in Israel, including transferring ""money or a gun"", taking pictures of crowded public places and threatening other Israelis recruited by Tehran. In August, the investigation found, the arrested man was smuggled to Iran in a lorry. While there ""he met with additional Iranian intelligence agents and was asked by them to carry out terrorist activities for Iran on Israeli soil, including promoting assassination attacks"". Some of the proposed assassinations were characterised as being revenge for the killing of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July. Iran and Hamas have accused Israel of being behind Haniyeh's death. Israel has not commented on the killing. The suspect was also asked to perform additional tasks, including recruiting members of Israel's Mossad spy agency to be double agents, police said. After asking for a $1 million advance, the Israeli individual was given 5,000 euros for taking part in the meetings and told he would be contacted in the future. ""This is a very serious case that exemplifies the enormous efforts of Iranian intelligence agents to recruit Israeli citizens to promote terrorist activities in Israel"", a senior Shin Bet official was quoted as saying.

"Decline in Asian American enrollment at Princeton, Yale, and Duke sparks legal scrutiny: Report",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/decline-in-asian-american-enrollment-at-princeton-yale-and-duke-sparks-legal-scrutiny-report-12825490.html,World," September 19, 2024 / 15:13   ","There has been a notable decline in the enrollment of Asian American in three universities - Princeton, Yale and Duke this year compared with last year, according to an advocacy group- Students for Fair Admissions, a News York Times report said. The revelation surfaced after Students for Fair Admissions sent letters to the schools on Tuesday their compliance with the Supreme Court's recent ruling on admissions. Earlier, the group had sued Harvard to end affirmative action in university admissions last year. It now aims to scrutinize whether schools are adhering to the new regulations and to file lawsuits if it believes that they are not. The group, a nonprofit opposing race-based admissions that represented Asian students in the lawsuit against Harvard, appears poised to act as an enforcer of the court's ruling. Additionally, the report noted slight changes in Black and Hispanic enrollment at Princeton, Yale, and Duke in the first class admitted since the Supreme Court struck down race-conscious admissions policies. The letters signed by the president of Students for Fair Admissions, Edward Blum stated, “Based on S.F.F.A.’s extensive experience, your racial numbers are not possible under true neutrality,”, adding ,“You are now on notice. Preserve all potentially relevant documents and communications.” Following the threats of the advocacy group, William Jacobson, a Cornell law professor and founder of the Equal Protection Project, suggested that the fight will now move away from policies to what is happening in the admission offices. Meanwhile, responding to the outfit's letters, a spokeswoman for Princeton on Tuesday said that the varsity has 'carefully adhered to the rules set by the Supreme Court.'

Israel-Hamas war latest: Israel turns its focus north toward Lebanon and Hezbollah,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/israel-hamas-war-latest-israel-turns-its-focus-north-toward-lebanon-and-hezbollah-12825363.html,World," September 19, 2024 / 13:25   ","Israel’s defense minister has declared the start of a “new phase” of the war as Israel turns its focus toward the northern front against Hezbollah militants in Lebanon. Two waves of explosive attacks hit Syria and Lebanon: an apparent Israeli attack targeting pagers used by Hezbollah that killed at least 12 and wounded nearly 3,000 on Tuesday, and exploding walkie-talkies and other electronics Wednesday across Lebanon that killed at least 20 people and injured 450 others. “We are at the start of a new phase in the war — it requires courage, determination and perseverance,” Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told troops on Wednesday. The head of Hezbollah’s Executive Council promised the group would respond to Tuesday’s pager explosion attack with “special punishment.” Hezbollah began striking Israel almost immediately after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack that sparked the Israel-Hamas war. Since then, Israel and Hezbollah have exchanged fire daily, coming close to a full-blown war on several occasions and forcing tens of thousands on both sides of the border to evacuate their homes. Gaza’s Health Ministry says more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. The ministry does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count but says a little over half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Japanese wireless communication equipment-maker Icom says it cannot confirm whether a walkie-talkie used in the explosive attacks against Hezbollah was related to the company, noting that the production and sales of that device and its battery were discontinued about a decade ago. The Osaka-based Icom was responding Thursday to a report that said one of the walkie-talkies used in the attacks a day earlier had a sticker with the company’s logo. Icom also noted that the device in question did not have an anti-counterfeit hologram sticker, which all authentic Icom products should be carrying. Company executive Yoshiki Enomoto told Japanese television NTV he was “surprised” by the news. He said the company could not confirm if the unit in question was Icom-made. “This specific device had a lot of fake copies out in the market,” he said, adding that company officials could only determine its authenticity if they see its circuits. Icom said the wireless radio unit IC-V82 was once manufactured for export including to the Middle East from 2004 to October 2014. But the production and shipment of its main unit ended about 10 years ago and batteries for the main units have also been discontinued. The company said its export models are only distributed through official sales representatives under rigid export control rules set by the Japanese Trade Ministry. All Icom radio equipment is manufactured by its subsidiary, Wakayama Icom Inc., under strict security controls that only allow use of authorized parts. The products are only manufactured at the Wakayama plant in Japan, Icom said.

Lebanon blasts: Japanese firm says no longer makes devices reportedly used in Hezbollah explosions,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/lebanon-blasts-japanese-firm-says-no-longer-makes-devices-reportedly-used-in-hezbollah-explosions-12825205.html,World," September 19, 2024 / 12:22   ","Following fresh wave of blasts ripping through Lebanon on Wednesday afternoon after pager attacks, Japanese firm Icom said Thursday that it had stopped producing the model of walkie-talkies around 10 years ago. Issuing an official statement, Icom said, ""The IC-V82 is a handheld radio that was produced and exported, including to the Middle East, from 2004 to October 2014. It was discontinued about 10 years ago, and since then, it has not been shipped from our company."" ""The production of the batteries needed to operate the main unit has also been discontinued, and a hologram seal to distinguish counterfeit products was not attached, so it is not possible to confirm whether the product shipped from our company,"" it said. The company added that products for overseas markets are sold exclusively through its authorized distributors, and that its export programme is based on Japanese security trade control regulations. ""All of our radios are manufactured at our production subsidiary, Wakayama Icom Inc., in Wakayama Prefecture, under a strict management system... so no parts other than those specified by our company are used in a product. In addition, all of our radios are manufactured at the same factory, and we do not manufacture them overseas,"" the statement said. In the second wave of device explosions in as many days, 20 people died and more than 450 were wounded on Wednesday in Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon, officials said. A source close to Hezbollah said walkie-talkies used by its members blew up in its Beirut stronghold, with state media reporting similar blasts in south and east Lebanon. They came a day after the simultaneous explosion of hundreds of paging devices used by Hezbollah killed 12 people, including two children, and wounded up to 2,800 others across Lebanon, in an unprecedented attack blamed on Israel. There was no comment from Israel. The White House warned all sides against ""an escalation of any kind"". (With agency inputs) "
IIFL Finance faces downgrade risk on gold loan ban,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/iifl-finance-faces-downgrade-risk-on-gold-loan-ban-12825210.html,World," September 19, 2024 / 12:22   ","Indian shadow lender IIFL Finance Ltd is facing a threat of credit rating downgrade as early as this week, as a months-long regulatory ban on its gold loan business remains unresolved, according to people familiar with the matter. A local rating agency has informed the company about a possible rating change from AA to AA-, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the information is private. A potential downgrade may pressure the firm’s borrowing channels as funding costs could grow, and lenders could ask for early repayment from the beleaguered non-banking finance company which is already navigating a business contraction. IIFL fell under regulatory scrutiny in March amid a crackdown on financial firms, when it was asked by the central bank to stop disbursing new gold-backed lending following “material supervisory concerns”. Three local rating companies - ICRA Ltd, Crisil Ltd and Care Ratings Ltd - put it under rating watch with negative or developing implications following the ban. International credit assessor Fitch Ratings also put its B+ rating on negative watch. The company may let go of more than 9,000 employees in the gold loan business if the ban continues, said one of the people. Its employee number in gold loan branches already dropped from 15,000 in March to 12,000 in June, according to its financial reports. The assets under management in its gold loan business more than halved to 121.62 billion rupees ($1.5 billion) as of August 5 since the March ban. A spokesperson of IIFL Finance declined to comment.

"Europe, Africa, North Carolina Flooding: Once-in-a-lifetime floods are becoming routine",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/europe-africa-north-carolina-flooding-once-in-a-lifetime-floods-are-becoming-routine-12825129.html,World," September 19, 2024 / 12:13   ","Can a flood be called a thousand-year flood if it happens every five years? That’s a question worth asking this week in the southern US, central Europe and central Africa after the latest round of biblical deluges that are becoming increasingly routine and destructive as the planet heats up. They’re reminders that climate change is no longer a problem for our grandchildren — unless those grandchildren happen to be living in our flooded basements. Regardless of location or economic development, we are ill-prepared for the consequences. Earlier this week, a tropical storm so mediocre that it didn’t even merit a name hit the southern coast of North Carolina, around Wilmington, dumping 18 inches of rain in 12 hours. Meteorologists say this sort of event has a 1-in-1,000 chance of happening in any given year; something more commonly known as a “thousand-year flood.” But the moniker doesn’t quite fit when you consider similar disasters also hit the area in 1984, 1999, 2010, 2015 and 2018. Along with the latest flood, that’s five in just 25 years. Despite lacking a name, the rainstorm may have caused $7 billion in damage, private meteorological service AccuWeather estimated. Not counting that, there have been 20 extreme-weather events in the US so far this year wreaking $1 billion or more in damage, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, making it already the third-busiest year on record, with half of a hurricane season still to go.  Most of these disasters have basically been thunderstorms on steroids, causing damaging rain, hail and wind across a swath of the central US from Texas to Michigan. And they don’t include cheaper but still-catastrophic deluges in Florida, Vermont and elsewhere. The issue is that hot air is thirsty air, capable of soaking up water and then dumping it in torrential sheets when the conditions are right. The atmosphere can hold 7% more moisture for every 1 degree Celsius it warms. The planet has so far warmed about 1.3C above preindustrial averages on its way to 3C at our current pace of spewing greenhouse gases. These deluges are just a taste of what’s to come if we don’t quit fossil fuels more urgently. But they are more than destructive enough already. A swath of sub-Saharan Africa this month suffered the heaviest rainfall in its history, causing flooding that has taken 1,000 lives, driven millions from their homes and wreaked havoc on an already dangerously stretched food supply. It’s part of a bizarre weather pattern that’s even making it pour in the Sahara, with rain falling at a pace occurring “roughly once in several thousand years,” according to the weather blog Severe Weather Europe. The blog pointed to a 2023 study in the journal JG Atmospheres tying Saharan rainfall to heated water in the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. In other words, by heating up the oceans, climate change appears to be making it rain in the driest place on Earth. The unusually warm Mediterranean also helped fuel the rains inundating central Europe this week, in places dumping five Septembers’ worth of water in a few days. At least 20 lives have been lost and billions of dollars in damage incurred, and the floodwaters are still rising on the Danube River. Bloomberg News notes that Poland, the Czech Republic and other European countries have invested in flood defenses in recent decades, but they weren’t enough to avert disaster. These and other wealthy countries, including the US, will have to increase their drainage and reservoir systems to handle heavier downpours that are becoming increasingly routine. They’ll need to prioritize wetlands and floodplains over impermeable surfaces that don’t let water seep into underground aquifers. They’ll need to weatherproof homes, roads, bridges and other infrastructure. Developed nations must also help developing nations keep these rains from escalating from mere disasters to mass tragedies like the one unfolding in Africa. As noted by scientist Friederike Otto — a pioneer in attributing extreme weather to climate change — these catastrophes are amplified when they happen to already fragile societies. Rich nations have pledged $100 billion a year to help poorer ones mitigate and adapt to climate change. What’s really needed is more like $500 billion a year, according to the UN’s Standing Committee on Finance. Canceling or restructuring their staggering debt burdens would go a long way toward that goal. We’re looking at you, too, China. No matter where we are or whether we run a government or a household, we all need to question our own readiness for the next routine rainstorm that becomes a life-changing event. The climate crisis is not a thousand-year or even hundred-year problem. It has already started. Credit: Bloomberg  "
"Sri Lanka's presidential election test for current leader, 2 years after its economy hit bottom",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/sri-lankas-presidential-election-test-for-current-leader-2-years-after-its-economy-hit-bottom-12825161.html,World," September 19, 2024 / 11:37   ","Two years ago, food cart worker Fathima Shiyama had to wait in line, sometimes for days, to get cooking gas, fuel and other essentials. It was a test of patience for her and millions of other Sri Lankans as their country languished in economic and political chaos. Since then, under President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the South Asian island nation's economy has begun a fragile recovery. As the country gears up for a crucial presidential vote, key economic indicators have improved and there are no shortages of food and fuel. Inflation is almost under control after peaking at 70 per cent. Sri Lankans who usually vote along religious and ethnic lines will be keeping the state of the economy in mind when they vote Saturday on a new president. Many are still struggling, borrowing money or leaving the country to cope with rising living costs and limited opportunities. Shiyama says she isn't still earning enough to cover her monthly expenses and pay for her ailing daughter's medical tests. In desperation, she has turned to borrowing from loan sharks at an exorbitant 20 per cent interest rate. “We are trying our best to survive despite many difficulties,” said the 48-year-old mother of five, as she was selling “string hopper” noodles and coconut “pittu,” popular traditional dinner items, from a cart on the outskirts of Colombo. As Sri Lanka sank into economic collapse in 2022, a popular uprising led its then president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country. This weekend's election pits his successor, Wickremesinghe, against opposition leader Sajith Premadasa and Anura Dissanayake, leader of a Marxist-led coalition that has been gaining popularity. Poll results are due Sunday. All the candidates have promised to lead Sri Lanka into a prosperous future by developing new industries, improving agriculture, broadening the tax base to increase revenue and creating tens of thousands of new jobs. Under Wickremesinghe, Sri Lanka has been negotiating with the international creditors to restructure the country's staggering debt and get the economy back on track. The International Monetary Fund approved a four-year bailout programme last year, but many Sri Lankans are unhappy over the government's efforts to increase revenue by raising electricity rates and imposing heavy taxes on professionals and businesses, to meet IMF conditions for its assistance. Overall conditions have improved after the long dry spell during and after the pandemic. Vital tourism earnings have risen and the Sri Lankan rupee has recovered. But rising prices due to the government's austerity measures are squeezing many households. “We are in a very critical time” said Murtaza Jafferjee, an economic analyst and chairman of Advocata Institute, a Colombo-based independent policy think tank. ""The economy is looking up,” he said, but has not fully recovered. The government should aim for at least 4 per cent growth this year, instead of its target of 3 per cent. Politicians need to focus on policies that don't just benefit the country's elite, Jafferjee said. “It is high time that we run this country for the benefit of the 22 million people,” he said. Sri Lanka's economic crisis began well before the upheavals of 2022. Staggering economic mismanagement by successive governments was compounded by poor policy choices and then the pandemic. Rajapaksa pushed through big tax cuts in 2019. Then, he banned imports of chemical fertilizer to preserve Sri Lanka's scarce foreign reserves, hurting crop yields in a a country largely dependent on agriculture. With the war in Ukraine, food and fuel prices surged and fuel, cooking gas, medicine and food ran short. Sri Lankans lined up for government rice handouts and charity meals. Today, inflation has dropped below 5 per cent and there's no need to line up to buy essentials. But key parts of the economy remain in crisis. Jagath Dissanayake said conditions remain dire for his construction firm in Gampaha, a town located about 30 kilometres north of Colombo after prices of building materials tripled. Most of Dissanayake projects are suspended and he had to lay off two-thirds of his employees. “People have no money to do new construction as they give priority to buying essentials. We hardly get any new work,"" Dissanayake said. His income is down almost 75 per cent, he said, so there is no more dining out and Dissanayake rides a motorbike instead of driving a car, to save money on fuel. “Of course, there are no queues for petrol anymore, but we don't have enough money to buy it.” he said. Sri Lanka's construction industry has shed about 400,000 jobs in the last four years, according to some estimates. Once a booming industry that contributed nearly 12 per cent to the country's growth figures, its share has dropped to 7 per cent this year. Many Sri Lankans have sought jobs abroad. Viraj Maduranga, formerly a teacher in a government school, went to Dubai in 2021 to find work when he became unable to repay loans he had taken to build his house and buy a vehicle. “Either I had to sell off the house and the car, or find an alternative income. So, I decided to leave. It was not an easy decision for me and my wife, but we have to make sacrifices to build our lives,” said Maduranga, who now works as a teacher in Dubai and won't be able to vote in the election. Not everyone is impressed with the promises made by the candidates in this election. “We have seen it in the past, politicians saying various things, but when they come into power they have simply ignored what they have said during campaigns,” said W A Wijewardena, an economic analyst and former deputy governor of Sri Lanka's central bank. Jafferjee, the economic analyst, said the election is “extremely crucial” for Sri Lanka's economic recovery. The next president should use his executive powers to “enact pro-consumer policies"" and be more open to trade. “This (crisis) is not insurmountable, but you need to make unpopular choices. What you need basically is a president who looks to grow the pie,"" said Jafferjee. In the meantime, Sri Lankans like Maduranga are impatiently waiting for change. He longs to rejoin his wife and 8-year-old son in Sri Lanka, but still needs to repay his loans. “This is not the best time to go back,"" Maduranga said. “I want to live in Sri Lanka as a free man without being indebted to anyone.” (AP) GRS GRS

Diddy’s sex trafficking charges suggest a crime hiding in plain sight,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/diddys-sex-trafficking-charges-suggest-a-crime-hiding-in-plain-sight-12825043.html,World," September 19, 2024 / 09:32   ","Victims of sex trafficking, it is said, are often hiding in plain sight. I was reminded of that truism this week when Sean Combs, the music mogul also known as “Puff Daddy” and “Diddy,” was indicted for alleged conduct dating back to 2008. The offenses include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. According to the indictment, Combs forced women “to engage in frequent, days-long sexual activity with male commercial sex workers” in events “Combs referred to as ‘Freak Offs,’” which prosecutors described as “elaborate sex performances that Combs arranged, directed, and often electronically recorded.” The potential sentence for the charges ranges from a mandatory minimum of 15 years to life in prison. During a press conference on Tuesday, Manhattan US Attorney Damian Williams was asked why it took so long for law enforcement to intervene in the allegedly long-running scheme. Williams deflected the question, instead focusing on the current charges. But one reason that sex rings can endure for years is that bystanders fail to recognize what is occurring right before their eyes. The myopia is caused by common myths about sex trafficking. People imagine victims bound and gagged, in handcuffs and chains and held captive in a dungeon. Instead, the victims usually walk openly in public, side by side with their traffickers. Even when help is nearby, victims don’t run away. It can be difficult to explain to a jury why a victim would stay with someone who is forcing them to engage in commercial sex acts. In the cases I saw when I worked as a federal prosecutor, traffickers bait their prey with one or more tactics. They might provide lavish gifts, addictive drugs or promises of a glamorous career in modeling. The trafficker then uses those enticements as leverage against his victims. Nude photos created under the guise of creating a modeling portfolio are held over a victim’s head as potential revenge porn. Drugs are used to keep a victim, now addicted, dependent on the trafficker for another hit. Threats of physical harm and even beatings are used to coerce the victim into submission that may appear voluntary to onlookers who see the victim only in public. The indictment accuses Combs of engaging in precisely these kinds of acts against his victims — “obtaining and distributing narcotics to them, controlling their careers, leveraging his financial support and threatening to cut off the same, and using intimidation and violence.” The indictment also alleges that some of his employees — his private security team, household staff, and personal assistants — acted as intermediaries and concealed the abuse. I would expect to eventually see charges against these associates, perhaps after prosecutors explore whether they’ll cooperate in the prosecution of Combs. But what about witnesses who weren’t on his payroll? What about the airport personnel and catering staff who must have seen some of this activity? Or the hotel guests or employees who likely heard something when Combs kicked and dragged one of his victims in the hallway of the InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles, a crime caught on surveillance cameras and revealed by CNN? Most often, witnesses stay silent because they don’t realize what they are seeing. They may know that something is amiss, but write it off as a private argument. And when the offender is someone of wealth, fame and power, the reluctance to believe what they are seeing is even more pronounced. An indictment like this one can raise awareness of how sex trafficking really works, which, in turn, can help reduce this horrific crime. There are now training programs to help employees of gas stations and hotels recognize the signs of trafficking — the person appears fearful of their companion; has outward signs of injury, such as bruising; appears to have been denied sleep, food or medical care; or seems to be under the direction or control of another person, such as asking permission to use the bathroom. Signs in women’s restrooms provide resources for victims of sex trafficking. These efforts are worthy, but only a start. A case like the Combs indictment is not only an effort to bring an alleged offender to justice and to rescue his victims. It can also provide a teachable moment for the public. Not all victims of sex trafficking are in ropes and chains. Some are walking right before our eyes.

Hezbollah pager attack puts spotlight on Israel's cyber warfare Unit 8200,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/hezbollah-pager-attack-puts-spotlight-on-israels-cyber-warfare-unit-8200-12824863.html,World," September 19, 2024 / 11:14   ","The mass pager attack against Hezbollah in Lebanon has turned the spotlight on Israel's secretive Unit 8200, the Israel Defense Forces' intelligence unit, which a Western security source said was involved in planning the operation. Israeli officials have remained silent on the audacious intelligence operation that killed 12 people on Tuesday and wounded thousands of Hezbollah operatives. At least one person was killed on Wednesday when hand-held radios used by Hezbollah detonated. A senior Lebanese security source and another source told Reuters that Israel's Mossad spy agency was responsible for a sophisticated operation to plant a small quantity of explosives inside 5,000 pagers ordered by Hezbollah. One Western security source told Reuters that Unit 8200, a military unit that is not part of the spy agency, was involved in the development stage of the operation against Hezbollah which was over a year in the making. The source said Unit 8200 was involved in the technical side of testing how they could insert explosive material within the manufacturing process. The Israeli military declined to comment. The prime minister's office that has oversight of Mossad did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Yossi Kuperwasser, a former military intelligence official and now research director at the Israel Defense and SecurityÂ Forum, said there was no confirmation that the military intelligence unit was involved in the attack. But he said 8200's members were some of the best and brightest personnel in the Israeli military, serving in a unit at the centre of Israel's defence capabilities. ""The challenges they are facing are immense, very demanding, and we need the best people to get involved in that,"" he said. The unit â€“ and its legion of young, hand-picked soldiers â€“ develops and operates intelligence gathering tools and is often likened to the U.S. National Security Agency. In a rare public statement about the unit's activities, the IDF said in 2018 that it had helped to thwart an air attack by Islamic State on a Western country. At the time, it said the unit's operations ran from intelligence gathering and cyber defence to ""technological attacks and strikes."" While Israel has never confirmed its involvement, Unit 8200 was reported to have been involved in the Stuxnet attack that disabled Iranian nuclear centrifuges as well as a series of other high profile operations outside Israel. YOUNG RECRUITS The unit is effectively Israel's early warning system, and like much of the rest of the defence and security establishment, shouldered some of the blame for failing to detect Hamas' Oct. 7 assault on southern Israel. Its commander last week said he was stepping down. In his resignation letter carried by Israeli media he said he hadn't fulfilled his mission. The unit is famous for a work culture that emphasizes out-of-the-box thinking to tackle issues previously not encountered or imagined. This helped some graduates build Israel's high-tech sector and some of its biggest companies. ""Whether it's a problem with software weakness, math, encryption, a problem hacking into something â€¦ you must be capable to do it on your own,"" said Avi Shua, a graduate of 8200, who went on to co-found Orca Security, a cloud security unicorn. The unit has a high turnover rate of young recruits replacing veterans, said Kobi Samboursky, another former 8200 member and Managing Partner at Glilot Capital Partners, an early stage fund investing in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.

False reports of explosives found in a car near a Trump rally spread online,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/false-reports-of-explosives-found-in-a-car-near-a-trump-rally-spread-online-12824811.html,World," September 18, 2024 / 22:04   ","Law enforcement officials on Long Island worked quickly on Wednesday to publicly knock down social media posts falsely reporting that explosives had been found in a car near former President Donald Trump’s planned rally in New York. The false reports of an explosive began circulating hours before the Republican presidential nominee’s campaign event at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, just days after he was apparently the target of a second possible assassination attempt. Nassau County Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder said police questioned and detained a person who “may have been training a bomb detection dog,” near the site of the rally and “falsely reported explosives being found."" Lt. Scott Skrynecki, a spokesperson for the county police, said in follow-up messages that the person, who police have not yet identified, was a civilian and not a member of a law enforcement agency. He also said the person was not working at or affiliated with the event, which is expected to draw thousands of Trump supporters to the arena that was formerly the home of the NHL's New York Islanders. The rally is Trump's first on Long Island, a suburban area just east of New York City, since 2017. Earlier Wednesday, Skrynecki and other county officials responded swiftly to knock down the online claims, which appear to have started with a post from a reporter citing unnamed sources in the local police department. “False,” Skrynecki texted the AP as the claims spread on X, formerly Twitter. “No. Ridiculous. Zero validity,” said Christopher Boyle, spokesperson for Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman.

"Walkie-talkies explode across Lebanon day after deadly pager explosions, 9 killed",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/walkie-talkies-explode-across-lebanon-day-after-deadly-pager-explosions-report-12824830.html,World," September 18, 2024 / 22:56   ","A day after deadly pager explosions across Lebanon,Â  now reports are emerging that in a second wave of explosions across Lebanon hand-held radios used by Lebanon's Hezbollah detonated late on Wednesday afternoon across the country's south and in the southern suburbs of the capital Beirut, a security source and a witness said to news agency Reuters. Nine people were killed and more than 100 wounded in the latest attacks, the Lebanese authorities said, with the health ministry also describing the devices targeted as walkie-talkies. Meanwhile, Lebanon's state-run media said that the exploding devices killed nine people in the east on WednesdayÂ and more than 100 wounded in the latest attacks, the Lebanese authorities said, with the health ministry also describing the devices targeted as walkie-talkies, with similar blasts reported in other Hezbollah strongholds, according to news agency AFP. ""Three martyrs fell after devices exploded in the town of Sohmor,"" the state-run National News Agency said, with a hospital source in the city of Baalbek telling AFP 15 people had been wounded after walkie talkies exploded. Reuters reported thatÂ  at least one of the blasts took place near a funeral organized by Iran-backed Hezbollah for those killed the previous day when thousands of pagers used by the group exploded across the country. Hezbollah Â said on Wednesday it had attacked Israeli artillery positions with rockets in the first strike at its arch-foe since pager blasts wounded thousands of its members in Lebanon and raised the prospect of a wider Middle East war. Israel's spy agency Mossad, which has a long history of sophisticated operations on foreign soil, planted explosives inside pagers imported by Hezbollah months before Tuesday's detonations, a senior Lebanese security source and another source told Reuters. The death toll rose to 12, including two children, Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad said on Wednesday. Tuesday's attack wounded nearly 3,000 people, including many of the militant group's fighters and Iran's envoy to Beirut. A Taiwanese pager maker denied that it had produced the pager devices which exploded in an audacious attack that raised the prospect of a full-scale war between the Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel. Gold Apollo said the devices were made by under licence by a company called BAC, based in Hungary's capital Budapest. There was no immediate word on when Hezbollah had launched its latest rocket attack, but normally the group announces such strikes shortly after carrying them out, suggesting it fired at the Israeli artillery positions on Wednesday. Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate against Israel, whose military declined to comment on the blasts. The two sides have been engaged in cross-border warfare since the Gaza conflict erupted last October, fuelling fears of a wider Middle East conflict that could drag in the United States and Iran. Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi accused Israel of pushing the Middle East to the brink of a regional war by orchestrating a dangerous escalation on many fronts. ""Hezbollah wants to avoid an all-out war. It still wants to avoid one. But given the scale, the impact on families, on civilians, there will be pressure for a stronger response,"" said Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center. Hezbollah, Iran's most powerful proxy in the Middle East, said in a statement it would continue to support Hamas in Gaza and Israel should await a response to the pager ""massacre"" which left fighters and others bloodied, hospitalised or dead. One Hezbollah official said the detonation was the group's ""biggest security breach"" in its history. *With Agency Inputs

Google wins EU antitrust fine fight but setback for Qualcomm,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/google-wins-eu-antitrust-fine-fight-but-setback-for-qualcomm-12824817.html,World," September 18, 2024 / 19:37   ","Alphabet unitÂ GoogleÂ won a legal challenge on Wednesday against a 1.49 billion euro ($1.7 billion) European Union antitrust fine, while Qualcomm failed to repeal a penalty. The rulings underscore outgoing EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager's mixed record in defending her crackdown on Big Tech in court. She scored two major wins last week againstÂ GoogleÂ in a separate case and against Apple's tax deal with Irish authorities. The European Commission in its 2019 decision saidÂ GoogleÂ had abused its dominance to prevent websites from using brokers other than its AdSense platform that provided search adverts. The practices it said were illegal took place from 2006 to 2016. The Luxembourg-based General Court mostly agreed with the European Union competition enforcer's assessments of the case, but annulled the fine, saying that the Commission had failed to take into account all the relevant circumstances. ""The Commission has also not demonstrated that the clauses in question had, first, possibly deterred innovation, next, helpedÂ GoogleÂ to maintain and strengthen its dominant position on the national markets for online search advertising at issue and, last, that they had possibly harmed consumers,"" the judges said. GoogleÂ said the case was about a narrow subset of text-only search ads placed on a limited number of publishersâ€™ websites. ""We made changes to our contracts in 2016 to remove the relevant provisions, even before the Commission's decision. We are pleased that the court has recognised errors in the original decision and annulled the fine,"" the company said in an email. The Commission, which can appeal to the EU Court of Justice (CJEU) on points of law, said it would study the judgment and reflect on possible next steps. The AdSense fine, one of a trio of fines that have costÂ GoogleÂ a total of 8.25 billion euros, was triggered by a complaint from Microsoft in 2010. The company last week lost its final fight against a 2.42 billion euro fine levied for using its price comparison shopping service to gain an unfair advantage over smaller European rivals. In Qualcomm's case, the U.S. chipmaker only managed to convince the General Court to trim its EU antitrust fine to 238.7 million euros from 242 million euros. Judges threw out all its arguments. The Commission imposed the fine in 2019, saying that Qualcomm sold its chipsets below cost between 2009 and 2011, in a practice known as predatory pricing, to thwart British phone software maker Icera, which is now part of Nvidia Corp. The Commission said it had also taken note of that ruling. Qualcomm, which can appeal to the CJEU on points of law, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Traders lock in Fed bets as rate-cut size debate to finally end,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/traders-lock-in-fed-bets-as-rate-cut-size-debate-to-finally-end-12824796.html,World," September 18, 2024 / 18:56   ","Bond investors that have been frantically wagering on the size of the Federal Reserve’s first interest-rate cut in four years are about to find out whether they made the right trade. The market is fully pricing in a quarter-point rate reduction on Wednesday, when the US central bank is expected to kick off its rate-cutting cycle, with the chance of a bigger move viewed as a coin-flip. Treasuries have rallied into the decision, climbing for a fifth-straight month and driving short-dated yields — those most sensitive to Fed policy — to their lowest in two years. All that enthusiasm for cuts is creating a risk of sharp losses for traders if officials opt for a more modest 25-basis-point reduction after all. Despite facing the most uncertain scheduled Fed meeting since 2007, futures traders extended a record number of wagers riding on an outsized cut ahead of the Fed decision. “The Fed is going to have to strike some balance here,” said George Catrambone, head of fixed income at DWS Americas. “This is a market that is unbalanced with respect to the amount of rate cuts that they’re pricing in.” After coalescing around a smaller quarter-point cut in early September, traders boosted their bets for a half-point reduction after a report that Fed officials are split over taking a more aggressive policy path. Bill Dudley, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Bloomberg Opinion columnist, further added to the repricing, declaring that the Fed should cut 50 basis points, and that he expected it would. Still, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is one of the few Wall Street banks forecasting a large cut, and some commentators argue that the market has gone too far in pricing in rate reductions, both this week and heading into next year. “It is going to be a close call,” said John Brady, managing director at RJ O’Brien. “The key question is whether the Fed Chair has the full support of his committee for 50 bps of easing.” The pricing of more than 110 basis points of easing this year looks as if “markets may be getting a little bit ahead of themselves in terms of near-term cuts,” said Daniel Ivascyn, who runs the world’s largest actively managed fixed-income fund at Pacific Investment Management Co. He’s reducing some exposure to the “very front end of the yield curve” — notes due in one or two years — and instead favoring five-year maturities. Meanwhile, one of the world’s biggest asset managers Vanguard is buying the US dollar this week on the view that market bets on Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts are overdone. Beyond the cut itself, trading will be influenced by how central-bank officials outline the scope of total rate cuts over the next two years via their updated dot plot, as well as the tone of the press conference from Chair Jerome Powell. During the past two years, Treasuries have shown a tendency to rally after a Fed decision. For example, yields on the 10-year benchmark security have fallen on 17 of the past 20 decision days, dropping by an average of 7 basis points. Stocks have performed less consistently, with the S&P 500 Index rising half the time over the same period. The policy-sensitive two-year yield has tumbled from near 5% in late April and traded near 3.5% this week, a low from September 2022, as the clamor for rate cuts gained momentum against the backdrop of easing price pressures and signs of a softening labor market. Longer-dated Treasury yields are mostly trading below 4%. Beyond the Fed’s messaging this week, and also the US election in November, a weaker economy would ultimately vindicate the current rally in rates. “The Fed is data dependent and our view is that a soft landing is likely,” said Sinead Colton Grant, chief investment officer at BNY Wealth. “The 10-year yield could go as low as 3%, 3.25% from a couple of weak labor reports and further moderation of inflation.”

"Exploding phone, toxic spray: A timeline of covert Israeli hits",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/exploding-phone-toxic-spray-a-timeline-of-covert-israeli-hits-12824761.html,World," September 18, 2024 / 17:50   ","Lebanon has blamed Israel for the sabotage of thousands of pagers that caused them to explode, killing several people and wounding thousands, in an apparent bid to weaken the Islamist militant group Hezbollah. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the attack, which came after almost a year of cross-border rocket fire between the two sides in a second front to the war in Gaza. United Nations, government and tech-industry officials were left scratching their heads over how the co-ordinated series of blasts had been carried out, though veterans of Israel’s intelligence agencies Mossad and Shin Bet have opened up about assassinations in the past — some of which required high levels of technical or operational ingenuity. Deadly Phone CallShin Bet used a mobile phone secretly fitted with explosives to kill Yahya Ayyash, a master bombmaker from Hamas nicknamed “the Engineer,” in Gaza in 1996. A Palestinian go-between gave Ayyash the phone to receive a call from his father. When Israeli eavesdroppers verified it was Ayyash’s voice on the line, the phone was remotely detonated, causing a lethal head injury. Neck PoisonIn retaliation for a series of Hamas suicide bombings in 1997, then first-term Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the killing of the Palestinian Islamist group’s politburo chief, Khaled Mashaal, in the Jordanian capital of Amman. Two undercover Mossad officers sprayed poison onto Meshaal’s nape as he left his car for an appointment, with one of them opening a pre-shaken can of Coca-Cola to provide an innocent explanation for the rogue liquid. The plan failed because Meshaal’s daughter ran after him, prompting an aide to turn around and notice the would-be assassins. They were captured by Jordanian police, and repatriated only after Israel provided an antidote to save Meshaal’s life. Fake TouristsMahmoud al-Mabhouh, an international arms procurer for Hamas, was found dead in his Dubai hotel room in 2010. Emirati authorities initially deemed it death by natural causes, but re-opened the case after the Gaza-based Palestinian group accused Israel of killing him. The subsequent investigation uncovered CCTV footage of a Mossad hit team, using cloned European passports and posing as tennis-playing tourists, businesspeople or hotel staff, surveilling Mabhouh and converging on his hotel room. An autopsy determined that Mabhouh had been sedated and smothered. Traffic BlastsBetween 2010 and 2020, about half-a-dozen Iranian nuclear scientists were killed or wounded in gun attacks or explosions that authorities blamed on Israel. Most of them were caused by magnetized bombs that had been attached to vehicles by passing motorcyclists, according to Iranian state media reports. Israel hasn’t confirmed it was behind any of the strikes, though its officials acknowledged being locked in a shadow war with Iran. A former Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, would later claim responsibility for a similar assassination in the Iranian capital in 2022. Satellite SniperMohsen Fakhrizadeh, Iran’s chief nuclear scientist, was shot dead while driving in a convoy on the outskirts of Tehran in 2020. Some Iranian media reports said Israel used a satellite-controlled sniper rifle mounted on the back of a pick-up truck and equipped with AI face recognition. Israel didn’t confirm the killing, though Netanyahu had previously identified Fakhrizadeh as head of a secret Iranian nuclear weapons program, saying: “Remember his name.”

India to be third largest economy by 2030-31; grow 6.7% per annum: S&P Global,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/india-to-be-third-largest-economy-by-2030-31-grow-6-7-per-annum-sp-global-12825747.html,Economy," September 19, 2024 / 18:29   ","The Indian economy will grow 6.7 percent annually between now and 2030-31 or become the third largest economy in the world, S&P Global said on September 19. “India’s medium-term prospects are healthy and filled with opportunities in multiple sectors including trade, agriculture, and AI, likely structural reforms and growing energy demands. India is poised for growth, and with a young and dynamic workforce well-positioned to shape the global economic landscape,” said Abhishek Tomar, Head- S&P Global India Leadership Council. S&P Global forecasts the Indian economy to grow 6.8 percent in the current fiscal. The economy grew 6.7 percent in the first quarter, buoyed by steady manufacturing and rise in the services economy. In the first edition of its report titled “ India Forward: Emerging Perspectives”, the global research firm noted that continued reforms were necessary to boost private investment and reduce reliance on public capital. India’s capex surge has largely been driven by public capex, which is expected to grow in double digits in FY25 as well. The report noted that the country needed to develop infrastructure and geopolitical strategies to maximise trade benefits and urged it to look for sustainable energy alternatives to cater to its growing population. “Addressing the twin challenges of air pollution and climate change will help deliver a high-quality, high-growth economy to the world’s largest democracy,” the report noted. It also pointed out the need to leverage AI to boost growth prospects further. ""The equity markets are expected to stay dynamic and competitive due to strong growth prospects and better regulation. Foreign inflows into Indian government bonds have surged since the country joined major emerging market indexes, with further growth anticipated,"" S&P Global stated. The report noted further noted there's a need to contain risks rising from food inflation, which may keep consumption muted. “Equally important is the limiting of food inflation by addressing structural bottlenecks and climate risks, as well as fostering conditions for supportive monetary policy,” it said. India’s food inflation rose again in August, leading to overall inflation rising to 3.65 percent compared with 3.6 percent in the previous month.

Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | Takeaways from Jerome Powell’s bold 50 bps rate cut,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-pro-panorama-takeaways-from-jerome-powell-bold-50-bps-rate-cut-12825214.html,Economy," September 19, 2024 / 14:59   ","Dear Reader, The Panorama newsletter is sent to Moneycontrol Pro subscribers on market days. It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of.  Strangely, the US Federal Reserve’s larger-than-expected rate cut of 50 basis points (bps) does not seem to have put investors in a celebratory mood. On the contrary, US equities ended lower on Wednesday after an initial surge in benchmarks. At the time of writing, Asian indices portrayed mixed sentiments and Indian benchmarks were lacklustre. One reason could be the typical ‘sell on news’ phenomenon as the much-awaited cycle of lower interest rates is now a reality. But this is not all. The divergence between the outsized rate cut to ensure that inflation is kept in check while joblessness doesn’t tick higher also shows that there is some concern among the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members of growth rates slipping and slowing even if recession fears can be comfortably brushed aside. “We’re trying to achieve a situation where we restore price stability without the kind of painful increase in unemployment that has come sometimes with disinflation,” was Powell’s calibrated comment in the post-meeting press conference. Powell’s cautious stance suggests that while this big bang rate cut may be a one-off, the FOMC’s future decisions will hinge on data points rather than the dot-plot. For now, another 50 bps in calendar year 2024 is what economists concur on. In any case, given that some of the other central banks such as the European Central Bank had already started cutting rates and this week could see more decisions in this direction, it marks the end of the pandemic-era high interest rate woes. For emerging markets, specifically for India, the rate cut raises hopes of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) following the Fed, though perhaps not at its next meet. Market consensus points to a 25 bps rate cut by the RBI in December that would kickstart the 75-100 bps cuts over a year as it steers domestic inflation towards the targeted 4 per cent mark. MCPro’s edition today has a series of articles on the key takeaways for investors in financial markets. Foreign institutional investors (FII) fund flows will increase and there will be a surge of liquidity in Indian equity markets, says Anubhav Sahu in this article. Already, anticipating a rate cut, September 2024 FII net inflows were Rs 31,000 crore amounting to 42 percent of the FII net inflows in CY24. Veteran emerging market investor Mark Mobius, in an interview with CNBC International, said that in spite of high valuation concerns in the mid- and small-cap space, he is still upbeat on India. With FII flows, perhaps one could see a rotation out of mid- and small-cap stocks and into the large-cap favourites. That said, Indian equities which have outperformed S&P on a 5-year basis are also trading at price-to-earnings multiple that is ahead of the 15-year mean value. Meanwhile, expectations of rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve had already added to the bond market’s optimism along with the index inclusion earlier. But, while India’s bond investors love the Fed’s rate cuts, they must show a greater appreciation towards the RBI for keeping a steady exchange rate, says my colleague Aparna Iyer. Read why here. Another interesting read by Dinesh Unnikrishnan talks about the impact of the expected rate cut by RBI on the banking sector. It could see near-term stress on banks’ profit margins, but could augur well for asset quality. To sum up, the much awaited rate cut cycle is now real. How fast and in what doses the central banks across the world deliver to complete the task of reining in inflation while supporting economic growth, will drive financial markets.

Real Estate Investment Trusts or REITs are a sound vehicle to gain exposure to the real estate sector and various stakeholders, including the capital market regulator, have been pitching it in various forums. The recent past, however, has seen the regulator becoming a bit less vocal on the instrument for obvious reasons. While speaking at a capital market conference recently, SEBI chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch had jokingly said that if she talks about REITs then she will be accused of â€˜conflict of interestâ€™. So, it was a welcome change when recently a whole-time member of SEBI prodded the REITs industry to promote the instrument and even work on a catchy line â€“ likeÂ â€˜Mutual Funds Sahi Haiâ€™. Conflict or no conflict,Â REITs Bhi Sahi Hai!  An eye for the markets Dr Agarwalâ€™s Health Care Ltd, which is the holding company of the listed entity Dr Agarwal's Eye Hospital is set to file a draft document for an initial public offer (IPO) in the next couple of weeks. The Chennai-based entity has already appointed Kotak Mahindra Bank and Morgan Stanley as investment bankers for the planned issue. It had earlier raised over Rs 1,000 crore from TPG Growth and Temasek and the IPO will provide these two investors, among others, an exit opportunity. The two global investors collectively hold a majority stake of around 60 percent in Dr Agarwalâ€™s Health Care and have participated in two fund-raising rounds since May 2022. Auto makers look to strike a balance For many months now, auto makers have been facing the issue of huge inventory pile-ups and with the festive season fast approaching, the time has come to launch new models as well. Thatâ€™s a rough road for auto makers to drive on. Market insiders say that most of the auto manufacturers are looking to strike a balance by offering huge discounts on existing models and also cutting down on the roll outs in terms of overall supply. For example, if a company planned to roll out 1Â lakh units of a new launch, it would only do, say 60,000 or even less. Not the best of scenarios for car makers but one needs to look ahead while also keeping an eye on the rear-view mirror.

US Federal Reserve’s uncertain destination troubles the bond market,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/us-federal-reserves-uncertain-destination-troubles-the-bond-market-12825006.html,Economy," September 19, 2024 / 09:18   ","The Federal Reserve on Wednesday began its policy easing with a bang. Much of the focus was on its decision to cut interest rates by half a percentage point from a two-decade high. But the key question for the bond market is where rates will land once all is said and done. Nobody knows for sure, and Chair Jerome Powell injected enough uncertainty to ensure a choppy ride ahead. The Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections showed that the median respondent among Federal Reserve Board members and Federal Reserve Bank presidents now sees the “longer-run” federal funds rate landing at around 2.9%, up from about 2.8% in its previous quarterly update. That’s the rate that policymakers think will prevail in a balanced economy with a strong labour market and low and stable inflation. For years, policymakers thought that “neutral” was around 2.5% (or 0.5% in “real” terms, adjusting for inflation at 2%). Not only have their estimates drifted higher, but I suspect that they could climb a bit more to converge with the median private sector estimate of 3.1% in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s survey of primary dealers. My Bloomberg Opinion colleague Bill Dudley, the president of the New York Fed from 2009-2018, told me Wednesday that neutral is probably around 3% to 3.5% — and could be as high as 4%. The upshot is that longer-term bond yields don’t have much room to fall in the near-term unless the economy weakens materially. The developments help explain why yields on the 10-year Treasury note actually rose by five basis points after the Fed’s decision. In theory, “neutral” is believed to be a function of slow-moving factors including demographics and productivity, but it’s very hard to know what it is in real time. Estimates of the rate started to increase meaningfully in 2023, in large part because the economy didn’t react as expected to the Fed’s aggressive rate increases. The assumption was that if you could raise rates from near zero to 5.25%-5.5% and still have gross domestic product expanding at around 2.5% and an unemployment rate below 4%, perhaps policy wasn’t as “restrictive” as people previously thought. Of course, it’s also important to distinguish short-term factors from longer-run ones: At the time, millions of households were still reaping the benefits of excess savings and ultra-low pandemic-era mortgages. But those aren’t permanent features of the US economy, and, since then, the unemployment rate has climbed from 3.4% in early 2023 to 4.2%. In other words, it’s getting harder to argue that the rate hikes aren’t working at all. There’s still a decent argument for a higher neutral rate, but it’s a moving target. Powell acknowledged as much at his press conference, in response to a question from Christopher Rugaber of the Associated Press: There are model based approaches and empirically based approaches that estimate what the neutral rate will be at any given time. But realistically we know it by its works. He also gave this response to Fox Business journalist Edward Lawrence concerning the odds that policy rates would return to the near-zero levels seen after the financial crisis and during the Covid-19 pandemic (emphasis mine): Intuitively many, many people would say we’re probably not going back to that era where there were trillions of dollars of sovereign bonds trading at negative rates, long-term bonds trading at negative rates… and it looked like the neutral rate might even be negative… It seems that’s so far away now. My own sense is that we’re not going back to that. But you know honestly, we’re going to find out. But it feels to me that the neutral rate is probably significantly higher than it was back then. How high is it? I just don’t think we know. Again, we only know it by its works. All in all, there’s plenty worth celebrating in Wednesday’s Fed announcement. It’s a signal that the inflation dragon has been mostly slain. The size of the cut is a reminder that policymakers stand ready to support the labour market and head off any meaningful economic weakening. But over in the bond market, it sure looks like the party is just about over (at least for now). Members of the Fed’s rate-setting committee think that neutral interest rates are a bit higher than before, and that puts a floor under longer-term bond yields for the foreseeable future.

Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | TrafikSol IPO debacle puts the spotlight on SME listing scrutiny,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-pro-panorama-trafiksol-ipo-debacle-puts-the-spotlight-on-sme-listing-scrutiny-12824601.html,Economy," September 18, 2024 / 15:41   ","Dear Reader, The Panorama newsletter is sent to Moneycontrol Pro subscribers on market days. It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of.Â  In a rare and alarming turn of events, the listing of TrafikSol ITS Technologies was abruptly postponed, even after the company successfully raised funds through its IPO. TrafikSol's Rs 44.87 crore issue, oversubscribed by a staggering 318 times in the retail category, was halted at the last moment by the BSE. The exchange, citing concerns, delayed the listing and froze the use of the funds, which are now locked in an escrow account. The grey market premium of 135 percent disappeared overnight following this intervention. This incident underscores a larger issue within India's SME segmentâ€”funds are being raised without sufficient oversight. While SEBI regulates capital markets, the exchanges have been entrusted with the task of scrutinising companies listing on the SME platform. The onus falls on the exchanges, which are themselves in fierce competition to attract business. In this competitive landscape, it appears that proper vetting has taken a backseat. In TrafikSol's case, red flags were raised when the company sought investors' funds. Around 40 percent of the issue's proceedsâ€”Rs 17.7 croreâ€”were earmarked for the acquisition of software from a company called Oasis Corpcare. Oasis, a firm with a paltry equity capital of Rs 1 lakh and a focus on auditing and book-keeping, had failed to file its own financial reports since 2021. Such glaring issues only came to light after being flagged on social media, which forced the BSE to take last-minute action to halt the listing. This episode shines a harsh spotlight on the governance of SME IPOs. Companies looking to raise funds through the SME platform should at least pass the smell test. While it's true that the systems required for listing on the main board may be too stringent for smaller enterprises, a minimum level of due diligence is essential, particularly when it concerns the use of investor funds. Recognising these issues, SEBI is now considering tightening the norms for SME listings. However, this could be a double-edged sword. While better scrutiny is needed, overly strict regulations could dissuade smaller companies from using the SME platform altogether. For instance, the NSE recently introduced a rule requiring companies to show positive free cash flows for two out of the last three years. Such a stringent criterion may exclude many growth-oriented firms, particularly those still at the early stages of scaling up. Not many companies in the secondary market would meet this criterion. A growth company at its early stages typically needs to allocate all available funds towards scaling and executing its business plans. As a result, only a limited number of companies will meet the stringent criteria set by the exchange for listing, as such requirements often demand financial metrics that young, fast-growing firms may not yet achieve. There's no question that SME exchanges must better scrutinise the companies they list, but there's a delicate balance to strike. If regulations become too restrictive, they could undermine the very purpose of the SME platformâ€”providing smaller companies with a viable means to raise capital. Tighter norms would likely drive these companies towards private equity or alternative financing routes, further limiting their growth opportunities. The TrafikSol fiasco is a cautionary tale. It reveals the urgent need for a stronger regulatory framework that ensures basic governance standards are met while maintaining the flexibility necessary for smaller enterprises to thrive. In the end, the goal should be a balance between protecting investors and fostering a supportive environment for India's growing SME sector. If stricter regulations are imposed, companies may have to rely on private equity funds or other forms of private financing to meet their capital needs. This shift would exclude retail investors from the opportunity to invest in small, high-growth companies at an early stage, thereby limiting their access to potentially lucrative investment opportunities that could generate substantial returns.

GST legacy issues can undermine government’s efforts to ease tax structure,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/gst-legacy-issues-can-undermine-governments-efforts-to-ease-tax-structure-12824400.html,Economy," September 18, 2024 / 15:05   ","By Shivam Mehta and Tanya Garg Amidst the trend of decisions being taken in GST Council meetings, taxpayers have been staying hopeful and are banking heavily on the Council to alleviate hardships being faced by them. A couple of significant decisions taken in the previous Council meeting include reduction of GST rates on life saving cancer drugs from 12 percent to 5 percent and clarification that GST rates on services of transportation of passengers by helicopters will attract 5 percent tax. Relief in insurance sector is also on the cards since a Group of Ministers (GoM) has been constituted to look into the rate change. Even if the aforementioned decisions were truly in favour of taxpayers, some decisions have created another set of hassles and left them in a confused state such as GST rates on extruded products, car seats, exemption to foreign airlines etc. The GST rate on extruded/expanded savoury food products has been a subject matter of debate as the industry has been classifying them under CTH 2106 asÂ namkeenÂ and discharging 12 percent GST while tax authorities are of the view that these are classifiable under CTH 1905 attracting 18 percent GST, as indicated in the circular issued in 2023. ThoughÂ it has been recommended that such products, though classifiable under CTH 1905 will attract 12 percent GST prospectively, no relief, so far has been granted for the past period, leaving ongoing litigations unsettled. Moreover, if the industry takes a decision to discharge 12 percent GST prospectively under CTH 1905, the possibility of jeopardising the past litigations cannot be ruled out. Thus, is it important that this change is reviewed comprehensively and implemented carefully by tax payers. A seat is a seat? Another rate rationalisation attempt, which has left the taxpayers in a perplexed state is the GST rates on car seats being increased to 28 percent. The press release indicates that the said rate is being proposed to bring parity with seats of motorcycles which already attract GST rate of 28 percent. While GST rate of 28 percent on car seats may itself be a cost to the industry or taxpayers ultimately, the bigger concern is the comment made with respect to motorcycle seats stating that it already attracts 28 percent GST. The GST rate on motorcycle seats is already under litigation since most of players have been discharging 18 percent GST on it. Though the representations filed by industry seeking relief for the past was already on the table of the Council, issuance of the aforementioned clarification has aggravated the situation. Unless intervened by the Council or government in the form of clarification/exemption for the past, getting appropriate relief for motorcycle seats from courts may become an uphill task considering inconsistent clarifications issued with respect to this matter. Beware unintended consequences Similarly, the exemption granted to foreign airlines has, yet again, stirred up controversy for other industries, and has sparked doubts as to whether such exemption is warranted in similar cases (other than airlines) of import of services. Though the Council is gearing towards tackling the concerns of the taxpayers, careful decision making is highly warranted, in absence of which, the benefits meant for the taxpayers may turn into miseries. The recent clarifications also demonstrate that a thoughtful decision must be made by the taxpayers as to whether to approach the Council in an ongoing litigation or leave such matters to be decided by courts, offering relief and shaping jurisprudence. Moreover, it is the right time for GST council meetings to prioritize issues which are of national importance impacting consumer/public at large such as rate rationalisation, bringing ease in GST compliance etc. (Shivam Mehta is Executive Partner and Tanya Garg is Principal Associate at Lakshmikumaran & Sridharan, a law firm.)

ONOE represents a disruptive move when federalism is under stress,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/onoe-represents-a-disruptive-move-when-federalism-is-under-stress-12825410.html,Politics," September 19, 2024 / 14:13   ","Bringing about legal changes to hold simultaneous elections across all levels of government, or â€˜One Nation, One Electionâ€™ (ONOE), and creating a common centralised electoral roll were promises made in the BJP manifesto ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha election. In keeping with the same, the union cabinet on September 18 decided to go ahead with the preparatory work for it. The foundation for a transition to ONOE was laid before the Lok Sabha election when a nine-member committee led by former president Ram Nath Kovind presented a report in March 2024 recommending it. The report laid out its reasons and also said that legal changes synchronising Lok Sabha and state assembly elections do not require the union government to get concurrence of state assemblies. Synchronising local body elections, however, will need the concurrence at the level of state assemblies. We have been there before Between 1951 and 1967, India witnessed ONOE. Subsequently, when the electorate didnâ€™t always give a decisive mandate, some governments didnâ€™t last their full course and elections became asynchronous. This happened in the natural course of Indiaâ€™s democratic evolution. Therefore, the current drive to ONOE is to reset democracy by terminating the life of most state assemblies before they finish their natural course (this needs to happen once). Not all political parties were in favour of this disruptive step. The Kovind Committee report said 15 of the 47 political parties, or 32 percent, it consulted did not favour ONOE. A disruption of this scale where the entire cost of transitioning to ONOE has to be borne by states needs a powerful reason. Arguments in favour The strongest arguments in favour of ONOE in the Kovind Committee report are the benefits to the administrative system which provides the manpower for the election machinery. These benefits includes less disruption for staff and some level of cost compression. The weak link The most unconvincing aspect of the Kovind Committee report is the attempt to link economic growth outcomes to simultaneous elections. The report sidesteps the most important aspect of Indiaâ€™s economic track record. The economic growth spurt of the last 44 years came when we had asynchronous elections. The report appears to incorrectly conflate policy stability with elections. They are often unrelated. To illustrate, in the 1990s, India had five prime ministers, but economic policy across governments displayed a level of consistency that produced significant benefits later. Federal argument As a transition to ONOE has clear downsides for states, there has to be a more comprehensive assessment of costs and benefits than what the Kovind Committee attempted.Â  The Committee was necessarily limited in its assessment because it had a narrow remit. The high point of Indian federalism was the transition to GST in 2017, which represented the efforts of four union governments and a willingness on the part of states to voluntarily forego unilateral taxation powers for a larger cause. Since then, federalism has been under stress. One area where itâ€™s clearly evident is in the presentations opposition-administered states have been making to the 16thÂ Finance Commission. The Commission is in the midst of information gathering prior to preparing its report. Its report will be tabled at a time when some states feel they have been getting a raw deal in the allocation of resources. To illustrate, in a presentation to the Finance Commission in August, the Karnataka government asked for all cess and surcharge levied by the union government to be capped at 5 percent of the gross tax revenue (GTR). The background to this demand is that cess and surcharge are excluded from the divisible pool of tax resources shared among centre and states. Opposition-administered are vocal in their displeasure with a growing level of cess and surcharge that make up GTR as it reduces the fiscal space they get to fulfil promises made in their state election manifesto. The case against ONOE ONOE represent a disruption rather than a revolution. The NDA government on September 18 justified its decision on starting the transition to ONOE by citing the recommendations of the Kovind Committee. To justify this level of disruption, we need benefits that are far greater than what the Kovind Committee detailed. The Committee, limited by its remit, ignores the current political environment in India and the stress that Centre-State relations are under. The scale of political costs of transition will depend heavily on the harmony between the union government and opposition-administered states. The one thing that is absolutely clear is that we have long left the goodwill that was needed to roll out GST behind us. Thereâ€™s bitterness in the relationship. That makes the case for a transition to ONOE weak as we are underestimating the political costs. Itâ€™s best to drop this idea now. Instead, a reset of Centre-State relations should be the priority.

"Why India needs to implement ‘One Nation, One Election’ policy",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/why-india-needs-to-implement-one-nation-one-election-policy-12825411.html,Politics," September 19, 2024 / 14:16   ","The Narendra Modi government has passed a cabinet resolution to pursue the ‘One Nation, One Election’ policy. If implemented, it isn’t going to be something new for the Indian polity. Elections to the Lok Sabha and legislative assemblies of states were mostly held simultaneously from 1951-52 to 1967. Interestingly, some of the state assemblies were dissolved in 1957 by the Congress government at the Centre to hold simultaneous polls, and this was done with consensus among all the political parties. The states whose assemblies were dissolved prior to completion of their term to facilitate simultaneous elections for the Lok Sabha and all state assemblies included Bihar, Bombay, Madras, Mysore, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. According to the ECI’s report on the Second General elections in India (Volume I), “The Commission called a conference of the All-India Political Parties in New Delhi on the November 13, 1956, to elicit their views on the most convenient period in February-March, 1957, for holding the general elections. The representatives of the political parties expressed themselves unanimously that the poll should be held continuously without any long break.” The ECI report in 1962 also advocated for simultaneous polls in concurrence with all the political parties. The Law Commission of India in its 170th Report on ‘Reforms of the Electoral Laws’ submitted way back in 1999, observed that: “This cycle of elections every year, and in the out of season, should be put an end to. We must go back to the situation where the elections to Lok Sabha and all the Legislative Assemblies are held at once. It is true that we cannot conceive or provide for all the situations and eventualities that may arise whether on account of the use of Article 356 (which of course has come down substantially after the decision of the Supreme Court in S.R. Bommai vs Union of India) or for other reasons, yet the holding of a separate election to a Legislative Assembly should be an exception and not the rule. The rule ought to be ‘one election once in five years for Lok Sabha and all the Legislative Assemblies.”  The Law Commission reports in 2015 and 2018 also favoured simultaneous polls.  The annual Report of Election Commission of India in 1983 also advocated for ‘One Nation One Election Policy’. In September, 1982 the Commission recommended holding simultaneous elections to the House of the People and the Legislative Assemblies of States for the following weighty reasons: (1) Considerable saving on the colossal avoidable administrative and other expenditure incurred on account of holding of separate General elections (2) Substantial economy through revision of electoral rolls for the House of the People and the State Legislative Assemblies simultaneously instead of undertaking them on a countrywide basis twice over in two different operations. (3) For the conduct of elections, civilian personnel running into about twenty-five lakhs of officers and staff and a few lakhs of police personnel are deployed every time for about two to three months thereby seriously affecting their normal duties. (4) During elections whether for the Lok Sabha or the Assemblies, the entire administrative set up throughout the country slows down considerably and all other normal functions and activities of the Government, including developmental work, are pushed to the background. These create a lot of hardships and sufferings to the common man. The situation con (6) On account of the de-linking of the General elections to the House of the People from that of the State Legislative Assemblies, there is a duplication of the expenditure incurred by the candidates and political parties which results in the pumping in of considerable resources, thereby indirectly affecting money supply in the economy. Further by such de-linking, the candidates at Parliamentary election need more money and resources to fight the election singlehanded over a wide area without the backing and co-operation of companion candidates of the assembly segments. This also, it is suspected, tends to lead to difficulties for the candidates in keeping within the ceiling for election expenses. (7) The dismantling of the temporary but complicated superstructure raised for the purpose of election by accretion of huge personnel is required to be done as speedily and smoothly as of putting up the super-structure, and normal conditions should be restored quickly. In this respect also, simultaneous elections would be highly desirable.  The ECI report said, “Having regard to the above considerations, the Commission is strongly of the view that a stage has come for evolving a system by convention, if it is not possible or feasible to bring about a legislation, under which the General elections to the House of the People and Legislative Assemblies of the States are held simultaneously. After all, such an arrangement worked immensely satisfactorily, generally speaking, prior to 1967.  National Commission to review the working of the Constitution headed by former Chief Justice of India M. N. Venkatachaliah recommended in the first volume of its report in 2002, “With a view to reducing election costs and strain on human and other resources, State and Parliamentary level elections, to the extent possible be held at the same time.” It is clear that several constitutional bodies have always been in favour of restoring the ‘One Nation, One Election’ principle that was followed till 1967. The imposition of a model code of conduct during polls which are held at different times has a severe impact on the governance as governments aren’t allowed to take important policy decisions. The common people of India have been bearing the burden of elections around the year for too long. "
Reviving the Voices of History: Celebrating the unsung women of India's constituent assembly,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/reviving-the-voices-of-history-celebrating-the-unsung-women-of-indias-constituent-assembly-12824582.html,Politics," September 18, 2024 / 16:02   ","In the introduction to his book Incarnations: A History of India in 50 Lives, Sunil Khilnani writes, “India’s history is a curiously unpeopled place... it has dynasties, epochs, religions, and castes, but not many individuals. Beyond a few iconic names, most of the important historical figures recede into a haze.” The book aims to “dispelling some of the fog by telling India's story through fifty remarkable lives.” India’s constitutional journey started with the enactment of its Constitution in 1950. However, its trajectory was laid four years prior, when in December 1946, 299 members of the Constituent Assembly met for the first time in the Central Hall of the old Parliament House. Those seated in that Central Hall were stalwarts of their fields and the freedom movement. In that male-dominated assembly, 15 women stood tall. Sadly, their contributions did not receive the recognition they deserved. Just about 5 percent of the total membership, their voices could have easily gone unheard. However, they were women of high calibre and mettle. They made their voices heard, and their dissent was registered. But barring the few, stories of more than half of them did not get the due recognition in the pages of history. However, finally, their life stories have been retrieved from the “haze” and historical oblivion in a wonderful new book titled 'The Fifteen: The Lives and Times of the Women in India’s Constituent Assembly' authored by Angellica Aribam and Akash Satyawali. The authors make a pertinent point when they write, “Although the Constituent Assembly was meant to be a microcosm of India, certain sections of the population were not adequately represented. Only fifteen women were members of this distinguished body.” The fact that there were only 15 women members in the assembly (which came down to 13 after the resignations of Leela Roy and Malati Choudhury) speaks volumes about the male-dominated society. Even after 76 years of independence, when India held general elections in 2024, it chose merely 74 female members, which is only 15 percent of its total membership. Thus, the small number of women members in the assembly at that time is not surprising; rather, it is the historical indifference to recording their achievements that is more surprising. The book fills this large gap by providing short biographical accounts of these women leaders. The sketches are short and at times leave the readers wanting for more. Nevertheless, it provides a solid background of their politics, ideology, social context, philosophy and above all their struggles and their contribution to nation-building. The book is full of rich and interesting anecdotes related to the members which spice up the historical retelling of these extraordinary lives. For example, the name of Ammu Swaminathan might not ring a bell to the majority of readers initially. But it becomes familiar when it is revealed that she was the mother of Captain Lakshmi Sahgal, the iconic commander of Rani of Jhansi Regiment of Indian National Army (INA). Ammu’s struggle against caste discrimination and her fight for women's rights especially in the context of property rights is inspiring. At the same time, her “socialite” lifestyle and illustrious family tree that had Mrinalini Sarabhai as the daughter and Vikram Sarabhai as the son-in-law make it extremely fascinating. Similarly, the story of Annie Mascarene, a Latin Christian who had to struggle against the double odds of gender and caste-based discrimination is inspiring. Her struggle was further accentuated because of the financial constraints. However, through her grit and determination, she went on to do a double MA and later fetched a law degree. During the Constituent Assembly debate, she lent a powerful voice on important constitutional issues. The majority of women members came from relatively privileged backgrounds. From royalty to politically and socially influential families, the majority of these women had social conditioning that made them what they were—independent, educated, politically aware and socially assertive. But there were exceptions too and the most noteworthy among them was that of Dakshayini Velayudhan. Velayudhan belonged to the Pulya caste, marked as untouchables or ‘slave caste'. The extent of discrimination and injustice this caste faced can be gauged from the fact (as highlighted by the authors) that Pulya women were not allowed to wear upper clothes and their children were barred from the government school. Coming from such a background and then achieving excellence in education and becoming a prominent voice of the Dalit community and marginalised class, is a story that can inspire anyone. Other women who have been profiled in the book had illustrious careers. Rajkumari Amrit Kaur became India’s first health minister. Sarojini Naidu—a household name, became India’s first woman Governor. Sucheta Kripalani became India’s first woman Chief Minister of the most populous and politically significant state. Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit headed the delegation to the UN General Assembly session of 1946 and later became Ambassador to Russia. They all rose to prominence on their sheer hard work. They all contributed immensely and they have been widely celebrated. However, the life stories of some of the members like Kamla Chaudhuri, Malati Devi Choudhury and Durgabai Deshmukh have remained largely buried in government archives away from the mainstream. The book makes a serious attempt to unearth these stories and pave the way for further research which might result in detailed biographical accounts of these great personalities. As India prepares to celebrate its 75th year as the Republic, the contribution of these 15 women icons needs to be celebrated, and reading this book can be a good starting point.

Ram Nath Kovind panel report on simultaneous polls placed before Cabinet: Report,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/politics/ram-nath-kovind-panel-report-on-simultaneous-polls-placed-before-cabinet-sources-12824464.html,Politics," September 18, 2024 / 14:36   ","The report of the high-level committee on ’one nation, one election’ was placed before the Union Cabinet on Wednesday, sources said. The panel headed by former president Ram Nath Kovind had submitted the report in March ahead of the announcement of Lok Sabha elections. Placing the report before the Cabinet was a part of the law ministry’s 100-day agenda. The high-level committee had recommended simultaneous elections for the Lok Sabha and state Assemblies as the first step followed by synchronised local body polls within 100 days. The panel had also proposed setting up of an ’Implementation Group’ to look into the execution of the recommendations made by the committee. Simultaneous polls will help save resources, spur development and social cohesion, deepen ”foundations of democratic rubric” and help realise the aspirations of ”India, that is Bharat”, the panel had said. The panel also recommended the preparation of a common electoral roll and voter ID cards by the Election Commission of India (ECI) in consultation with state election authorities. At present, the ECI is responsible for the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls, while the local body polls for municipalities and panchayats are managed by state election commissions. The panel recommended as many as 18 constitutional amendments, most of which will not need ratification by state Assemblies. However, these would require certain Constitution amendment Bills that would need to be passed by Parliament. Some proposed changes regarding the single electoral roll and single voter ID card would need ratification by at least half of the states. Separately, the Law Commission is also likely to come up soon with its own report on simultaneous polls, of which Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been a strong votary. Sources said that the Law Commission is likely to recommend holding simultaneous polls for all three tiers of the government — the Lok Sabha, state Assemblies and local bodies like municipalities and panchayats — starting with 2029 and a provision for unity government in cases like hung house.

India must address Bangladesh’s challenges directly amid diplomatic tensions,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/india-must-address-bangladeshs-challenges-directly-amid-diplomatic-tensions-12824206.html,Politics," September 19, 2024 / 15:53   ","Trains between Bangladesh and India have stopped running. There are three pairs of cross-border trains, but none are currently operating. Additionally, New Delhi has indefinitely shut down all Indian visa application centers (IVACs) across Bangladesh, effectively cutting off all people-to-people contact. Dangerous Diplomatic Silence But the biggest giveaway of the dangerous slide in India-Bangladesh relations is the radio silence after Bangladesh’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus sent a formal request for a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the United States on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly. Both leaders are scheduled to travel to New York this week, but Modi is clearly hesitant to meet Yunus, as the latter is likely to raise contentious issues such as the extradition of fugitive ex-premier Sheikh Hasina. There are currently no indications that New Delhi will address Dhaka’s valid request for Yunus’ engagement with Modi. It would be beneficial for India to sit down with Yunus and clear the air to establish at least a functional relationship between the two countries. Need for Comprehensive Engagement I think India should shed its reluctance and meet ‘Bangladesh 2.0’ self-assuredly without any inhibitions to thrash out issues thrown up by the sudden regime change. Let’s start by acknowledging that there are indeed bilateral problems. And the right approach for a resident power is to confront them instead of avoiding discussing difficult issues. We have, no doubt, suffered a setback and we must sensibly accept the profound changes and new ground realities. But we should keep our chin up and talk rather than withdraw into our shell. New Delhi’s inability to confirm a Modi-Yunus tete a tete in the Big Apple is of a piece with our High Commissioner in Dhaka Pranay Verma’s reticence to meet political players across the board in Bangladesh. He did call on Yunus soon after the 84-year-old Nobel Laureate took his turbulent country’s reins in his hands. But Verma has so far shied away from meeting the leadership of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, Jamaat-e-Islami Party, Workers Party and Jatiya Party, not to mention the Awami League which is on the run, and other smaller outfits. Ultimately, elections will be held and all these players, particularly the BNP and Jamaat, will be in the race to form the next government in Bangladesh. So it’s imperative to hold dialogues with each one of them instead of keeping them at arm’s length. No Bangladeshi politician will say “no” to Verma if he sounds them out for a meeting. I fail to understand what’s stopping him from talking to them. He had no problems interacting regularly with Hasina; the dapper diplomat must now diversify and play the field in our national interest. To Verma’s credit, it must be said that while inexplicably abstaining from courting politicians of various hues, he is however interacting proactively with key Advisors in charge of various departments in the interim administration. He recently held sessions with ex-Foreign Secretary Muhammad Touhid Hossain, Foreign Affairs Advisor, retired Lieutenant General Alam Chaudhury, Home Affairs Advisor, Fauzul Kabir Khan, Energy Affairs Advisor, Salehuddin Ahmed, Economic Affairs Advisor and Fisheries Advisor Farida Akhtar. Unresolved Issues But this is simply not enough as Advisors are, after all, birds of passage and are no substitute for hard-core politicians who will inevitably occupy key posts in the elected government sooner than later. New Delhi should therefore start engaging with all the players in the political spectrum without losing any more time. As Chinese, Pakistani and British diplomats have stolen a march on us in this sphere, we have a lot of catching up to do. So, let’s get cracking. At this critical juncture, India must come to terms sportingly with what Bangladeshis want rather than try to impose our code of conduct on the smaller nation. Let Bangladesh run its own affairs and decide what’s good for it. If Bangladeshis want to proclaim Mohammad Ali Jinnah instead of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as the nation’s father, it’s really their business, not ours. If Urdu stages a comeback in Bangladesh, so be it. Gone are the days of micromanaging Bangladesh. We can’t be Big Brother anymore; at best we can be an elder brother! Managing Bilateral Relations If good sense prevails and India agrees to a Modi-Yunus meeting on American soil, Yunus is bound to raise not only the uncomfortable issue of sending Hasina back to Bangladesh to face trial, but also the alleged irregularities in the deal that the Hasina government signed with the Adani Group for supplying electricity. As South Asia’s tallest leader and India’s foremost spokesperson, Modi should address these concerns immediately and put Bangladesh at ease. Because of the vicious disinformation campaign over treatment of Hindus in Bangladesh, there is every likelihood of the Bangladesh cricket team visiting India from September 19 being subjected to hostilities from the crowd in the stadiums. Authorities in India must therefore ensure that there are no Islamophobic chants aimed at the visitors as political agendas would ultimately hurt our national interests.

However, it could not sustain all of those gains due to profit booking, ending with a 38-point gain at 25,416 on September 19. The index failed to sustain above the upward-sloping resistance trendline, which is crucial for a further upward move towards 25,600. Until then, it may consolidate with support at 25,300, according to experts. Below are 15 data points we have collated to help you spot profitable trades:  Here are 15 data points we have collated to help you spot profitable trades: 1) Key Levels For The Nifty 50 Resistance based on pivot points: 25,558, 25,614, and 25,704 Support based on pivot points: 25,378, 25,322, and 25,232 Special Formation: The Nifty 50 formed a bearish candlestick pattern with a long upper shadow on the daily charts, indicating profit booking at higher levels. However, it remained above all key moving averages, with a positive bias in momentum indicators such as the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence). 2) Key Levels For The Bank Nifty Resistance based on pivot points: 53,273, 53,392, and 53,585 Support based on pivot points: 52,887, 52,767, and 52,574 Resistance based on Fibonacci retracement: 53,362, 54,368 Support based on Fibonacci retracement: 52,491, 51,949 Special Formation: The Bank Nifty continued to outperform the benchmark Nifty 50, hitting a fresh record high by rising 287 points to close at 53,038. The index formed a bullish candlestick pattern with a long upper shadow on the daily charts, resembling a Shooting Star pattern at the high (which is a bearish reversal pattern), signalling some profit booking at the peak. The index continued its higher highs-higher lows formation for the sixth consecutive session.  3) Nifty Call Options Data According to the weekly options data, the 25,400 strike holds the maximum open interest (with 2.41 crore contracts). This level can act as a key level for the Nifty in the short term. It was followed by the 25,500 strike (1.38 crore contracts) and the 26,000 strike (1.1 crore contracts). Maximum Call writing was observed at the 25,400 strike, which saw an addition of 1.84 crore contracts, followed by the 25,500 and 25,800 strikes, which added 69.14 lakh and 39.97 lakh contracts, respectively. The maximum unwinding was seen at the 25,300 strike, which shed 10.42 lakh contracts, followed by the 26,500 and 25,200 strikes, which shed 9.97 lakh and 4.37 lakh contracts, respectively.  4) Nifty Put Options Data On the Put side, the maximum open interest was seen at the 25,400 strike (with 2.09 crore contracts), which can act as a key level for the Nifty. It was followed by the 25,000 strike (90.77 lakh contracts) and the 25,500 strike (71.81 lakh contracts).

The increasing PCR, or being higher than 0.7 or surpassing 1, means traders are selling more Put options than Call options, which generally indicates the firming up of a bullish sentiment in the market. If the ratio falls below 0.7 or moves towards 0.5, then it indicates selling in Calls is higher than selling in Puts, reflecting a bearish mood in the market.  9) India VIX Volatility dropped sharply after the end of uncertainty related to the Federal Reserve event, providing more comfort to the bulls. The India VIX, the fear index, fell by 6.75 percent to 12.47, down from 13.37 levels.  10) Long Build-up (54 Stocks) A long build-up was seen in 54 stocks. An increase in open interest (OI) and price indicates a build-up of long positions.  11) Long Unwinding (29 Stocks) 29 stocks saw a decline in open interest (OI) along with a fall in price, indicating long unwinding.  12) Short Build-up (63 Stocks) 63 stocks saw an increase in OI along with a fall in price, indicating a build-up of short positions.  13) Short-Covering (39 Stocks) 39 stocks saw short-covering, meaning a decrease in OI, along with a price increase.  14) High Delivery Trades Here are the stocks that saw a high share of delivery trades.

"Sebi's action on Axis Capital: Research Analyst's article tipped off the regulator about ""high-risk transaction""",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebis-action-on-axis-capital-research-analysts-article-tipped-off-the-regulator-about-high-risk-transaction-12825839.html,Market," September 19, 2024 / 21:04   ","A registered research analyst's article had flagged the irregularity in Axis Capital's (ACL's) handling of a non-convertible debenture issue to the market regulator. It was an article by Hemindra Kishen Hazari, titled ""Is Axis Capital an Investment Bank or a Hedge Fund"" and dated January 16, 2024, that brought the regulator's attention to the NCD issue. On September 19, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) passed an interim order restraining ACL from taking any new assignments in the capacity of a merchant banker, arranger or underwriter for any issue or offer for sale of securities in the debt segment until further orders. Also read: Sebi bars Axis Capital from acting as investment banker in debt market until further orders The order passed by Sebi's Whole-time Member (WTM) Ashwani Bhatia stated that Hazari's article highlighted certain concerns regarding a high-risk transaction undertaken by ACL, a Sebi-registered merchant banker and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Axis Bank. Following the reading of this article, the regulator's officials conducted an inspection of ACL. The inspection examined whether the transaction undertaken by ACL in respect of listed Non-Convertible Debentures (“NCDs”) of Sojo Infotel Pvt. Ltd. The regulator passed an interim order stating that ACL provided guarantee for the NCD issue in the guise of underwriting, which is not permitted under the existing regulatory framework. The regulator even found such an arrangement posing a risk to the financial system as ""it can potentially disrupt the orderly functioning of the market"". Hazari, according to his webpage, is a commentator with over 25 years of experience in the Indian capital markets. He has specialised in research on banking and the macro-economy. The page added, ""He has managerial experience of establishing profitable equities business, leading and mentoring analysts."" What was the arrangement ACL came to?For the NCD issue, a debenture trustee deed (DTD) was executed between Sojo, Axis Debenture Trustee (ADT) and ACL. Sojo had pledged the shares of LIL as security cover for the NCD issue. Under the DTD, if there a default, the debenture trustee would invoke a pledge. Then, according to the DTD, if ACL is not able to find buyers for the pledged shares, it would have to fulfil its ""underwriting commitment"", by having to purchase or fund the purchase of these pledged shares. As the order noted, ""ACL was unconditionally, unequivocally and irrevocablyobligated to purchase or fund the purchase of the Pledged Shares."" The order stated, ""The commitment provided by ACL in respect of NCDs of Sojo cannot be termed as an underwriting activity as it was not an agreement to “subscribe to or procure subscription for securities, issued or offered for sale, remaining unsubscribed.” Rather, it was a guarantee to redeem the NCDs of Sojo in the event of default on maturity."" The order noted that, with this arrangement, ACL went beyond the mandate of issue management and its activity was in contravention of the definition of underwriting and the role of Merchant Banker as defined in MB Regulations, 1992.

In an interim order issued on September 19, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has also asked ACL to reply within 21 days to the observations made in the order. The regulator looked into the allegation that ACL extended itself beyond activities permitted to a merchant banker in the issue of listed non-convertible debentures (NCDs) of Sojo Infotel. According to the interim order passed by Sebi's Whole-time Member (WTM) Ashwani Bhatia, ""ACL provided guarantee/indemnity towards redemption of NCDs in the guise of underwriting, which it was not permitted to do under the existing regulatory framework. Such activity poses risk to the financial system as it can potentially disrupt the orderly functioning of the market."" Also read: Sebi aims to empower REIT investors with the launch of Data Benchmarking Institutions A merchant banker is allowed to take market risk while underwriting an issue. That is, it is allowed to subscribe or procure subscription for securities, issued or offered for sale, that remain unsubscribed. As the order states, ""Very clearly, the intent of the Regulations is to permit a Merchant Banker to take market risk by subscribing to the unsubscribed portion of the securities offered to the investors and to dispose of the securities so procured, by charging a fee."" But, through its arrangement with Sojo, ACL was undertaking a credit risk by providing credit-risk cover to the NCD subscribers, according to the order. According to the order, ACL's transaction with regard to Sojo's NCDs was not part of issue management but of security enforcement mechanism, which essentially falls under the domain of debenture trustee (which in this case was Axis DT or ACL's sister concern). As the order said, ""The whole transaction was, in substance, a structured secured credit transaction in the cloak of a capital market instrument (bonds) designed to finance an acquisition (of Lava International Ltd or LIL), which had adequate collateral / guarantees in the form of pledge of shares of Sojo and LIL, personal guarantees of promoters of Sojo, lien over escrow account and hypothecation of assets of Sojo. ACL’s credit support or credit enhancement, which was a credit guarantee in the guise of underwriting, was a critical component of the said structured credit transaction. ACL in this case was taking credit risk exposure, rather than market risk."" How did this work? For the NCD issue, a debenture trustee deed (DTD) was executed between Sojo, Axis Debenture Trustee (ADT) and ACL. Sojo had pledged the shares of LIL as security cover for the NCD issue. Under the DTD, if there a default, the debenture trustee would invoke a pledge. Then, according to the DTD, if ACL is not able to find buyers for the pledged shares, it would have to fulfil its ""underwriting commitment"", by having to purchase or fund the purchase of these pledged shares. As the order noted, ""ACL was unconditionally, unequivocally and irrevocablyobligated to purchase or fund the purchase of the Pledged Shares."" The order stated, "" The commitment provided by ACL in respect of NCDs of Sojo cannot be termed as an underwriting activity as it was not an agreement to “subscribe to or procure subscription for securities, issued or offered for sale, remaining unsubscribed.” Rather, it was a guarantee to redeem the NCDs of Sojo in the event of default on maturity. It is pertinent was noted that the CRAs (CRISIL / ICRA) had rated and assigned CE ratings to all of the above mentioned issuances on the basis of the guarantee/indemnity provided by ACL which was legally enforceable, irrevocable and unconditional covering the entire amount and full tenure of the rated instrument."" The order taking these and various other facts into consideration stated that "" in the instant case, ACL went beyond the mandate of issue management, as the activity undertaken by ACL was in contravention of the definition of underwriting and the role of Merchant Banker as defined in MB Regulations, 1992.

The reason for the litigation is differences over an agreement signed in August 2020 for the supply of high calorific coal for Tata Power's Trombay plant, leading to both parties issuing notices. Adaro's notice alleged a breach and sought arbitration with a claim of $106 million, which was countered by Tata Power's counter claim of $229.947 million for non-supply of coal. ""During the performance of the agreement, differences arose between both the parties. Adaro issued a notice alleging breach by TPCL, which was followed by the request for arbitration with an alleged claim of USD 106 million. To this, TPCL responded and raised counter claims of USD 229.947 million for non-supply under the agreement."" Tata Power said both parties are in 'serious discussions to amicably resolve the dispute', however, they have also agreed to proceed with the arbitration at the International Chambers of Commerce International Court of Arbitration (ICC ICA). The Arbitration is currently in nascent stages and the constitution of the arbitral tribunal is yet to take place i.e. party nominated arbitrators are yet to be confirmed by ICC ICA andonly after such confirmation, the process for appointment of presiding arbitrator will be initiated.

The quarterly “triple-witching” will see some $5.1 trillion worth of options tied to individual stocks, indexes and exchange-traded funds fall off the board, according to an estimate from derivatives analytical firm Asym 500. While the risk is sometimes overblown by Wall Street players, the options event has a reputation for causing sudden price moves as contracts disappear and traders roll over their existing positions or start new ones. This quarter’s expiration comes at a crucial juncture for market positioning following the Fed’s decision on Wednesday to cut interest rates for the first time since the depth of the pandemic. While the S&P 500 Index is less than 1% from its record, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX — which gauges expected swings in the S&P 500 — is holding above levels from before the market slumped in late July and early August, suggesting investors are still somewhat cautious. “Triple-witching will likely inject more volatility into the market — we just don’t know which direction,” said Matt Thompson, co-portfolio manager at Little Harbor Advisors. “Whatever the market’s opinion is about the Fed cutting rates will be exacerbated by a large options expiration on Friday.” Once again, the options expiry coincides with the rebalancing of benchmark indexes including the S&P 500, suggesting a bevy of investors will actively trade around those positions, with single-day volumes typically ranking among the highest of the year. Before the market opens on Monday, Dell Technologies Inc., Erie Indemnity Co. and Palantir Technologies Inc. will replace Etsy Inc., Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc. and American Airlines Group Inc. in the S&P 500. The bulk of open interest for both puts and calls is concentrated around the S&P 500’s 5,500 level, according to Tanvir Sandhu, chief global derivatives strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. The index has largely stayed within 200 points of the threshold in recent weeks, fueling speculation that the tight trading range was a function of options activity that made it a battle line for investors and market makers. Weak seasonality has also played a role in the past, with triple witching in September typically being followed by an equity swoon the ensuing week. Since 1990, the S&P 500 has slumped 1.1% on average the week after September options expiration, according to the Stock Trader’s Almanac. There have only been four exceptions where stocks saw across the board gains in that stretch: 1998, 2001, 2010 and 2016. That said, the size of options positions expiring is 4-to-1 in favor of call versus put positions, which helped stocks deliver their best five-day stretch of the year last week, according to Brent Kochuba, founder of options platform SpotGamma. Given that Nvidia Corp. is trading with a high amount of calls relative to the rest of the market, that should serve as a “catalyst for further equity upside,” he said. “The recent stock rally reduced large put positions, which relieved downside hedging pressure into the FOMC meeting and VIX expiration,” Kochuba said. “This reduced hedging pressure allows for more potential volatility over the next week.” That’s why traders are monitoring Wall Street dealers on the other side of options transactions, who buy and sell stocks to maintain a market-neutral stance. These dealers are “short gamma,” if the S&P 500 slides below 5,600, according to Kochuba, and in order to remain neutral will have to start selling stock below that level. Now, as many contracts expire, the crucial question is whether investors will rebuild their holdings of protective puts on economic growth concerns — or will they chase this month’s market rebound, buying call contracts with the S&P 500 hovering near a record. “If the Fed’s rate cut is interpreted as too little too late, protective puts may be bought, which could then drag the market lower if dealers are forced to hedge,” said Thompson of Little Harbor Advisors. “But if cuts are received well...that would support stocks.”

In the Large cap category, Motilal Oswal Large Cap Fund-Regular (G) posted a monthly return of 3.14 per cent with an asset under management (AUM) of Rs 1,076.70 crore. Bandhan Large Cap Fund-Regular (G) showed a gain of 2.89 per cent. In Large and Midcap category, Motilal Oswal Large & Midcap Fund-Regular (G) posted a return of 4.59 per cent. Motilal Oswal Multi Cap Fund-Regular (G) delivered the highest return of 6.64 per cent in the Multi Cap category.

According to AMFI's monthly data, in August, open-ended equity mutual fund inflows reached Rs 38,239.16 crore, a gain of 3  per cent, and net AUM stood at Rs 66.70 lakh crore. Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) contributions for the month also grew to Rs 23,547 crore against July's Rs 23,331 crore. SIP AUM reached Rs 13.39 lakh crore. The total number of SIP accounts increased to 9.61 crore in August, as compared to 9.34 crore  in July. Also read: Five highlights for equity markets from AMFI's latest data Benchmark outperformance  In July, 39 per cent of the funds outperformed their benchmarks. The report noted that large and mid-cap funds performed the best. Around 79 per cent of the schemes outperformed the benchmark (Nifty Large Midcap 250-TRI). The second-best performance came from focused funds, which outperformed their respective benchmark (Nifty 500-TRI) by 75 per cent. Multi-cap, mid-cap and flexi-cap funds outperformed their respective benchmark by 69 per cent each. On the contrary, large cap funds were the least performing fund category. Data shows 55 per cent of these funds outperformed the benchmark. Pankaj Shrestha, Head of Investment Services, PL Capital,  said, there were strong inflows into large, mid-cap, and multi-cap categories due to their performance. ""Flexi-cap funds, which have up to 65 per cent exposure in large-cap stocks, have not performed well. In contrast, large, mid-cap and multi-cap funds, with flexible allocations, offer higher outperformance potential,"" he added. Shrestha noted that large-cap funds are struggling to beat benchmarks, driving investors towards index funds. He cited that small-cap and multi-cap categories, with broader allocation, are better for generating alpha (Alpha refers to excess returns earned on an investment above the benchmark return when adjusted for risk). Multi-cap funds allocate at least 25 per cent to large, mid, and small-cap stocks. ""In hybrid equity funds, there's been a renewed interest, especially after the Union budget in July, which raised taxes on equity gains and narrowed the gap between equity and debt investments,"" Shrestha added. What's next? Shrestha exuded confidence about the US Fed rate cut as a positive for the Indian capital market. “Lower interest rates are expected to reduce costs for consumers and corporations. The move will boost overall spending and corporate profitability, leading to improved stock performance and mutual fund returns,” he said. He also highlighted the strong liquidity in the market. “Net monthly inflows into equity funds have exceeded Rs 34,000 crore for the past four months. Investors are increasingly comfortable with new categories of funds like multi-cap and large and mid-cap, which are expected to perform better in the future due to their flexibility, as compared to more restrictive categories like large-cap funds,” he added.

"HDFC Bank to close Rs 9,000-cr loan sale this month, says report",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/hdfc-bank-to-close-rs-9000-cr-loan-sale-this-month-says-report-12825563.html,Market," September 19, 2024 / 16:02   ","India's largest private lender HDFC Bank hopes to complete a planned sale of loans worth more than Rs 9,000 crore ($1.08 billion) â€“ its largest to date â€“ by the end of September, three sources aware of the matter said on Thursday. The sources requested anonymity as they are not authorised to speak to media. HDFC Bank did not immediately reply to a Reuters query. HDFC Bank merged with parent Housing Development Finance Corp in July 2023, adding a large pool of mortgage loans to the bank's portfolio but a much smaller amount of deposits. This has put it under pressure to increase the pace at which it raises deposits or to slow loan growth. The bank is in the process of issuing pass through certificates that are backed by a pool of car loans. India Ratings has assigned a provisional AAA(SO) rating to these instruments and said the collateral pool had an outstanding of Rs 9,062 crore as on August 31. The provisional ratings are based on the origination, servicing, collection and recovery capabilities of HDFC Bank, the rating agency said. ""The bank has already tied up with investors that include mutual funds, some corporates as well as some non-banking finance companies who would be subscribing to these instruments,"" one of the sources said. The pass through certificates, divided in three parts, will mature in September 2026, July 2027 and September 2030, and will have loans worth Rs 3,500 crore, Rs 1,800 crore and Rs 3,762 crore, respectively.

India needs to develop content-tracking system for Gen AI: Report,https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/india-needs-to-develop-content-tracking-system-for-gen-ai-report-article-12825517.html,Market," September 19, 2024 / 15:46   ","India needs to develop a content tracking system for generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) technologies at a time when concerns are being raised on the source and authenticity of digital content, an EY-FICCI report has said. ""As AI evolves, it becomes increasingly challenging to differentiate between human-created and machine-generated content, leading to potential issues such as misinformation, copyright infringement, and a loss of credibility in digital content,"" a release said. The report â€” Identifying AI Generated Content in the Digital Age: The Role of Watermarking â€” addresses the need to distinguish AI-generated content from human-generated material. It highlights the importance of enabling consumers to identify AI-generated content, ensuring informed decision-making. AI content detection tools are essential for establishing authenticity and maintaining the integrity of AI-generated content. AI-generated content is now abundant and often indistinguishable from that created by humans, significantly influencing public decisions and opinions. The report said one approach to establish authenticity and build a robust AI content detection mechanism is watermarking.Â Governments worldwide are recognising the potential of watermarking technologies. Taking a lead, India can play a pivotal role in shaping a robust domestic digital ecosystem that is secure, transparent, and trustworthy, the report highlighted, the report said. There is a need for multi-layered approaches, with both technological advancements and frameworks. ""Policies are being formulated to promote the adoption of watermarking and establishing global standards for its implementation,"" the report said. Rajnish Gupta, Partner, Tax and Economic Policy Group, EY India, said watermarking is a key solution that enables developers to encrypt watermarks, providing better detection and authenticity of AI-generated content. ""Robust watermarking must resist tampering, and detection systems should maintain low false-positive rates while functioning across different Gen AI platforms"" Gupta was quoted as saying in the release.

"Why the biggest cybersecurity risk to securities market may be difficult to eliminate, according to Deloitte India's Kamdar",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/difficult-to-meet-sebis-deadline-on-cybersecurity-framework-kamdar-deloitte-india-12825160.html,Market," September 19, 2024 / 21:27   ","The biggest riskÂ to cybersecurityÂ in the securities-market system is the dependence on third-party vendors,Â according toÂ Munjal Kamdar, Partner, Deloitte India. But it may be extremely difficult to eliminate this risk. In an interview given to Moneycontrol, Kamdar said that it may not beÂ feasible to entirely removeÂ these vendors from the ecosystem given the crucial role they play. Kamdar, with over two decades in the BFSI sector and who is an expert in cyber regulatory compliance and IT security risk, explains. Also read| Sebi employees assured of a committee to look into workplace demands: Sources Edited excerpts from the interview: Why are third party vendors the biggest cybersecurity risk?Third parties play a crucial role in helping their clients (such as brokers and exchanges) add to their technical capabilities, reduce costs, and improve their services. Given their criticality, reliance on them has increased substantially. Outsourcing has increased exponentially, both in terms of scale and variety of services, in recent years, thereby expanding the attack surface. This is part of the evolving business and IT landscape, driven by specialisation. Third parties develop expertise in certain areas, and clients are motivated to outsource business functions to these specialised entities. Successful organisations are able to balance the benefits with potential risks by employingÂ  risk assessments strategies and monitoring the third parties. What are the challenges faced by intermediaries, such as brokers, and market infrastructure institutions (MIIs), such as exchanges and depositories, in reducing their reliance on vendors? Can third-parties be eliminated entirely from the value chain?Given the crucial roles played by third-party vendors, it may not be feasible to eliminate them entirely. ByÂ theirÂ nature, IT services require specialisation. The expertise developed by third-party service providers, such as in cloud, SaaS, or eKYC, cannot be developed by client organisations. Additionally, these vendors are able to reduce costs by servicing multiple clients with the same services. A standalone broker, without appropriate third-party support, cannot do this at the same cost. Which are the functions for which intermediaries and MIIs rely on vendors the most, and why?Most of the dependence isÂ for IT related servicesÂ â€” application development, maintenance, networks, IT infrastructure, etc. This is due to the lack of IT expertise within organisations. There's alsoÂ dependency on vendorsÂ  for services like eKYC, customer acquisition and sign-up,Â  etc. This is because business services need scale of delivery. Is SEBI consideringÂ making the third-party vendor's conduct and complianceÂ  the responsibility of the registered intermediary? Will the intermediaries be able to manage such a responsibility practically?Per section 1.6 of the CSCRF , the regulated entity (RE) is responsible for identifying, establishing, assessing, and managing cybersecurity risks. Third-party service providers are also mandated to follow similar information security standards as the REs. Frameworks are available for managing and monitoring third party risks. The responsibility for managing these risks falls entirely on the corporation engaging the third parties. You have said that market players recognise that cybersecurity risks are real and need to be dealt with on priority. What are the concrete indicators for this? Cyber-budgets have been increasing over the past few years. However, there are other indicators as well. Deloitte conducts the Voice of Cyber survey every yearÂ among 1,000-plus organisations. The findings for this year told us the following: 1)Â 56Â percent of respondents mentioned that cyber initiatives improved their organisational efficiency. 2)Â 40Â percent mentioned that such initiativesÂ improved customer trust, and 39Â percent mentioned thatÂ theyÂ improved their brand reputation. 3)Â 51Â percent of organisations mentioned that their risk management strategy was the most important initiative for the success of the organisation. Why would it be difficult for brokers and other registered intermediaries to meet the cybersecurity, cyberresilience framework deadline? What is a more reasonable deadline?Â  (Note: On August 20,Â theÂ Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) releasedÂ a Cybersecurity andÂ Cyber ResilienceÂ Framework (CSCRF) â€” which details the standards to be met to ensure cyber-resilience and security, the guidelines to meet them, and formats for compliance â€” on August 20. The regulator has set January 1, 2025 as the implementation deadline for six categories of regulated entities andÂ April 1, 2025, for the rest.Â ) The CSCRF requirements are comprehensive and demand significant investment of time and effort. There are two sets of compliance deadlines. The first applies to six categories of REs already covered by Cyber and Resilience circulars, with a compliance deadline of January 1, 2025. These REs will need to perform a gap assessment and build the missing controls framework, which will require time and effort. They will also need to redraw their audit baseline and reporting. For other REs who were not covered by Cyber and Resilience circulars, the specified deadline of April 1, 2025 will challenge them in defining and implementing the Cyber and Resilience requirements from scratch.

Nifty erases early gains; heavy short build up and relative weakness signal short-term consolidation,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nifty-erases-early-gains-heavy-short-build-up-and-relative-weakness-signal-short-term-consolidation-12825406.html,Market," September 19, 2024 / 15:02   ","Indian benchmark indices cooled off after a strong gap-up opening driven by the Federal Reserve's overnight 50 bps rate cut. In afternoon trade, the Sensex was up 203.95 points or 0.25 percent at 83,152.18, and the Nifty gained 26.1 points or 0.1 percent, closing at 25,403.6. However, the broader market faced selling pressure, with the Nifty Next 50 and the Nifty Midcap Select declining by 1.45 percent and 1.28 percent, respectively. According to experts, the markets are showing signs of weakness, with heavy short positions building up in several stocks. The FMCG sector is expected to demonstrate resilience and provide support to the market. Analysts recommend avoiding mid- and small-cap stocks for now, as they may continue to face heightened volatility and downside risk. â€œWith midcaps and smallcaps having rallied significantly over the past few months, their margin of safety, in terms of valuations, has diminished relative to large-caps. Given this, the broader market may undergo a period of time correction in select pockets, with flows likely shifting towards largecaps,"" said Neeraj Chadawar, head of fundamental and quantitative research at Axis Securities. Nifty Outlook and Strategy Preeti K Chabra, Trade DeltaNifty is trading at an all-time high following the Federal Reserveâ€™s 50 bps rate hike. With the event now behind us, the market seems to be taking a breather, with profit booking seen in several counters. The RSI on the monthly chart is in an overbought zone, signaling potential selling momentum in the medium term. Strategy: Once the 20-hour moving average breaks, a debit spread can be initiated in Nifty by buying the 25,300 PE at Rs 104 (for the 26th September expiry) and selling the 25,200 PE at Rs 80, with a net cost of Rs 20. Sheersham Gupta, director and senior technical analyst at RupeezyThe US Federal Reserve surprised the markets with a 50 bps rate cut, the first in over four years. Importantly, the Fedâ€™s greater confidence in inflation nearing its 2 percent target suggests the possibility of a rate cut cycle in India, which has lagged behind the US and Europe in easing monetary policy. With the festive season approaching, positive sentiment is expected in Indian markets, which typically experience a bullish trend during this period. Although profit booking occurred following todayâ€™s gap-up opening, it appears to be a mild correction. Nifty has strong support at 25,350, and that level needs to be broken for further downside. On the monthly chart, Nifty has formed four consecutive green candlesâ€”a rare patternâ€”indicating limited movement until the next expiry. A breakout following consolidation could push Nifty towards the 26,500â€“27,000 range. Strategy: The metals sector looks promising, as it is trading at historic lows compared to the Nifty. Tata Steel is a standout pick, with a stop loss of Rs 147.8 and a target of Rs 151. Santosh Pasi, derivatives trader and founder of Pasi Technologies Today after Fed's 50 bps cut, everyone was assuming it would go up. But because of profit booking, we are closing red candle today, however if we compare it with yesterday, it is closing slightly positive. Our economic factors are positive and we expect the bullish moment to continue. On any correction, it will be an opportunity to add in the long term portfolio. Sudeep Shah, DVP and head of derivative and technical research at SBI Securities Initially, the market rallied on positive sentiment following the rate cut, but as the session progressed, profit booking set in, with many investors opting to lock in gains. Looking ahead, the 25,150â€“25,050 zone will act as immediate support for the Nifty, being the confluence of the 20-day EMA and the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level of its prior rally (24,753â€“25,611). On the upside, the 25,600â€“25,650 range will serve as immediate resistance. We expect the index to consolidate between 25,650 and 25,000 over the next few sessions. Bank Nifty OutlookÂ  Shah highlights that Bank Nifty is outperforming the broader indices, demonstrating relative strength. ""While there has been some minor profit booking from higher levels, the overall chart structure remains bullish, indicating further upside potential. Immediate support lies in the 52,600â€“52,500 range, and as long as Bank Nifty holds above 52,500, it is likely to continue its upward trajectory, potentially testing 53,500, followed by 53,900 in the short term, "" he added. Going forward, Shah recommends focusing on the Banking and FMCG sectors, as they are showing resilience despite broader market weakness.

The Fed's pivot could also influence the Reserve Bank of India's stance, with some analysts predicting a potential rate cut in the December policy meeting. ""This exerts pressure on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to think about a similar rate cut, especially while the domestic economy is still recovering,"" said Ravi Singh, SVP of Retail Research at Religare Broking. ""We believe equities (risky assets) will do well on the back of US monetary policy normalisation albeit with volatility given there is concern about risk of a hard landing (US recession),"" said Yogesh Kalwani, Head of Investments at InCred Wealth. He also highlighted that, with valuations exceeding long-term averages, the broader market may consolidate, with large-cap and value stocks gaining preference.

Today, the broader market saw a notable correction, with the BSE Midcap index dropping by 0.4 percent and the BSE Smallcap index falling by nearly oneÂ percent. When it comes to individual stocks, HUL, Nestle, Titan, Kotak Mahindra, and NTPC gained 1.3-2.4 percent, leading Nifty 50, while Shriram Finance, Adani Ports, ONGC, Coal India, and BPCL were the biggest losers, down 1.4-3.5 percent.

Follow our market blog to catch all the live updates As the Federal Reserve slashes its benchmark lending rate by 50 basis points, analysts suggested it is a positive for Indian equities as foreign flows will invest more money in emerging markets, especially Indian equities. The RBI is soon expected to follow in the Federal Reserve's footsteps, cutting rates. However, there are certain recessionary fears with some participants believing that the American central bank took such a drastic step - cutting rates by 50 basis points, instead of the largely expected 25 basis points - because USA could be veering towards the recession territory. Therefore, along IT and pharmaÂ which are considered defensive sectors, consumption has a theme has also garnered favour. Another key reason for the bullishness on consumption comes from the populist budget, which had a high focus on the recovery in the rural sector.Â The finance minister announced measures to spur employment, a key pain point of the lower- and middle-class. Additionally, with the measures to boost agricultural income coupled with the predications of a normal monsoon, rural demand might see a turn-around.

Reduce SBI Cards; target of Rs 700: Emkay Global Financial,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/reduce-sbi-cards-target-of-rs-700-emkay-global-financial-12825429.html,Stocks," September 19, 2024 / 15:14   ","Emkay Global Financial's research report on SBI Cards Amid rising hopes of a policy rate cut in CY25, we believe SBI Cards with its fixed rate asset portfolio and higher share of borrowings maturing in <1 year, could benefit on the margins front which has stabilized after a prolonged contraction cycle. However, asset quality has deteriorated meaningfully with GNPA/Stage 2 pool already rising to 3.1%/6.2% of loans in 1QFY25 from 2.4%/5.3% a year ago. Our industry level channel checks suggest that the overall stress build-up in the card business remains elevated, which coupled with the regulatory salvo on unsecured loans could hurt business growth. This has already reflected in SBICâ€™s slower card acquisition (<1mn in 1Q) and thus the continued loss in CIF/spend market share. Factoring slower growth and higher charge off amid rising NPAs, we expect SBIC to report sub-optimal RoAs at 3.6-4%. Outlook Given the lower Tier I capital (16.8%) following the increase in RWA by RBI, SBIC also needs to raise capital sooner than later.

Nifty erases early gains; heavy short build up and relative weakness signal short-term consolidation,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nifty-erases-early-gains-heavy-short-build-up-and-relative-weakness-signal-short-term-consolidation-12825406.html,Stocks," September 19, 2024 / 15:02   ","Indian benchmark indices cooled off after a strong gap-up opening driven by the Federal Reserve's overnight 50 bps rate cut. In afternoon trade, the Sensex was up 203.95 points or 0.25 percent at 83,152.18, and the Nifty gained 26.1 points or 0.1 percent, closing at 25,403.6. However, the broader market faced selling pressure, with the Nifty Next 50 and the Nifty Midcap Select declining by 1.45 percent and 1.28 percent, respectively. According to experts, the markets are showing signs of weakness, with heavy short positions building up in several stocks. The FMCG sector is expected to demonstrate resilience and provide support to the market. Analysts recommend avoiding mid- and small-cap stocks for now, as they may continue to face heightened volatility and downside risk. â€œWith midcaps and smallcaps having rallied significantly over the past few months, their margin of safety, in terms of valuations, has diminished relative to large-caps. Given this, the broader market may undergo a period of time correction in select pockets, with flows likely shifting towards largecaps,"" said Neeraj Chadawar, head of fundamental and quantitative research at Axis Securities. Nifty Outlook and Strategy Preeti K Chabra, Trade DeltaNifty is trading at an all-time high following the Federal Reserveâ€™s 50 bps rate hike. With the event now behind us, the market seems to be taking a breather, with profit booking seen in several counters. The RSI on the monthly chart is in an overbought zone, signaling potential selling momentum in the medium term. Strategy: Once the 20-hour moving average breaks, a debit spread can be initiated in Nifty by buying the 25,300 PE at Rs 104 (for the 26th September expiry) and selling the 25,200 PE at Rs 80, with a net cost of Rs 20. Sheersham Gupta, director and senior technical analyst at RupeezyThe US Federal Reserve surprised the markets with a 50 bps rate cut, the first in over four years. Importantly, the Fedâ€™s greater confidence in inflation nearing its 2 percent target suggests the possibility of a rate cut cycle in India, which has lagged behind the US and Europe in easing monetary policy. With the festive season approaching, positive sentiment is expected in Indian markets, which typically experience a bullish trend during this period. Although profit booking occurred following todayâ€™s gap-up opening, it appears to be a mild correction. Nifty has strong support at 25,350, and that level needs to be broken for further downside. On the monthly chart, Nifty has formed four consecutive green candlesâ€”a rare patternâ€”indicating limited movement until the next expiry. A breakout following consolidation could push Nifty towards the 26,500â€“27,000 range. Strategy: The metals sector looks promising, as it is trading at historic lows compared to the Nifty. Tata Steel is a standout pick, with a stop loss of Rs 147.8 and a target of Rs 151. Santosh Pasi, derivatives trader and founder of Pasi Technologies Today after Fed's 50 bps cut, everyone was assuming it would go up. But because of profit booking, we are closing red candle today, however if we compare it with yesterday, it is closing slightly positive. Our economic factors are positive and we expect the bullish moment to continue. On any correction, it will be an opportunity to add in the long term portfolio. Sudeep Shah, DVP and head of derivative and technical research at SBI Securities Initially, the market rallied on positive sentiment following the rate cut, but as the session progressed, profit booking set in, with many investors opting to lock in gains. Looking ahead, the 25,150â€“25,050 zone will act as immediate support for the Nifty, being the confluence of the 20-day EMA and the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level of its prior rally (24,753â€“25,611). On the upside, the 25,600â€“25,650 range will serve as immediate resistance. We expect the index to consolidate between 25,650 and 25,000 over the next few sessions. Bank Nifty OutlookÂ  Shah highlights that Bank Nifty is outperforming the broader indices, demonstrating relative strength. ""While there has been some minor profit booking from higher levels, the overall chart structure remains bullish, indicating further upside potential. Immediate support lies in the 52,600â€“52,500 range, and as long as Bank Nifty holds above 52,500, it is likely to continue its upward trajectory, potentially testing 53,500, followed by 53,900 in the short term, "" he added. Going forward, Shah recommends focusing on the Banking and FMCG sectors, as they are showing resilience despite broader market weakness.

Cementâ€™s $100 billion illusion: Kotak says current valuations devoid of logic,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/cements-100-billion-illusion-kotak-says-current-valuations-devoid-of-logic-12825360.html,Stocks," September 19, 2024 / 13:30   ","The trouble for cement firms is far from over as expects expect the companies to end the first-half FY25 with higher than expected raw material costs, amid weak pricing and sluggish demand. Amid this, the current valuation of Indian cement companies appears increasingly unreasonable, according to Kotak Institutional Equities, especially considering the staggering $100 billion market capitalization of listed firms in the sector. This figure raises serious questions about the underlying fundamentals of the industry, particularly regarding the volume of cement these companies would need to sell to justify such valuations, the brokerage said in a recent strategy report. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action Kotak's analysis revealed that to match this market cap, Indian cement companies would need to sell approximately 20 billion tons of cement on an undiscounted basis, over 150 billion tons on a discounted basis (assuming a cost of equity of 12 percent), or an astronomical figure of 40 to 60 billion tons over the next 30 years, depending on the discounted cash flow (DCF) calculations. A staggering $100 billion market cap, but can they deliver? The implied volumes necessary to support these valuations are incredulous, according to Kotak. In fact, analysts noted a near-zero probability of achieving such sales levels, particularly when they examine the context of Indiaâ€™s GDP growth trajectory. To put this into perspective, China sold 44 billion tons of cement from 1995 to 2023 when its GDP grew at a rapid CAGR of 12 percent. It sold 34 billion tons during its peak growth phase from 2007 to 2023,Â  when GDP registered a growth of 10 percent CAGR.  Kotak identified 1994 as a key starting point for comparison, as China's cement sales volumes at the time were around 400 million tonsâ€”similar to Indiaâ€™s projected FY24 volumes of 419 million tons. The year 2007 also served as a significant benchmark, with Chinaâ€™s GDP per capita at US$2,700, closely aligned with Indiaâ€™s FY24 GDP per capita of US$2,600. Kotak noted that while the cement sector's profitability could exceed Kotak's assumed figure of US$5 per ton, historically however, it has often fallen short of market expectations. Nevertheless, cement companies have achieved a decent Cash Return on Capital Invested (CRoCI) during this time, suggesting that the assumed profit per ton is not unreasonably low. Cement firms' PE multiples devoid of valuation logic The analysis revealed strongly that the current market dynamics for Indian cement companies suggest a severe disconnect between valuation and underlying business fundamentals. In fact, the brokerage has challenged the street's approach to valuing cement stocks. It argued that a capex-intensive commodity business with a low fixed-asset turnover ratio of around 1x should not command high P/E or EV/EBITDA multiples. Each additional unit of volume requires significant investment, which negatively impacts free cash flow (FCF) and results in a low FCF-to-profit-after-tax (PAT) ratio. Given these factors, the current 30-40x P/E multiples for cement stocks lack sound valuation logic, Kotak said.

Hefty merchant banking fees: IPO could be a success but stock could well be in doldrums,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hefty-merchant-banking-fees-ipo-could-be-a-success-but-stock-could-well-be-in-doldrums-12825117.html,Stocks," September 19, 2024 / 11:58   ","A hefty fee, which is significantly higher than the industry average, paid to a merchant banker may well ensure the success of an initial public offer (IPO) but it will not in any way guarantee the post-listing performance of a company, which is more linked to factors like fundamentals and governance among other things. And if there was any proof needed then one need not look very far. The current calendar year has seen two mainboard IPOs in which the merchant banking fee was in excess of seven percent of the issue size – significantly higher than the industry average of 2-3 percent. Even if one considers the smaller-sized issues of less than Rs 500 crore, the average merchant banking fee has been less than four percent for IPOs. Take the example of Saraswati Saree Depot. The Kolhapur-based company launched its Rs 160 crore IPO in August and was subscribed nearly 47 times. Data from Prime Database shows that the company paid 7.82 percent as merchant banking fee. Interestingly, the stock has fallen almost 17 percent since listing even though the benchmark Sensex has been up nearly three percent during the period. While the financials of the company may look robust, analysts have certain concerns about the company. Saraswati Saree Depot's business is a high-volume and low-margin business and it is dependent on third-party suppliers for sourcing its products which is a major risk, said Swastika Investmart in a note. The company operates exclusively in the wholesale segment and does not have any presence in the retail market. “The absence of ownership of any retail brands subjects them to a certain degree of risk due to a potential lack of visibility in the public domain and this would lead to a reduced market share for the company,” said Canara Bank Securities in a report. Another company, BLS E-Services, launched its IPO in January this year to raise Rs 310 crore. The issue was subscribed a massive 83 times with the company paying the merchant banker 7.24 percent of the issue size as fees. The stock of the company is down 27 percent since listing even as the Sensex gained 15 percent during the period.  Experts said that at times companies are forced to pay higher fees to the bankers if the financials and other fundamentals are not robust. “If the company is difficult to sell, investment banking fees could be high,” said the head of a leading investment banking firm. There could also be instances where bankers that are charging higher fees are providing more than listing services, says Nirav Karkera of Fisdom. “These services could be creating enough demand by doing roadshows post listing, or through the listing also. Many companies are trying to go for an IPO, so the banker has the ability to squeeze higher fees in some deals where certain investment bankers are not willing to touch,” he said. Another person, on the condition of anonymity, said, “If people are going to happily subscribe for an IPO, why should the company pay a higher fee to the banker? The company will pay more fees only if the general narrative towards the company is weak and the banker is incentivised to ensure high subscription.” Incidentally, 2024 is not the only year which has such instances. Way back in 2005, Pyramid Retail paid 12.07 percent of the issue size as merchant banking fees. The retail chain was acquired in 2007 after which it went downhill and while there were efforts to revive the company by re-branding stores, the strategy did not work due to the poor financials as well as economic downturn. Another company, Bartronics India, which listed in December 2005, paid 7.7 percent as merchant banking fee. The company was suspended from trading in 2022. However, not every company which paid the highest fee in 2024 has shown poor performance.Platinum Industries, which paid 6.31 percent as merchant banking fees, has seen its stock price surge 76 percent since listing in February as compared to Sensex returns of 12 percent. Similarly, shares of J G Chemicals have surged 136 percent as compared to Sensex gain of 14 percent since its listing in March. The company paid 5.52 percent of the issue size as fees.

"Vodafone Idea, Indus Towers shares plummet 15% as Supreme Court upholds AGR ruling",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/vodafone-idea-indus-towers-shares-locked-in-at-10-lower-circuit-as-supreme-court-upholds-agr-ruling-12825179.html,Stocks," September 19, 2024 / 14:31   ","Telecom stocks faced selling pressure during September 19 trade as the Supreme Court rejected telecommunication companies' plea for the re-computation of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea were among the telcos to have filed the curative petition, alleging grave error in the calculation of dues the department of telecommunication. Shares of debt-laden telecom operator Vodafone Idea crashed over 15 percent. At 12.45 pm, Vi shares were quoting Rs 11.41 apiece on the NSE. Meanwhile Indus Towers' stock price which had plummeted over 14 percent, trimmed losses to quote Rs 397, down 7.5 percent. Bharti Airtel shares were quoting Rs 1,701 apiece, up two percent on the NSE. On August 28, 2024, Indus Towers' board approved a share buyback of 5.67 crore shares, which will increase Bharti Airtel's stake in the company to over 50 percent. This will made Indus Towers a subsidiary of Bharti Airtel. Follow our live blog to catch all the updates Vodafone Idea's curative petition in the AGR case sought three main reliefs: correcting arithmetic and clerical errors in the AGR demand; requesting that the penalty be limited to 50 percent of the shortfall; and revising the interest rate on the penalty to 2 percent above the State Bank of India's prime lending rate. According to IIFL Securities, the cash flow situation for Vodafone Idea is expected to become more challenging without relief from the court. The dismissal of the curative petition brings a slight positive outlook for Bharti Airtel, especially concerning potential market share gains. However, it remains to be seen whether Vodafone Idea can proceed with its debt-raising plans following the unfavorable Supreme Court verdict. Raising debt is crucial for Vodafone Idea to continue with its capital expenditure plans. On September 6, Goldman Sachs reaffirmed its bearish rating on beleaguered telco Vodafone Idea. The brokerage believes that the country’s third-largest telecom operator will be unable to stop the relentless erosion of its market-share, despite its recent capital raise. “Our analysis suggests a direct correlation between capex and revenue market share, and given our expectation of peers spending at least 50 percent higher capex versus Vodafone Idea, we forecast another 300 bps share loss for the company over the next 3-4 years,” said Goldman Sachs in its report. In an optimistic scenario - where the company's adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues are slashed by 65 percent, tariffs consistently increase, and no near-term government repayments are required - Goldman sees a best-case implied value per share of Rs 19. On July 15, the Supreme Court acknowledged Vodafone Idea's submission challenging its 2019 ruling on payments owed to the government.

The investors seem to have acknowledged the remarkable transformational journey of KVB under the current management with steady growth and superior RoA. The management explained the hard work behind the numbers, suggesting that superior performance / delivery on NIM, growth, asset quality and RoA are structural and outcome of the multiple initiatives undertaken. The bank acknowledged headwinds on systemic deposits growth, NIM and credit costs but explained the steps it is taking to mitigate the same. The bank has one of the lowest LDRs (83%) and one of the highest LCRs (185%), and thus, should sustain ~15% CAGR in loan for FY24â€“26E. KVBâ€™s all-inclusive SMA 1+2 (<0.5%) and NNPA (<0.4%), being amongst the lowest, alongside its limited (<3%) exposure to unsecured retail, nourishes our confidence of benign credit costs. Outlook Our estimates are unchanged. Overall, we expect KVB to sustain its leadership on RoA/RoE within mid and small private banks space. Maintain BUY with an unchanged target price of INR 270, valuing the stock at ~1.6x FY26E ABV. Key risk is slower-than-expected deposits growth impacting growth and NIM.

RBI's rate cut dilemma: Keep pace with Fed's 50 bps slash or take slow path to easing?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/rbis-rate-cut-dilemma-keep-pace-with-feds-50-bps-slash-or-take-slow-path-to-easing-12825073.html,Stocks," September 19, 2024 / 10:04   ","The US Federal Reserve's aggressive 50 bps rate cut came on expected lines, turning the spotlight on whether the Reserve Bank of India will follow suit in its upcoming monetary policy meeting. Analysts remain divided on this prospect; some foresee a rate cut as early as October, while others predict a delay until December or even 2025. The cautious stance stems from the fact that India's robust economic growth and the ongoing challenge of elevated food inflation, which, although easing, will continue to shape the central bank's decision-making. The RBI still has the flexibility to remain focused on domestic inflation and risk management, albeit there are over 20 days before its next MPC meeting, according to Emkay Global. The brokerage believes that RBI is likely to maintain its wait-and-watch stance and focus on being â€˜actively disinflationaryâ€™, with the first rate cut likely by December. ""A case for an early cut is still less likely, and we continue to see shallow cuts by both Fed and the RBI in this cycle,"" said Madhavi Arora, Lead Economist at Emkay Global Financial Services. Meanwhile, analysts at Nomura believe that an inflection in Indiaâ€™s monetary policy cycle is around the corner, and it is unlikely to be shallow. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action ""We expect the RBI to cut its policy rate by a cumulative 100bp to 5.50 percent by mid-2025, starting with a surprise rate cut this October,"" they said, adding that while the initial easing will realign nominal rates with lower inflation, rate cuts in 2025 will likely be triggered by weaker growth. However, the brokerage cautioned that RBI could postpone its pivot as it waits for more evidence of food disinflation or to save policy space for a rainy day. ""We could be wrong on the economic outlook (growth or inflation). That said, if we are right on the economic outlook, then a delay by the RBI to cut rates is unlikely to change the magnitude of the easing in this cycle,"" it added. Sujan Hajra, Chief Economist & Executive Director, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers view Fed's 50 bps rate cut as an aggressive start to the easing cycle, aimed at preemptively mitigating the risk of a hard landing. However, the growth and inflation dynamics in India differ significantly from those in the U.S., as do the relative policy rate levels compared to historical norms, he noted. As a result, Hajra does not expect the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to follow the Fed's lead. ""Our expectation remains that the RBI will maintain its current policy stance and refrain from initiating a rate cut cycle within this calendar year,"" he told Moneycontrol. While US Fed Chair Jerome Powell in his speech highlighted the strength of the US economy, noting a cooling labour market and eased inflation, the 50 bps rate cut decision raises questions about longer-term stability and potential risks, said Swapnil Aggarwal, Director, VSRK Capital. The full impact on India's economy will depend on how the US economy evolves and how global investors adjust their portfolios, he said, adding, ""The Reserve Bank of India may consider a pre-emptive 25 to 50 basis points rate cut before 2025"". Also Read |Â Sensex, Nifty soar to fresh record highs on Fed rate cut euphoria; IT, banking lead gains Offering a contrary view, SBI Chairman C S Setty, said that RBI is unlikely to cut the benchmark policy rate in 2024 due to food inflation concerns, according. Despite potential rate cuts by the Fed, the RBI will focus on long-term inflation trends before making any decisions. ""While Fed rate cut would influence everyone, RBI would be mindful of the food inflation before taking a call on interest rate cut,"" Setty told PTI in an interview.

The price rose over a percent to Rs 977 on the NSE. With a price target of Rs 1,175, Emkay forecasts an upside potential of about 22 percent. The Tata Motors stock has seen quite a correction, slipping nearly 13 percent in the past month. Follow our LIVE blog for all the latest market updates The brokerage notes that while China remains a relatively smaller market for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), the company's profitability and deleveraging story remain intact. In the domestic market, Tata Motors is seeing an improved demand and margin outlook for its commercial vehicle (CV) business. Additionally, in the passenger vehicle (PV) segment, the company is better positioned than the industry, with successful new launches and lower inventory levels. Emkay highlights a healthy profitability outlook for Tata Motors, coupled with undemanding valuations, making it an attractive buy at current levels. This downturn in the counter comes afterÂ UBS Securities retained its 'sell' call on India's largest EV player, citing further downside risk from margin slippage at the company's luxury arm Jaguar Land Rover and within the domestic passenger vehicles segment. Accordingly, UBS retained its price target of Rs 825 for Tata Motors stock, implying a downside potential of over 20 percent from the previous close. The brokerage remains cautious as it believes the extended successful run of JLR's premium models--Defender, Range Rover and Range Rover Sport have started to moderate. It noted that the order book for this trio has now hit pre-COVID levels and soon expects discounts for Range Rover to rise. On Tuesday,Â 1.9 crore shares or 0.4 percent of the total equity of the company changed hands in a block deal.Â Trust Deed, TML Securities Trust sold 1.14 crore shares on the stock exchanges today for the purpose of distribution of fractional share entitlement.
