"PPF, Sukanya Samriddhi: 5 new rules for your small-savings account. Here’s what you need to know",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/ppf-sukanya-samriddhi-5-new-rules-for-your-small-savings-account-heres-what-you-need-to-know-12816995.html,general," September 08, 2024 / 17:14   ","For those who have multiple small savings accounts underÂ the Public Provident Fund (PPF), the Sukanya Samriddhi Account Scheme (SSAS), or the now defunct NSS-87 (National Savings Scheme), thereâ€™s trouble. The government has announced new rulesÂ pertaining to investors who have opened multiple accounts over the years, which had gone unnoticed so far. Hereâ€™s what they mean. Not more than one PPF account In a circular that the Ministry of Finance issued on July 12, it reiterated that investors in PPF can open (or continue to have) only one account. IfÂ they're found to have two accounts,Â they will be asked to designate one of those accounts as the primary one. The money that lies in the secondary account will then be transferred to the first one. Bear in mind that you need to deposit a minimum of Rs 500 per year in a PPF account. The maximum you can depositÂ is Rs 1.5 lakh. The excess amount in the secondary account will beÂ given back to the investor atÂ zero percent interest, effective July 12. Per PPFÂ  rulesÂ  notified in 2019 and amended in 2020, you are allowed to open one PPF account on your own behalf. If you are found to have more than two PPF accounts, you will have to forego all the interest youâ€™ve earned so far (from the date of opening the account) onÂ  accountsÂ other than your primary and secondary ones. Only one PPF account per minor In addition to your own PPF account, you are also allowed to open one account on behalf ofÂ a minor, as per the PPF rules, 2020. Here too, you need to invest a minimum of Rs 500,Â or a maximum of Rs 1.5 lakh a year. In the case of minorsÂ as well, the government has observed that investors had opened multiple accounts in the name of their children. This will need to stop. Once the guardians recognise one minor account as the main account, the other accounts in the name of the same minor will be classified as â€˜irregular accounts.â€™ Effective July 12, while the minor's regular PPF account will continue to earn interest at the prevailing rate (7.1 percent), the irregular account will earn the Post-Office Savings Account (PoSA) interest rate (4 percent at present) till the child turns 18. The irregular account will not be closed, though. Once the child turns 18, the irregular PPF account willÂ be treated the same as way as an adult's second PPF account, for an adult can have only one PPF account at a time, per current rules. NRIs cannot have residency PPF account For those who have been investing in PPF accounts without disclosing their NRI status, it willÂ cease to be business as usual. These accounts will earn the PoSA interest rate between July 12 Â and September 30, 2024. Thereafter, theyÂ will earnÂ zeroÂ interest. Per PPF rules, a non-resident Indian (NRI) cannot open a PPF account. However, if you become an NRI after youâ€™ve opened a PPF accountÂ as a residentÂ Indian, then you are allowed to continue investing in the existing account till it matures; however, no extensions will be granted, unlike an Indian citizen who can extend her PPF by five years. In 1997, the government changed the rules and prohibited NRIs from continuing to invest in their existing PPF accounts once they changed their residency status to NRI. At the time, it had said that if PPF accounts are found where the investor had changed her residence from Indian to NRI, such accounts will be closed from the date of change in status, and the PoSA rate of interest would be paid from this dateÂ till theÂ account is closed. Subsequently, in 2018, the PPF rules allowed NRIs to continue investing in existing PPF accountsÂ  tillÂ  maturity, with no extensions allowed. The latest rule applies to NRIs who continued with their PPF accounts that earned them the regular PPF rate and did not disclose their change in residency status. Grandparents cannot open Sukanya Samriddhi accounts The government has reiterated that the Sukanya Samriddhi Account (SSAS) can only be opened by the guardian of the girl child. It has been found that many people had opened SSAS accounts for their grandchildren. The new rules now state that only legalÂ  or natural guardians (parents) can open SSAS accounts. If grandparents are found to have opened such accounts, then the guardianship will be shifted to the parents or legal guardian of the girl child in whose name the account has been opened. SSAS is a popular small-savings scheme that can be opened in the name of a girl child below the age of 10. The account is operative till the child turns 18. The scheme currently pays an interest rate of 8.2 percent per annum. You can open one SSAS per girl child and a maximum of two such accounts in a family, unless the family has had twins or triplets. National Savings Scheme shut down The National Savings Scheme (NSS) was a popular small-savings scheme, and you could earlier open an NSS account at any post-office. The scheme was introduced in 1992 andÂ  discontinued in 2002. Per the schemeâ€™s rules, you could withdrawÂ yourÂ deposits after four years of investment,Â while the interest could be withdrawn at any time. What made the scheme immensely popular was that it paid an interest of 7.5 percent per annum, even though the rate had come down all the way from its peak of 11 percent. However, effective July 12,Â till September 30, the first account opened under this scheme will continue. ButÂ subsequentÂ accounts will earn you the PoSA rate, plus 200 basis points, or 6 percent. Keep in mind that you could only have Â invested a maximum of Rs 40,000 per year in this. If you have multiple NSS accounts, the total amount would be subject to this limit, and the excess will be returned to the investor. Effective October 1, your primary account too, will earn zero interest, which is as good as being shut down.

US CPI in the spotlight next week as markets seek clarity on Fed's first rate cut,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/commodities/us-cpi-in-the-spotlight-next-week-as-markets-seek-clarity-on-feds-first-rate-cut-12817159.html,general," September 08, 2024 / 23:13   ","By Kaynat Chainwala, AVP Commodity Research at Kotak Securities Markets ended on a weaker note as the highly anticipated US jobs report failed to provide clarity on the scale of potential rate cuts, leaving traders disappointed. The US dollar experienced significant fluctuations as moderating US inflation pushed the dollar to 101.91, followed by a sharp pullback to 100.58 as lower-than-expected private payrolls and weaker jobs openings increased bets on bigger rate cuts. Nevertheless, the mixed official jobs report left the debate over a 25 or 50 bps rate cut unresolved, helping the dollar rebound and close above 101. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 1,42,000 last month, bringing the three-month average to its lowest level since mid-2020. Meanwhile, unemployment rate decreased to 4.2 percent, marking its first decline in five months; average hourly earnings rose by 0.4 percent on a monthly basis and 3.8 percent year-over-year, surpassing estimates. This mixed data suggested both a potential slowdown in the labour market and uncertainty over the September rate cut outlook, contributing to the worst weekly losses for US equities this year during the first week of September, a historically challenging month for markets. COMEX Gold traded within a narrow range throughout the week as traders awaited the US jobs data for insights into the Federal Reserve's potential rate cut path. Gold saw a sharp rise to $2,560 per ounce on Friday before retreating and closing the week flat at $2,526.8 per ounce, while silver fell 3 percent to $28 per troy ounce, in line with the dollar's rebound following the jobs report. On the daily chart, MCX Silver December futures fell dramatically on Friday, marking the biggest daily drop (-2.59 percent) in a month. Price also closed lowest in the recent three weeks. On the weekly and daily charts, the price is trading below the 20 EMA and Supertrend (7,3), indicating a bearish bias. Price may maintain its negative momentum next week, finding initial support at Rs 80,440 per kg, which if broken and sustained, may see bears bring prices down to the next support level of Rs 79,000. On the flip side, the nearest resistance is at Rs 85,945, followed by Rs 88,350. WTI crude oil extended its losses into September and slipped to a 14-month low of $67.17 per barrel due to concerns over US and Chinese demand amid a potential resolution of the Libyan political dispute. Despite OPEC's announcement to not increase output by 180,000 barrels per day in October and November and a drop in US oil stocks to a one-year low, prices struggled to gain upward momentum. LME base metals also faced significant losses this week, driven by weak manufacturing PMI numbers from the US and China, which dented demand prospects. Additionally, disappointing new home sales data from China indicated that efforts to address the real estate downturn and boost economic activity have not been successful. Zinc led the declines, plunging 6Â percent amid ongoing issues at Chinese steel mills. Upcoming key data releases from China could add further downward pressure on crude oil and metal prices if they continue to reflect a bleak economic outlook. Cooling inflation and tepid growth have sharply increased the likelihood of a 25 basis point rate cut by the ECB in its upcoming policy meeting. However, US CPI will capture the most attention from market participants as one of the final indicators before the FOMC's rate decision on September 18, with persistent inflation potentially reducing the likelihood of a 50 basis point rate cut.

"Stockology: Wait for the bounce to exit, markets may close in the positive by the end of the week",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/stockology-wait-for-the-bounce-to-exit-markets-may-close-in-the-positive-by-the-end-of-the-week-12816895.html,general," September 08, 2024 / 13:30   ","Stockology is a weekly column by futurologist Mahesh Gowande. He is the Founder and Director of Ayan Analytics, which has developed ZodiacAnalyst, a research software with time and price charting tools. Read previous columns here ReviewAs expected, slowly and steadily, the markets have started showing signs of a short-term bearish trend. Frontline PSUÂ andÂ defence stocks have corrected and they could decline further. The need forÂ a defensive investment strategy is clear, and a lot of new investment is flowing towards stable businesses like FMCG, pharma, and tech. Last Friday's single-candle fall is going to hurt investors big time. The way in which action has suddenly picked up in the microcap space is clearly an indication of trend reversal in the coming few days. Technical The lastÂ three days of the previous week clearlyÂ showed signs of a short-term price correctionÂ of 4 to 7 percent, andÂ six toÂ eight months of time correction. Most sector leaders have given a clearÂ  sell signal. The euphoric defence sector has already seen a big correction of more than 15 percent in many scrips. PSUs, which have been in a speculative mode, have also emitted sell signals and a deep correction cannot be ruled out. After reaching new highs, there was a lack of follow-up buying, and the markets dropped below the low of August 26th within three trading sessions. The recommended strategy now is to sell on any price increases, especially if previous stop levels have been broken. The other technical levels mentioned last week remain the same. Now buying is expected in the 24,530-23,450 zone. Time mapCurrently, the sun is transiting nakshatra PurvaÂ which is ruled by Venus,Â and giving an opportunity to book profits and reduce exposure. In loss-making positions, current bounce levels can be used to book lossesÂ and stop further bleeding. Once the sun ingresses nakshatra Uttara, the fall willÂ  pick up pace and that will extend losses, making things worse. So wherever selling has been triggered, ensure you get out early. There areÂ sixÂ solar weeks in a year when volatility expands or contracts suddenly, creatingÂ nice trading opportunities. Auto and defence are likely to fall further. Most metals will also fall. Cement stocksÂ are showing signs of bottoming out. But the time map is positive forÂ  banks and insurance stocks. On 12th sun 90 Jupiter is an important aspect, and from the next day theÂ sun will ingress Uttara, which means that divergence indicators will give the best results and a lot of money can be made in the next 30 days.

"Daily Voice: After 25,000, here is why Ashika Global's Amit Jain taking cautious approach for Nifty and broader market for at least next 6 months",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/daily-voice-after-25000-here-is-why-ashika-globals-amit-jain-taking-cautious-approach-for-nifty-and-broader-market-for-at-least-next-6-months-12816819.html,general," September 08, 2024 / 06:24   ","After achieving 25,000 mark, Amit Jain, the Co-Founder of Ashika Global Family Office Services is taking a cautious approach for the Nifty as well as broader market for at least next 6 months. From here on, the market may be very volatile around US elections, he feels. Among sectors, Amit, who has over 14 years of experience in the Indian Banking & Financial Services Industry, is bullish on the PSU banks and very few PSUs at today's prices. On the Ola Electric Mobility, he is cautious at current valuations. ""While some brokerages see potential upside, the current high valuation coupled with significant volatility suggests caution for new investors."" Do you see the chances of continuation of major upside in the equity market than major downside in coming months? What are the key triggers? In my last interview on 18th August, 2023 with Money Control I said that Nifty will touch 25,000 which is now a reality. In the last 1 year, Nifty has given 27 percent return which is a fantastic performance by all standards. In the last 1 year, the Indian stock market has outpaced all other global stock markets in the world. However, now after accomplishing our target of Nifty @ 25,000. We are taking a cautious approach for the Nifty and broader market for at least next 6 months. From here on, the market may be very volatile around US elections which may create opportunities for fresh investment for medium to long term investors. Do you see the big flow of IPOs (mainboard) in coming months considering the healthy equity market conditions? With the Nifty 50 and Sensex reaching record highs, the Indian equity markets are poised for a surge in mainboard IPOs in the coming quarters. High-profile companies, such as Bajaj Housing Finance and Hyundai Motor India, are launching their IPOs soon. The successful listing of recent IPOs has demonstrated strong investor appetite. The market's ability to absorb a significant number of IPOs remains to be seen. Are you taking a cautious approach while investing in SME IPOs? Yes, Indeed. Although investors have made a lot of money in the SME IPOs. We hold a cautious view on SME IPOs. Only after thorough analysis, people should make a decision of applying in these SME IPOs. We have been noticing a huge up-trend in them. When allocating the investments of our Global Family Offices, we make sure that the companies that we invest in are always fundamentally strong with an upside on the growth prospect. Which are the sectors on your radar for investment now? As we are expecting a market correction in both the Global and Indian Stock Markets, we have identified particular sectors and even in those sectors we are bullish on very specific stocks. This is because unlike the bull run we have witnessed in the first half of the year is a thing of the past and only very specific stocks will be generating alpha going forward. With the current market situation, I am bullish on the PSU Banks and very few PSUs at today's prices. From the index, I like Bank of Baroda, Bank Of India at current levels. Your take on Bajaj Housing Finance IPO? Bajaj Housing Finance's upcoming IPO presents a compelling opportunity, but it warrants a cautious approach. As a subsidiary of Bajaj Finance, it benefits from a robust brand reputation and strong backing. The company has a solid track record of profitability, low delinquency rates, and a diverse loan portfolio, which enhances its appeal in the growing housing finance sector. However, potential investors should consider risks such as rising interest rates and competitive pricing. The IPO's size of Rs 6,560 crore indicates significant market interest, but careful analysis of its financial health and market conditions is essential to make an informed investment decision. Do you think Ola is still an overvalued stock? Ola Electric's stock seems overvalued, especially after its recent surge, which has seen it trading at a valuation higher than Tesla. Despite a 107 percent increase from its IPO price, the company's market capitalization reached approximately Rs 55,000 crore, while it reported widening losses of Rs 347 crore in the last quarter. We are cautious on this stock at current valuations. While some brokerages see potential upside, the current high valuation coupled with significant volatility suggests caution for new investors.

The patient has been isolated in a designated hospital and is currently stable, the ministry further said. ""Samples from the patient are being tested to confirm the presence of Mpox. The case is being managed in line with established protocols, and contact tracing is ongoing to identify potential sources and assess the impact within the country,"" according to a statement issued by the Health Ministry. The development of this case is consistent with the earlier risk assessment conducted by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and there is no cause of any undue concern, it said. The country is fully prepared to deal with such isolated travel-related cases and has robust measures in place to manage and mitigate any potential risk, the ministry added. MPox: What is it Mpox is an infectious disease that can cause a painful rash, enlarged lymph nodes, fever, headache, muscle ache, back pain and low energy. Most people fully recover, but some get very sick. Mpox is caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV). It is an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus of the Orthopoxvirus genus in the Poxviridae family, which includes variola, cowpox, vaccinia and other viruses. There are two distinct clades of the virus: clade I (with subclades Ia and Ib) and clade II (with subclades IIa and IIb). Transmission of Mpox Mpox spreads from person to person mainly through close contact with someone who has mpox, including members of a household. Close contact includes skin-to-skin (such as touching or sex) and mouth-to-mouth or mouth-to-skin contact (such as kissing), and it can also include being face-to-face with someone who has mpox (such as talking or breathing close to one another, which can generate infectious respiratory particles). People with multiple sexual partners are at higher risk of acquiring mpox. People can also contract mpox from contaminated objects such as clothing or linen, through needle injuries in health care, or in community settings such as tattoo parlours. Signs and symptoms of Mpox:Â  RashFeverSore throatHeadacheMuscle achesBack painLow energySwollen lymph nodes.For some people, the first symptom of mpox is a rash, while others may have fever, muscle aches or sore throat first.

According to the government sources to CNBC-TV18, PPF accounts that have been opened solely in the name of a minor without a guardian are considered irregular. The new rules address only these irregular accounts that deviate from established scheme guidelines. The circular aims to address several cases where accounts were opened in the name of minors to circumvent the limit of one PPF account per person. The primary objective is to regularise these accounts and prevent individuals from exploiting the system. The government also confirmed that PPF accounts can be legitimately opened for minors, provided they are done with a guardian involved. This step is intended to ensure adherence to PPF guidelines and to rectify any deviations from the rules.

"Rajnath Singh says India open to talks if Pakistan stops J&K terrorism, urges PoK residents to join India",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/jk-assembly-elections-rajnath-singh-says-india-open-to-talks-if-pakistan-stops-jk-terrorism-urges-pok-to-join-india-12817035.html,general," September 08, 2024 / 17:38   ","India's Defence Minister, Rajnath Singh, announced on September 8 that the country is open to dialogue with Pakistan, provided it halts support for terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. Speaking at an election rally in Ramban district in support of BJP candidate Mohd Saleem Bhat, Singh said that the revocation of Article 370, which had granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, was essential to end the region's misery and foster prosperity. “Pakistan must take one step—stop supporting terrorism. Who wouldn't want improved relations with their neighbours? You can change friends, but not neighbours. We want better relations with Pakistan, but terrorism must end first,” Singh told the large gathering. Singh said that once Pakistan stops sponsoring terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, India will initiate dialogue. He also highlighted that 85 percent of those killed by terrorism in the region were Muslims, stressing the extensive impact of violence on local communities. Referring to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), Singh urged its residents to consider joining India, stressing that India sees them as its own, unlike Pakistan, which treats them as foreigners. This statement came during another rally in support of BJP candidate Rakesh Singh Thakur in Ramban. Singh pointed out that there has been a significant improvement in the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir since Article 370 was revoked in August 2019. He noted that the youth now carry laptops and computers instead of pistols, and acts of violence, such as shootings in Srinagar, have sharply declined. He also criticised the National Conference-Congress alliance's promise to restore Article 370, calling it impossible as long as the BJP is in power. Singh reiterated that the BJP's vision is to bring massive development to Jammu and Kashmir, so much so that people in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir would want to join India. Recently, Pakistan’s Additional Solicitor General filed an affidavit stating that PoK is a foreign land. Singh responded by reminding PoK residents that while Pakistan considers them foreigners, India welcomes them as its own. The Defence Minister's campaign visit followed Home Minister Amit Shah's two-day tour, during which he released the BJP's manifesto and held strategic meetings with party leaders. In the Ramban constituency, BJP's Rakesh Singh Thakur is competing against NC's Arjun Singh Raju and rebel candidate Suraj Singh Parihar. Singh expressed confidence that the BJP would form the next government in Jammu and Kashmir with a clear majority, praising the region's skilled, hardworking, and dedicated people. He added that with the BJP in power, Jammu and Kashmir could become a modern, leading state in India. Recalling his time as Home Minister, Singh spoke about efforts to normalise the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir when Mehbooba Mufti was Chief Minister. He mentioned a parliamentary delegation's failed attempt to engage with the Hurriyat Conference for peace talks, pointing to the resistance from Hurriyat leaders. Singh also rebuked the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and National Conference (NC) for predicting that the revocation of Article 370 would lead to chaos. “We took bold action, and nothing happened,” he asserted. Highlighting the BJP's achievements, Singh mentioned how the rights of women, marginalized groups, and Pakistani refugees have been safeguarded under the current government. He also emphasized the transformation of Kashmir into a tourism hotspot, largely driven by infrastructure projects such as improved road and rail connectivity. In a final note, Singh took a jab at NC Vice President Omar Abdullah’s reported remarks on the hanging of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru. “What should have been done with him? If not hanged, should he have been garlanded?” he asked.

"Operation Bhedia: Vengeance likely reason behind wolf attacks in UP's Bahraich, say officials",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/operation-bhedia-vengeance-likely-reason-behind-wolf-attacks-in-ups-bahraich-say-officials-12817053.html,general," September 08, 2024 / 18:42   ","An invasion of wolves is keeping the forest authorities on their toes in Bahraich, where the animal is suspected to have killed at least six people and wounded several, all within a very short span. The Uttar Pradesh forest department has so far trapped four wolves, but the animal attacks have continued despite multiple teams casting a dragnet across a 75 square kilometre area in the district near Nepal border. There is only a studied speculation about what has suddenly made wolves so aggressive that they have begun invading human settlements, terrorising 15,000 people from 50 villages of Mahsi tehsil of Bahraich. ”The aggressive behaviour of wolves is not normal. Rabies infection increases the aggression of wolves and thus this possibility of them being infected is there,” a forest officer told PTI. ”It is necessary that medical tests be conducted on four of the estimated six wolves caught so far, so that it can be ascertained whether they are infected with rabies,” he said. Dr AM Pawde, Principal Scientist and in-charge at the Wildlife Centre of the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), Bareilly, said there is a possibility wolves alone may not be behind all the attacks. Honey badgers, known as ’kabra bijju’ in local parlance, too might have been behind some of the attacks, he said. ”The nature of attack on at least one of the eight victims suggested a pattern different from what is left behind by wolves, who usually attack their prey from the toe or target a vein at the back of the leg,” Pawde said. ”But one of the Bahraich victims, a girl, had some part of her nose eaten away,” he said. Pawde gave his logic why wolves may have suddenly begun attacking humans. ”Wolves have a tendency to extract revenge. The Bahraich case seems to be a case of both revenge as well as growing human encroachment in wildlife forest space,” he said. ”Wolves are extremely sensitive. The teams working on the field are now looking at the possibility of one of the wolves being lame, a possible consequence of it being assaulted by humans for venturing into their area in the past. ”This wolf could be the alpha wolf, the leader of the pack. This theory lends credibility to the theory about a pack of wolves being loyal to the one who was assaulted in the past and who are now targeting the human population in the vicinity,” Pawde said. ”The other possibility is that wolves became aggressive after watching some people cause harm to their pups,” he said. According to sources in the forest department, ’Operation Bhedia’, launched on July 17, has led to the capture of four out of the estimated six wolves possibly behind the attacks. The last capture was made on the morning of August 29. Since then, two more incidents of wild animals attacking humans have been recorded. Wildlife experts believe wolves are responsible for at least six of the total eight deaths so far in violent animal attacks. At least 20 people have been seriously injured, of which about 12 to 15 are believed to be injured in wolf attacks. Bahraich Divisional Forest Officer Ajit Pratap Singh said several teams, comprising 165 members in all, are engaged in wolf-hunting. The state government has deployed nine shooters also. ”The affected areas have been divided into various categories in terms of their vulnerability and in each area is manned with two officers of the level of Divisional Forest Officer or Sub-Divisional Forest Officer. There are six teams of five members in each category,” he said. Rumourmongering is not helping the forest department either. ”Every evening, the forest department receives information about the presence of wolves at different places and all these tip-offs prove to be fake. These days anyone getting injured is saying that injury was inflicted by a wild animal,” he said. District Magistrate of Bahraich Monica Rani said the local administration is also installing doors in the houses of people who live in affected areas. ”So far doors have been installed in 120 houses in villages like Kolela, Sisayya Churamani, Sikandarpur and Nakwa,” she said. Rani said shelter homes have been established in Panchayat Bhawan Agraura Dubaha, Raipur, and Chandpaiya and Samvilian Vidyalaya Sisayya Chunamani. District Panchayati Raj Officer Raghavendra Dwivedi, the nodal officer nominated for the shelter homes said these shelters are set up for the destitute or those who don’t have proper houses in the affected regions.

"US presidential debates over the years: Gaffes, chaos, scandals",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/donald-trump-kamala-harris-tied-on-eve-of-televised-presidential-debate-12817128.html,general," September 08, 2024 / 20:49   ","From Gerald Ford's catastrophic Soviet gaffe to Ronald Reagan's witty remark about his age and Joe Biden's infamous implosion, US presidential debates have featured jaw-dropping moments. Here are some of the most memorable in modern US politics. - Kennedy-Nixon, September 26, 1960 -It was the first televised debate of its kind, when broadcasts were in black-and-white, and it established the importance of a politician's public image. Republican Richard Nixon looked poised to win the election, having served two terms as vice president under Dwight Eisenhower. But the debate did not go well for him. Nixon refused to wear makeup and appeared pale and sweaty in front of more than 66 million viewers, while young Massachusetts senator John F. Kennedy looked tanned and relaxed. While Nixon addressed the moderator, Kennedy looked at the camera, speaking directly to his voters. How much the debate visuals pushed the needle is disputed, but Kennedy went on to defeat Nixon at the polls. - Ford-Carter, October 6, 1976 -The first debate between Republican president Gerald Ford and Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter was marked by a 27-minute loss of audio. The second debate didn't go well for Ford either, when he made a gaffe that arguably cost him the presidency. At the height of the Cold War, Ford uttered that ""there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration,"" even though the Soviet Union had troops deployed across the Eastern bloc. Six days passed before Ford explained himself, saying he spoke not of the literal military presence but meant that people's spirits there hadn't been crushed. - Reagan-Mondale, October 21, 1984 -Republican president Ronald Reagan was 73 when he ran for a second term against 56-year-old Walter Mondale. But he turned his age into his strength with a witty answer that went down in history. ""I will not make age an issue of this campaign,"" Reagan said when asked whether he was fit for office. ""I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience."" - Bush-Clinton-Perot, October 15, 1992 -The second presidential debate in the 1992 race pitted incumbent president George Bush against both his future successor Bill Clinton and Ross Perot, an independent candidate. Bush was caught on camera looking at his watch while Clinton talked to an audience member during a town hall debate, a move that cost Bush dearly. Years later, Bush admitted he hated debates. ""Maybe that's why I was looking at it -- 'Only 10 more minutes of this crap.'"" - Obama-Romney, October 22, 2012 -During a debate against president Barack Obama, Republican challenger Mitt Romney lamented that the US Navy had fewer ships presently than it did in 1916. ""Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed,"" Obama retorted. ""We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go under water, nuclear submarines."" Obama's comments went viral. - Trump-Clinton, October 9, 2016 -The second debate of the 2016 US presidential election pitting Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was particularly vicious. Coming shortly after the release of a video in which Trump was heard boasting that his fame allowed him to grope women, the Republican billionaire went after his opponent's husband, former president Bill Clinton, accusing him of being ""so abusive to women."" Trump also vowed to have Hillary Clinton investigated over her use of a private email account when she was secretary of state. ""It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,"" Clinton said. Trump shot back: ""Because you'd be in jail."" - Trump-Biden, September 29, 2020 -The first debate of the 2020 presidential election, featuring Trump and Democrat Joe Biden, devolved into shouting and insults. With Trump constantly interrupting him, Biden snapped, saying, ""Will you shut up, man?"" The Democrat also called his opponent a ""clown"" and ""Putin's puppy."" Trump for his part kept evading the question of whether he would recognize the results of the election. Powerless to control the two candidates, the debate moderator, Fox News journalist Chris Wallace, later described feeling ""desperation."" - Trump-Biden, June 27, 2024 -Organized an unprecedented four months ahead of this year's November vote, the June debate was supposed to give Biden, 81, a chance to shore up concerns about his age. But it was a debacle for the Democrat, who repeatedly lost his train of thought, stared blankly and spoke at times incoherently and with a raspy voice. The dismal performance set the stage for Biden to eventually drop out of the race -- passing the torch to Trump's new challenger, Vice President Kamala Harris.

Rishabh Pant makes aÂ comebackÂ to the red-ball setup for the first time after his fatal car accident, while Virat Kohli, who had skipped the home Test series against England earlier this year, also returns to the fold. Pant's previous Test appearance was also against Bangladesh, which was at Mirpur from December 22-25, 2022. Almost a week later on December 30, the southpaw met with a fatal car accident before making his return to top flight cricket only in the IPL this year.

The rap megastar, who has won 17 Grammys, said he’s looking forward to bringing hip-hop to the NFL's championship game, where he performed as a guest artist with Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg in 2022. “Rap music is still the most impactful genre to date,"" Lamar said in a statement.

This is the second time in less than a month that NCP leader Pawar publicly admitted he had made a mistake by fielding his wife against NCP (SP) leader Sule, the daughter of his uncle Sharad Pawar, and noted politics should not enter the home. The ""admission"" of mistake came against the backdrop of poor performance by the NCP, one of the constituents of the Mahayuti alliance in the state, in its maiden general elections after a split in the party. Addressing the Jansamman rally organised by the NCP in Gadchiroli city on Friday, Ajit Pawar tried to discourage party leader and state minister Dharmarao Baba Aatram's daughter Bhagyashri from crossing over to the Sharad Pawar-led NCP (SP). Speculation is going around about a potential contest between Bhagyashri and her father in the upcoming state assembly elections. ""Nobody loves a daughter more than her father. Despite giving her away in marriage in Belgaum, he (Aatram) stood by her in Gadchiroli and made her the president of Zilla Parishad. Now you (Bhagyashri) are set to fight against your own father. Is this right?"" the deputy CM asked the gathering. ""You should support your father and help him win because only he has the capacity and determination to develop the region. The society never accepts breaking one's own family,"" he said. This is like breaking the family, Ajit Pawar said, referring to the rift between Bhagyashri and her father over her political move. ""Society doesn't like this. I have experienced the same and accepted my mistake,"" he said. The NCP led by Ajit Pawar suffered a severe drubbing in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, losing three of the four constituencies, including Baramati, it had contested. In contrast, the Sharad Pawar-led faction won eight out of the 10 seats it contested. Aatram, an MLA from Aheri in Gadchiroli district, has sided with Ajit Pawar. ""Aatram's daughter learnt politics from her father. Aatram was a 'vastad' (master) in politics who always kept one move close to his chest and played it at the appropriate time. Like the vastad, Aatram too doesn't teach everything to his pupil,""Ajit Pawar quipped. With PTI inputs ",NEGATIVE

Surpassing the best-ever tally of 19 medals in Tokyo in 2021, and exceeding expectations of 25 this time, India claimed 29 podium finishes, including seven gold medals. There were nine silver and 13 bronze medals to go with those. This is significant. A country aspiring to get closer to the highest of standards in sports has to look for overall development. A few medals in the Olympics may not be enough in that pursuit. Developing the para-sports is a part of this process and it was seen in Paris that India is on the right track as far as this segment is concerned. CHECKÂ | Paralympics Medal Tally 2024: Complete list of Indians who secured podium finish at Paris There were signs of consistency and sustained perseverance in the achievements of several medallists. If 17-year old archer Sheetal Devi became Indiaâ€™s youngest-ever medallist at the Paralympics, 29-year-old high-jumper Mariyappan Thangavelu achieved the unique feat of securing medals in three successive editions of the Games. A first woman track-and-field medallist in Preethi Pal, a maiden archery podium-topper in Harvinder Singh â€” there were multiple firsts as well. Shooter Avani Lekhara defending her gold medal was another highlight in a campaign full of memorable moments. India had finished 71st at the Paris Olympics with six medals. In the Paralympics, the position was 18th. What does it mean? Difficult to say, because these two competitions are vastly different. What it does show is that a lot of effort is being done at both levels to lift the standards. That is significant. This attempt to grow para-sports is an indicator of a cultural change when it comes to sports. It reflects a change in attitude, a mindset of inclusivity. EXPLAINED | What is the flag controversy that saw Navdeep Singh win Paralympics gold despite finishing second If this continues, more medals will follow, in the Olympics as well as Paralympics. The latter is significant because it conveys how a country looks at sports or treats its athletes. The Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) deserves credit for being able to secure grants from the sports ministry and attract corporate sponsorship. There was a lot of money spent on the preparation and the number of medals won justifies that expenditure. It also tells a tale of a willingness to grow. Just to illustrate the point: In the Olympics, the first three positions were secured by the USA, China and Japan. Great Britain was seventh. In the Paralympics, itâ€™s China on top, followed by Great Britain and the USA. Japan are 10th. It shows that countries that do well sports, do it in all segments.

At the end, Iran's Sadegh Beit Sayah's pain proved to be India’s Navdeep Singh's gain. Navdeep's silver was upgraded to gold after Sayah was disqualified for “improper conduct”. The latter had initially won the gold medal. What event did Navdeep Singh took part in? Navdeep won India's first-ever gold medal in the men's javelin F41 category. He finished fourth at the Tokyo Games three years ago. On Saturday, the 23-year-old from Haryana threw 47.32m to win the gold. In the process, he also upstaged world record holder Sun Pengxiang of China. But why was Sayah, who finished above the Indian, disqualified?  The para-athlete from Iran breached Rule 8.1 of the International Paralympic Committee Code of Conduct that deals with ""unsporting and improper conduct”. After winning the medal, Sayah was seen celebrating with a flag that was of religious nature. He also entered the field of play. “As per the rule, athletes can only celebrate with their national flags,” Satyanarayana Shimoga, the head coach of the Indian para-athletics contingent, was quoted as saying by RevSportz. “He (Sayah) also entered the field of play, which was prohibited.” Did Iran protest against the disqualification? The Iranian contingent protested, but it was overruled. How did Navdeep perform in the event? Coming back to Navdeep, his first throw was a foul. But he showed character and came back with his personal best. Later, Navdeep spoke about how it was important to stay calm after the first throw was a foul. How was Navdeep introduced to javelin? Navdeep competes in a classification that is for the athletes of short stature. Back in his village in Haryana, he had to face insults for dwarfism when he was growing up. Sport was his only solace. Wrestling was his first love, but a back injury in 2011 forced him to give up the sport. He took to running. Javelin came to him late, in 2017. Neeraj Chopra was an inspiration. Navdeep read about Neeraj's gold medal at the 2016 IAAF U20 World Championship in the newspaper and decided to take up the sport seriously. Podium finishes had been eluding Navdeep in the international events of late. But he rose to the occasion when it mattered most. No wonder that Devendra Jhajharia, the current president of the Paralympic Committee of India, hailed Navdeep’s performance. In exclusive arrangement with RevSportz ",NEGATIVE

The statement follows months of discussions between Trump and his economic advisers on ways to penalize allies or adversaries who seek active ways to engage in bilateral trade in currencies other than the dollar. Options have included export controls, currency manipulation charges and tariffs, people familiar with the matter have previously told Bloomberg News. Trump, who has long embraced protectionist trade policies, said the dollar has been “under major siege” for eight years. China, India, Brazil, Russia and South Africa discussed de-dollarization at a summit last year. By contrast, Trump has said he wants the dollar to remain the world’s reserve currency, a pledge he renewed at Saturday’s rally. While dollar dominance has lessened in recent decades, the US currency still accounted for 59% of official foreign-exchange reserves in the first quarter of 2024, with the euro second at almost 20%, according to the International Monetary Fund. Wisconsin is one of the most critical swing states in the race between Trump and Democratic rival Kamala Harris. The two are fighting for the support of the state’s working-class voters, uneasy with President Joe Biden’s economic agenda and drawn to Trump’s populist appeals. A Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll released last week showed Harris leading in Wisconsin by 8 percentage points, the largest lead over Trump she has among the seven battleground states in the poll. Trump’s Wisconsin rally caps off a campaign swing that included Pennsylvania and North Carolina, as well as a stop in his hometown of New York City where he delivered an economy-focused address and held a press conference. Harris spent Saturday in Pennsylvania preparing for a Tuesday debate with Trump, the next big test that could change the course of the close race.

Kolkata doctor's rape and murder incident: Supreme Court to resume hearing on September 9,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/12817047-12817047.html,general," September 08, 2024 / 18:54   ","The Supreme Court is set to hear on September 9 the case concerning the murder and alleged rape of a doctor at the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata. The hearing will take place before a bench comprising Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud and Justices J.B. Pardiwala and Manoj Misra. The case has garnered significant attention as it was initiated by the Supreme Court taking suo motu congisnace of the incident. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs has recently filed an application with the Supreme Court, accusing the West Bengal government of ""unpardonable"" non-cooperation in providing logistical support to the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which has been assigned to secure the hospital. The Ministry's application characterizes the alleged non-cooperation by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government as indicative of a broader systemic issue and has called for a directive requiring state authorities to fully cooperate with the CISF. The Centre has also requested that the apex court initiate contempt proceedings against state officials for ""wilful non-compliance"" of court orders if the situation is not addressed. During a previous hearing on August 22, the Supreme Court criticized the Kolkata Police for their delay in registering the case of the doctor's unnatural death.Â  On August 20, the Court had condemned the rape and murder as ""horrific"" and issued several directives, including the formation of a 10-member National Task Force to develop protocols for safeguarding doctors and healthcare professionals. The Court urged protesting doctors nationwide to resume work, emphasizing that ""justice and medicine"" should not be halted. It further assured that all necessary measures would be taken to ensure their safety. The tragic murder and alleged rape of the doctor, whose body was found with severe injury marks inside a seminar hall at the state-run hospital on August 9, sparked nationwide protests. A civic volunteer Sanjay Roy was arrested by the Kolkata Police in connection with the case the following day. On August 13, the Calcutta High Court transferred the investigation from the Kolkata Police to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which began its probe on August 14.

The government has been “very concerned” about an influx of cruise passengers during certain months of the year and will begin charging fees, Mitsotakis said Saturday during his annual speech at the Thessaloniki International Fair. It will also increase a tax related to the climate-crisis on accommodation. Greece received a record 36.1 million visitors in 2023, while arrivals rose 16% to 11.6 million in the first half of 2024, according to the latest data from the Bank of Greece. The tourism sector contributes about 20% to the economy, making it vital to the health of the nation. The country will also expand its so-called “Golden Visa” program to investors who are willing to put at least €250,000 ($277,000) into local startups. Foreigners were previously required to buy property to acquire the visa. All passengers arriving at Greek ports will pay a fee, and the charge will be greater in the popular tourism islands of Santorini and Mykonos. A lodging tax for the April-to-October period also will be increased, with revenue benefiting local communities. Mitsotakis reiterated concern that parts of Greece face the problem of “overtourism.” In an interview with Bloomberg in June, he announced plans to restrict cruise ships visiting the country’s most popular islands from 2025. Short-term rentals have been blamed for fueling the country’s housing crisis, which along with high consumer prices has been at the center of recent political debate. The government will ban any new short-term leasing for at least one year in three main parts of Athens, Mitsotakis said. Property owners who change leases from short-term to long-term won’t have to pay rental tax for three years, as will owners who decide to rent their homes instead of keeping them off the market, he said. Holiday rentals increased an annual average of 28% from 2019 to 2023, while available short-term rentals doubled in the same period. Meanwhile, hotel accommodation rose just 3.5% in that period, according to data published in a Grant Thornton report for the country’s Chamber of Hotels released this week.

More Measures Mitsotakis on Saturday also revealed a number of measures aimed at easing the cost of living, including a reduction in social insurance contributions by 1 percentage point in 2025 instead of a previous plan for a 0.5 point cut. The premier also announced, among others: -A 2.2%-to-2.5% increase in around 2 million pensions from Jan. 1.-An increase in minimum wages beginning in April-An increase in public sector wages, especially to doctors, firefighters and workers in the army and policy forces.-Various tax reliefs to help the self-employed, farmers and others-Changes to unemployment benefits “I don’t have a sack of reckless spending today,” he said. “Our spending for 2025 is well balanced.” Greece has already pledged to meet a budget primary surplus — an index that shows revenue minus spending excluding interest payments — of 2.1% of GDP for both 2024 and 2025, up from 1.9% in 2023. Fiscal discipline is one of the most important criteria for financial markets, and the country’s recent prudent budget path was one of the drivers for ratings companies to return Greece to the investment grade zone in 2023 after 13 years at junk status. “Healthy and rising primary surpluses, in tandem with sound nominal growth, will facilitate further significant reduction in the public debt-to-GDP, which is expected to fall to below 140% by 2027, from 161.9% in 2023,” DBRS Morningstar said Friday.

""Out of 5,630,000 voters recorded, 5,320,000 voted for the independent candidate Abdelmadjid Tebboune, accounting for 94.65 percent of the vote,"" ANIE head Mohamed Charfi told reporters in the capital Algiers. Tebboune, 78, was heavily favoured to secure a second term in the race against moderate Islamist Abdelaali Hassani, 57, and socialist candidate Youcef Aouchiche, 41. ""The election was marked by broad transparency"" and ""reflected the electoral maturity of the people"", said Charfi. But he did not provide the official turnout rate, which was seen as Tebboune's major challenge in a vote where his victory was all but certain. The re-elected president had hoped for a higher turnout than in 2019, the year he was elected amid widely boycotted elections and the Hirak mass pro-democracy protests. Tebboune was elected at the time amid a record abstention rate of over 60 percent. In the early hours of the day, ANIE had announced an ""average turnout"" rate of 48 percent, calling it ""provisional"", but it did not give a breakdown of the number of voters against those initially registered. The announcement came three hours behind schedule after the authority said on Saturday evening that it was extending voting by one hour, expecting more voters to show up. ANIE had also announced an ""average"" participation of 26 percent by 5:00 pm (1600 GMT) -- which would have compared to 33 percent by that time of day in the 2019 elections. Hassani's campaign on Sunday said in a statement that ANIE's provisional turnout was ""strange"" and denounced attempts to ""inflate the results"". Hassani heads the moderate Islamist party the Movement of Society for Peace and Aouchiche the centre-left Socialist Forces Front.

Yunus, 84, made the remarks while responding to a question at a meeting with students who had participated in the student-people revolution that ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina last month, state-run BSS news agency reported.”We need to maintain good relations with India. But it should be based on equity and fairness,” the chief adviser’s special assistant Mahfuj Alam quoted him as saying. Mahfuj, who briefed the media after the meeting, added that the chief adviser said Bangladesh always gives importance to mutual respect and equity in maintaining relations with neighbours.He stressed reviving the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to enhance regional cooperation.The interim government headed by Yunus was appointed days after Hasina resigned and fled to India on August 5 following unprecedented anti-government student-led protests over a controversial quota system in government jobs.

"Trump, Harris tied on eve of televised presidential debate",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/trump-harris-tied-on-eve-of-televised-presidential-debate-12817109.html,World," September 08, 2024 / 20:26   ","The US presidential race remains neck-and-neck according to polls released Sunday, two days before Kamala Harris and Donald Trump hold their first -- and potentially only -- televised debate. The latest polling confirms that Trump retains locked-in support from about half of voters, despite the Republican's historic status as a convicted felon and his role in instigating the unprecedented attempt to overturn his 2020 loss to Joe Biden. Harris, who only jumped into the race after President Biden abruptly quit in July, has rapidly transformed herself from a little-noticed vice president into a serious contender. However, the polls show she has not made a major breakthrough, leaving the race a toss-up. A New York Times/Siena poll found that 78-year-old Trump is leading Harris nationally by 48 to 47 percent, well within the margin of error. US presidential elections are decided by tallying the results of state-by-state contests, rather than an overall national popular vote, meaning that a tiny handful of swing states typically decide the balance. The poll found Harris, 59, narrowly ahead in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania and tied in four other swing states -- Nevada, Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona. A CBS News/YouGov poll put Harris ahead by one percentage point in Michigan and Wisconsin and tied in Pennsylvania. The election is already chaotic, with 81-year-old Biden dropping out amid concerns over his age, Trump narrowly surviving an assassin's bullet at a rally, and fears mounting that Trump will again refuse to concede if he loses in November. However, the latest numbers confirm that each candidate retains a remarkably stable base of loyalists, almost evenly splitting the country. One game changer could be Tuesday's ABC News debate, the only one scheduled between the two. Trump will be under pressure to rein in his characteristic use of insults and intimidation as he stands next to a mixed-race candidate vying to become the first female president in US history. Harris will need to use the huge viewership to connect with Americans in a way that she was unable to as vice president and has had little time to accomplish in her super-condensed campaign run. With Trump now the oldest presidential nominee in US history, she is pitching an optimistic, forward-looking message in contrast to Trump's apocalyptic claims that the country faces terminal decline without him in the White House. - Sexist taunts - At the same time, Harris will have to solve the conundrum of how to debate Trump, who habitually makes false statements on nearly every topic and loves to get under his opponents' skin. Biden, in his only debate against Trump before dropping his candidacy, found himself entirely unable to cope. Already, Trump has been subjecting Harris in his speeches to racist and sexist taunts, deliberately mispronouncing her name and calling her ""crazy"" and a ""Marxist."" ""It will take almost superhuman focus and discipline to deal with Donald Trump in a debate,"" Harris supporter and current transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg told CNN. The Harris campaign announced it would ""barnstorm battleground states"" after the debate, beginning in North Carolina, then Pennsylvania. Trump held a rally in Wisconsin on Saturday where he appealed to his mostly white, working class base with a dark speech claiming that he is struggling against a ""rogue regime"" where Democrats ""imported murderers, child predators and serial rapists from all over the planet."" On his Truth Social platform, he warned that once back in the White House he would impose ""long prison sentences"" on all those he said were planning ""cheating"" in November.

Here are some of the most memorable in modern US politics. - Kennedy-Nixon, September 26, 1960 -It was the first televised debate of its kind, when broadcasts were in black-and-white, and it established the importance of a politician's public image. Republican Richard Nixon looked poised to win the election, having served two terms as vice president under Dwight Eisenhower. But the debate did not go well for him. Nixon refused to wear makeup and appeared pale and sweaty in front of more than 66 million viewers, while young Massachusetts senator John F. Kennedy looked tanned and relaxed. While Nixon addressed the moderator, Kennedy looked at the camera, speaking directly to his voters. How much the debate visuals pushed the needle is disputed, but Kennedy went on to defeat Nixon at the polls. - Ford-Carter, October 6, 1976 -The first debate between Republican president Gerald Ford and Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter was marked by a 27-minute loss of audio. The second debate didn't go well for Ford either, when he made a gaffe that arguably cost him the presidency. At the height of the Cold War, Ford uttered that ""there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration,"" even though the Soviet Union had troops deployed across the Eastern bloc. Six days passed before Ford explained himself, saying he spoke not of the literal military presence but meant that people's spirits there hadn't been crushed. - Reagan-Mondale, October 21, 1984 -Republican president Ronald Reagan was 73 when he ran for a second term against 56-year-old Walter Mondale. But he turned his age into his strength with a witty answer that went down in history. ""I will not make age an issue of this campaign,"" Reagan said when asked whether he was fit for office. ""I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience."" - Bush-Clinton-Perot, October 15, 1992 -The second presidential debate in the 1992 race pitted incumbent president George Bush against both his future successor Bill Clinton and Ross Perot, an independent candidate. Bush was caught on camera looking at his watch while Clinton talked to an audience member during a town hall debate, a move that cost Bush dearly. Years later, Bush admitted he hated debates. ""Maybe that's why I was looking at it -- 'Only 10 more minutes of this crap.'"" - Obama-Romney, October 22, 2012 -During a debate against president Barack Obama, Republican challenger Mitt Romney lamented that the US Navy had fewer ships presently than it did in 1916. ""Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed,"" Obama retorted. ""We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go under water, nuclear submarines."" Obama's comments went viral. - Trump-Clinton, October 9, 2016 -The second debate of the 2016 US presidential election pitting Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was particularly vicious. Coming shortly after the release of a video in which Trump was heard boasting that his fame allowed him to grope women, the Republican billionaire went after his opponent's husband, former president Bill Clinton, accusing him of being ""so abusive to women."" Trump also vowed to have Hillary Clinton investigated over her use of a private email account when she was secretary of state. ""It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,"" Clinton said. Trump shot back: ""Because you'd be in jail."" - Trump-Biden, September 29, 2020 -The first debate of the 2020 presidential election, featuring Trump and Democrat Joe Biden, devolved into shouting and insults. With Trump constantly interrupting him, Biden snapped, saying, ""Will you shut up, man?"" The Democrat also called his opponent a ""clown"" and ""Putin's puppy."" Trump for his part kept evading the question of whether he would recognize the results of the election. Powerless to control the two candidates, the debate moderator, Fox News journalist Chris Wallace, later described feeling ""desperation."" - Trump-Biden, June 27, 2024 -Organized an unprecedented four months ahead of this year's November vote, the June debate was supposed to give Biden, 81, a chance to shore up concerns about his age. But it was a debacle for the Democrat, who repeatedly lost his train of thought, stared blankly and spoke at times incoherently and with a raspy voice. The dismal performance set the stage for Biden to eventually drop out of the race -- passing the torch to Trump's new challenger, Vice President Kamala Harris.

The 71-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party held a rally in Islamabad Sunday to press for his release from jail. Khan was arrested on August 5 last year after his conviction in the first Toshakhana corruption case filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan. Since then, he has been in jail in different cases.The government ministers say Khan’s freedom is linked with his unconditional apology for the riots in which the PTI workers allegedly attacked state and military installations. Khan, however, demands the setting up of a judicial commission for a probe into the May 9 violence.“Today, Imran Khan completed 400 days in jail, but the powers that be couldn’t break his resolve for Haqiqi Azadi. The whole nation is standing behind him and he will soon come out of jail,” PTI's senior leader Asghar Gujjar said on Sunday.Gujjar told PTI that today’s landmark rally in Islamabad will be an eye-opener for this “fake government” of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) which could no longer detain Khan.Last week in a talk with journalists during a court hearing in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, Khan said that he will ""remain in jail for my whole life but not strike a deal for my freedom. I will not compromise on the struggle for Haqiqi Azadi.” A few days ago, Khan on his X account wrote about the deplorable conditions he is kept in the prison. He said he is kept in solitary confinement as he spends 21 hours of the day inside his prison cell.“My cell heats up like an oven because of the weather, but I have never complained, never said I’m suffering. I have to go to a separate room to bathe. I have just one complaint, though. I am not allowed to speak with my children, although that is my legal right. They (the illicit government) lie on the floor of Parliament that I have been given five-star facilities. I have the same facilities that an inmate on death row has,” Khan said.He said it feels as though a Martial Law administrator is in charge. “I have not spent a single day at the prison hospital. Nawaz Sharif, Shehbaz Sharif and Asif Zardari were given air-conditioned rooms with en-suite bathrooms. One of the prisoners cooks for me, but I have never complained,"" he said.""Only three visitors are allowed to meet me in a week, whereas Nawaz Sharif met with 40 people (when he was in jail). It was an open house for him. Nawaz Sharif used to even talk to journalists in the privacy of his room. I send the names of six of my party leaders every week, and only three are allowed to meet me for a mere 30 minutes. I have so many cases against me and yet, I am only allowed to meet with six lawyers,” he added.

Following unprecedented anti-government protests that peaked on August 5, Hasina resigned as prime minister and fled to India. Necessary steps will be taken to bring former prime minister Hasina back under the extradition treaty with India to try her on charges of mass killings during the student-led protests in July and August, International Crimes Tribunal Chief Prosecutor Md Tajul Islam was quoted as saying by The Daily Star newspaper. ""We will file an application with the International Crimes Tribunal, when it resumes functions, to issue arrest warrants against all the absconding accused including Sheikh Hasina in connection with the cases filed for mass killing and crimes against humanity,"" he said at a press briefing on the ICT premises in Dhaka. Replying to a question, he said a decision would be taken after consulting with the government about amendments to the existing International Crimes Tribunal Act for holding trial of the new cases filed with IT. ""Information, documents and evidence against the accused persons will have to be collected from across the country and those will have to be compiled, examined and placed properly before the tribunal, which is very much challenging and huge task,"" Islam added. According to the interim government's Health Adviser Nurjahan Begum, more than 1,000 people have been killed and hundreds injured during the protests against the Hasina-led government. Bangladeshâ€™s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) last month launched an investigation against Hasina and nine others on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity that took place from July 15 to August 5 during the studentsâ€™ mass movement. Islam said the International Crimes Tribunal and its investigation team will have to be reconstituted by appointing new judges and investigators as previous judges, prosecution team and investigation agency appointed by the previous government have stepped down after the interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus was formed in the country following the fall of the Hasina-led government.

Pope Francis to use handmade chairs by Indian-origin carpenter during Singapore visit,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/pope-francis-to-use-handmade-chairs-by-indian-origin-carpenter-during-singapore-visit-12817039.html,World," September 08, 2024 / 17:43   ","During his visit to Singapore next week, Pope Francis will use two handmade chairs crafted by an Indian-origin carpenter here for his inter-religious dialogue sessions. The chairs are made by 44-year-old Govindharaj Muthiah, who took his passion for woodworking full-time in 2019, according to a Channel News Asia report last week. Muthiah said when he received the fortuitous call from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore around end-July, he did not expect to be presented with the coolest addition to his CV to date. Even though he completed both ""100 per cent handmade"" chairs within a whirlwind month, Muthiah said the news of being assigned to do the chairs still had not sunk in. “When I got the call, the first question was: ‘Hi, we knew you do furniture. We were introduced by someone.’ And they asked if I could make a chair. I was like, ‘Okay, do you have the dimensions? I’ll work on it,’” he told CNA. “Then (the caller) said, ‘No it’s more than that, there’s a lot of specific details.’ And I said, ‘Okay, send me the drawing.’ Usually what I tell customers is, if you can draw it and show me, I will build it for you. So likewise, I said that, thinking he’s on the same page. He paused for a while and said, ‘It’s for the Pope.’ I was like, ‘Sorry? Who?’ He (repeated himself): ‘For the Pope',” Muthiah recalled. Pope Francis will be in the city-state from Sep 11 to 13, in the last leg of his 12-day four-nation Asia-Pacific tour to Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste, and Singapore. It is his longest trip away from the Vatican since he became head of the worldwide Catholic Church in 2013. In Singapore, the 87-year-old Pope's itinerary includes meeting President Tharman Shanmugaratnam and Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, presiding over mass at the National Stadium, and holding an interreligious dialogue session with youth at Catholic Junior College. The chairs will be used during the interreligious dialogue. So, it is perhaps fitting that Muthiah, a practising Hindu, approached temples and mosques that had just undergone renovation for leftover lumber he could repurpose. Muthiah said when he eventually put pencil to paper, he wanted the final design to be “very vintage”, inspired by furniture from the 18th century. A ""normal chair"" was a no-go. The headboard of one chair was inspired by the distinctive frontage of the old Novena Church here, also known as Church of St Alphonsus. The base of the other chair was inspired by the facade of Basilica of San José de Flores, a catholic church located in Pope Francis’ birthplace of Buenos Aires, Argentina. This chair also has a B-shaped armrest – an homage to Pope Francis’ family name, Bergoglio. And while Pope Francis has a tight schedule, Muthiah is keeping his fingers crossed that he gets to meet the man himself. He said should he get the chance, he plans to present the Pope with a miniature model of the chair.

A walkout would add to the headwinds facing Boeing, which is hurtling toward a sixth straight money-losing year and just hired a new CEO to turn things around. The regional branch of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers says the two sides are far apart on wages, health care and job security. The union of started out seeking pay raises of more than 40% over three years, although ""that's probably not where we're going to end up,” IAM District 751 President Jon Holden said last week. The union has scheduled a two-part election for Thursday, with voting at more than a half-dozen locations in Washington state and one in Southern California. Workers will vote on Boeing's last contract offer and whether to authorize a strike if the offer is rejected. A walkout could begin by Friday morning. A straw vote in July to gauge support for a strike passed with 99.99% support, according to the union. ""What we are asking for is reasonable,” Holden said in an interview. “We need to get more wages to address the very low increases over the last 10 years, massive inflation, massive cost-shift on health care. We are trying to reach an agreement, but (union members) are ready to take action if we don't get there.” Holden said the union has a strike fund in the millions and isn't afraid to tap it. Boeing declined to make an executive available to discuss the labour negotiations. A spokesperson provided a one-sentence statement. “We're confident we can reach a deal that balances the needs of our employees and the business realities we face as a company,” the statement said. Boeing's new chief executive, Kelly Ortberg, has tried to take a conciliatory posture toward labour. He is working in Seattle, to be near the factories where the company builds most of its commercial airplanes, instead of at headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. He walked the floor of the 737 Max plant during his first day on the job. “He understands that they are basically contentious relationships with the union, and he wants to make those relationships better,” TD Cowen aerospace analyst Cai von Rumohr said. Ortberg already has a long to-do list. The new CEO will try to fix Boeing's aircraft-manufacturing process, gain regulatory approval for the long-delayed 777X jumbo jet, limit damage from over-budget government contracts, pay down $45 billion in net debt, and absorb Spirit AeroSystems, the money-losing key supplier that Boeing just bought for $4.7 billion. Ortberg's toughest job will be restoring Boeing's reputation for quality, which was crushed after two 737 Max jets crashed less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people, and took another big hit when a door plug blew off a Max during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. Unlike strikes at airlines, which are very rare, a walkout at Boeing would not have an immediate effect on consumers. It would not result in any canceled flights. It would, however, shut down production and leave Boeing with no jets to deliver to the airlines that ordered them. “During a strike, they don't work on planes, they don't deliver planes,” von Rumohr said. Aircraft makers typically get about 60% of the purchase price on delivery, “so not delivering planes has a massive impact on your cash in-flow, and your costs probably continue on.” An eight-week strike in 2008, the longest at Boeing since a 10-week walkout in 1995, cost the company about $100 million a day in deferred revenue. Meeting the union's wage demand would cost Boeing $1.5 billion in cash, which is “a small price to pay versus a strike,” Jefferies aerospace analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu said. In a note to clients, she estimated a strike would cost the company about $3 billion, a calculation based on the impact of the 2008 strike plus inflation and current airplane-production rates. Boeing is in far worse financial shape than it was in 2008. The company has lost $27 billion since the start of 2019, around the time that its best-selling plane, the 737 Max, was grounded worldwide after the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Revenue is down, debt is up. Boeing's greatest strength is that is remains one of the world's two leading manufacturers of airline jets, forming a duopoly with Europe's Airbus. Boeing has a huge backlog of orders, which it values at more than $500 billion. The company's defense and space business is a major government contractor, although that business too is struggling. Its most recent setback was NASA's decision to use SpaceX instead of Boeing's Starliner capsule to bring two astronauts home from the international space station. Job security is emerging as a key issue in the current negotiations. The union is still seething over the loss of work on the 787 Dreamliner, a large, two-aisle jetliner that is assembled by nonunion Boeing workers in South Carolina. The IAM wants a guarantee its members will keep the work they have and that the union will represent the workers who build Boeing's next airliner. That plane isn't even on the drawing board yet, and production could be a decade or more away. It is vital to IAM, however, because one-third of the union's members at Boeing — more than 10,000 people — work on the 737 Max, which the new plane would replace. The union president said Boeing has been in “free fall"" for more than a year, and he acknowledged the company faces huge and costly challenges. Despite all that, he said, the union is in good position to win a strong contract. “All employers are searching for skilled labour, and we have it,” Holden said. “This company has a massive backlog of over 5,000 airplanes to build and deliver, so we are in high demand right now. That's our leverage.”

"Russia's RT will continue to work in the West, editor says",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/russias-rt-will-continue-to-work-in-the-west-editor-says-12817009.html,World," September 08, 2024 / 16:56   ","Russian state media outlet RT, which the United States has accused of trying to influence its presidential election, will continue to work in the West by going around any limits or sanctions, its editor-in-chief said on Sunday. The United States on Wednesday filed money-laundering charges against two employees of RT for what officials said was a scheme to hire an American company to produce online content to influence the 2024 election. The United States also announced actions targeting RT, including Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan, calling her ""a central figure in Russian government malign influence efforts"". Simonyan said on RT that the West had been cracking down on the network since 2014, when Russia unilaterally annexed Crimea, and more strongly since the start of 2022 - when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine - and trying to prevent RT operating as a ""normal journalist organisation"". ""We stayed in those countries, we worked there, and we shall work there - just not now in a straight line,"" Simonyan said. ""We will continue to do that as far as we can - so far it is working out - it's almost like an exquisite gambling thrill."" ""They close entry to us, and we will go through the window, close the window and we will go through the vents and we will see what holes there are in the organism of the United States of America."" US SAYS RT TRYING TO INFLUENCE US ELECTION A senior U.S. intelligence official said RT was using American and other personalities to try to sway U.S. voters into backing Republican presidential nominee and former president Donald Trump over his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris. Russia has since 2022 suppressed almost all remaining independent domestic media, mostly for deviating from the government line on the war in Ukraine, and banned numerous staff at Western news organisations. It has pledged to retaliate against U.S. media for the actions against RT, expanding a growing list of restrictions in both Russia and the West on news outlets from the other side accused of spreading falsehoods. In June, Russia said it was shutting out the broadcasts of 81 media outlets from the European Union in retaliation for a similar EU ban on several Russian media outlets. Simonyan said all U.S. media should be kicked out of Russia and that major U.S.-based social media networks - such as Alphabet's YouTube and Meta's Instagram - should be replaced in Russia because of their influence there. ""We need to make a final, serious leap so that our sites are fully competitive and better, so that they can replace those ones and so that we throw them out of here,"" she said. Simonyan said letting such platforms continue to operate inside Russia was like ""settling a serious enemy army unit here in barracks and taking young people on excursions there, day and night"". Instagram is banned in Russia but can still be accessed using VPN software. YouTube, the most popular foreign video platform in Russia, remains available, though access was noticeably much slower last month. Neither Alphabet nor Meta responded to a request for comment.

"Gunman crosses from Jordan, 3 kills 3 Israeli guards at West Bank border, says Israeli army",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/gunman-crossing-from-jordan-kills-three-israelis-at-border-israeli-army-says-12817007.html,World," September 08, 2024 / 16:07   ","The Israeli military said a truck driver opened fire on Sunday at an Israeli border crossing between the occupied West Bank and Jordan, killing three Israeli guards before being ""eliminated"". The deadly attack at the Allenby Bridge crossing, also known as King Hussein Bridge crossing, comes amid surging violence in the West Bank, with major Israeli military raids and attacks by Palestinians. The military said ""a terrorist"" reached the area of the crossing, in the Jordan Valley, in a truck ""from Jordan"". The driver ""exited the truck and opened fire at Israeli security forces operating at the bridge"", a military statement said. ""Three Israeli civilians were pronounced dead as a result of the attack,"" the military said, later clarifying to AFP that they were ""working as security guards"" and not in the army or police. The attacker was shot dead by forces, the military added. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced the assailant as a ""despicable terrorist"" inspired by ""a murderous ideology"" fuelled by Iran. ""It's a hard day,"" Netanyahu said at the start of a cabinet meeting. ""A despicable terrorist murdered three of our citizens in cold blood at the Allenby Bridge. I send my condolences on behalf of the government."" Jordan's interior ministry said authorities in Amman were ""investigating the incident"", and a Jordanian security source told AFP that the crossing's Jordanian side had been closed. The crossing is the only international gateway for Palestinians from the West Bank that does not require entering Israel, which has occupied the territory since 1967. Private security guards operate the crossing alongside Israeli security forces stationed there. Israel's emergency medical service Magen David Adom said earlier that three people had died of gunshot wounds at the crossing, in what police described as a shooting attack. Israeli media reports said the assailant opened fire at an inspection area. The military said it had deployed soldiers to the scene to ""rule out the suspicion of the truck being rigged with explosives"". Violence in the West Bank has soared since the war in Gaza broke out after Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel. Since the October 7 attack, Israeli troops or settlers have killed at least 662 Palestinians in the West Bank which Israel occupied in 1967, according to the Palestinian health ministry. At least 23 Israelis, including members of the security forces, have been killed in Palestinian attacks during the same period, Israeli officials say.

Trump and Harris battle for Black voters in must-win Georgia,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/trump-and-harris-battle-for-black-voters-in-must-win-georgia-12817005.html,World," September 08, 2024 / 16:01   ","Georgia Vivian Childs, a staunch supporter of Donald Trump, schooled a roomful of Republicans on how to win over Black voters in the battleground state of Georgia. Focus on Trump's economic policies, on illegal immigration and inflation, the Black Baptist minister told the gathered group of volunteers and campaign staff at the former president's newly opened office in the rural city of Valdosta last month. Tell voters what Trump has done for them and that he will bring the change America needs, she exhorted. ""We are the party of hope,"" she said. ""We are the party of truth."" There was a mood of urgency at the office, a grand building with white pillars and porches. By Trump's own admission, Georgia has become a must-win state, one he thought he had locked up until Kamala Harris became his Democratic rival in July. Her late entry ignited a burst of popular enthusiasm, and opinion polls in Georgia show the candidates neck and neck, a huge turnaround from early July when polls showed Trump leading Democratic President Joe Biden by as many as six percentage points. In particular, an intense battle is being waged for the Black voters who make up a third of the state's population, the biggest proportion of Black voters in any of the seven battleground states that will decide the Nov. 5 presidential election. Trump's goal of pulling in more Black support has not only been complicated by Harris' entry, but by Republican-backed voting restrictions that activists say are aimed at putting up barriers to people of color â€“ something the party denies. Childs, part of the national ""Black Americans for Trump"" coalition of advocates, conceded the nomination of Harris initially changed the race in Georgia. ""There was a lot of excitement, absolutely,"" she told Reuters. ""She's Black and a woman."" She insisted that excitement was fading. ""We have got to stop dividing our country based on how we look,"" she added. ""I'm telling people to talk to Black people the same way they talk to white people: look at President Trump's resume, his policies, what he's done for all Americans."" Reuters spoke to three dozen campaign officials, party chairs, local activist groups and allies working on behalf of Trump and Harris to get a sense of each candidate's operation in the closely fought state that Trump lost to Biden by fewer than 12,000 votes in the 2020 election. A senior Trump campaign official, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters, said the team saw particular promise in attracting young Black men who he said have become disaffected with Democrats over high prices and see greater economic opportunities under the former president. PIGS, PEACHES AND POLITICS In churches and county fairs, on doorsteps and social media, and across the airwaves, both campaigns are courting Black people, a voting bloc that has traditionally leaned heavily Democratic but where Trump has been making gains, according to opinion polls. ""It has gotten really intense in Georgia,"" said Essence Johnson, a Black woman who chairs the Democratic Party in Cobb County, a sprawling region outside of Atlanta. Indeed, at the Pig and Peaches barbecue festival in Cobb County, battle lines were drawn. The Democratic stall courted voters of color with literature on student loan forgiveness, help for historically Black universities and lowering drug prices. The Republican stall, a hundred yards away, was replete with Spanish-language leaflets and literature focused on inflation, abortion, economic opportunity and faith. ""A lot of African Americans, Asians and Hispanics have these shared values,"" said Salleigh Grubbs, the Republican county chair, who has been organizing events at schools in the more racially diverse southern part of the county, holding house parties and door knocking in predominately Black neighborhoods. Cobb County illustrates the demographic changes that have transformed Georgia from a reliably Republican state into a battleground. Once a predominately white, Republican county, it's now 30% Black, 14% Hispanic and 6% Asian, an area that helped Biden win Georgia in 2020. Johnson, the Cobb County Democratic chair, said Harris' entry in the race had shifted things dramatically. ""It's a reflection in the mirror for a lot of us,"" she said of Harris. A Black men's forum held just before Biden ended his reelection bid on July 21 drew 14 attendees, she said, but 125 people showed up for another held just after Harris entered the race. Sixty people marked a good crowd at county party meetings when Biden was the candidate; 235 people attended once Harris became the nominee. Before Biden dropped out, Trump's campaign was so confident of victory in Georgia that it had spent less than $3 million on ad buys. Since Harris' emergence, the campaign and an affiliated group responded by sinking more than $30 million into advertising in the state, outspending the Harris campaign through the month of August. Both sides have committed to spending more than $37 million each in Georgia through Election Day, according to AdImpact, a firm that tracks political advertising. The Georgia Black Republican Council, which has endorsed Trump, is launching ads on Black radio stations in eight metro areas, focused on immigration, the economy and opposition to abortion, said Camilla J. Moore, the council's chair. Ads from the Trump campaign are mostly negative, attacking Harris for inflation, blaming her for people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally and accusing her of being a dangerous liberal. Janiyah Thomas, Black media director at the Trump campaign, said the former president had a proven track record of creating opportunities for the Black community. ""To every Black American struggling to make ends meet, our message is clear: vote for the candidate who has consistently delivered on promises,"" she added. In August and September 2019, while Trump was president, the Black unemployment rate reached a new low of 5.3%. Under Biden, the rate fell even lower, to 4.8%, in 2023. Harris is running ads focused on proposals to lower drug prices, taxing large corporations and the ultra-wealthy to pay for housing, and tax breaks for working parents. Harris' campaign said it had been reaching out to Black voters across Georgia ""since day one."" ""Vice President Harris is fighting to lower costs for our families, protect our freedoms and make sure everyone in Georgia can not just get by, but get ahead,"" added Porsha White, the campaign's state director. 'GOD HELP OUR SOULS' Trump took about 11% of the Black vote in Georgia in the 2020 election, according to exit polls. If he were to pull in any higher share in November, he could win the state, said Andra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University. A poll conducted for CNN during the last week of August showed Harris with a one-percentage-point lead in the state, 48%-47%, with Trump getting 10% of the Black vote. A Trump victory in Georgia would relieve pressure for him to win all three of the midwestern battleground states, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But he risks alienating some voters with his inflammatory comments about Harris, a woman of Black and South Asian heritage. Trump has questioned the vice president's racial identity. ""God help our souls if Trump wins the election,"" said Demetrious Hall Sr., 62, a Black voter in Savannah who decried Trump's racist rhetoric and said he was voting for Harris. Trump's ally Childs brushed off those remarks in an interview after the Valdosta volunteer meeting, citing his economic policies that she said reduced Black unemployment, his help for historically Black colleges and universities, and his clampdown on illegal immigration as reasons to support him. Asked how she responds to voters who claim Trump is racist, Childs said: ""I say, 'Based on what?'"" Georgia's governor, Brian Kemp, showed that a Republican can increase his share of the Black vote in 2022, when he beat a Black Democrat, Stacey Abrams, in part because support from Black voters jumped 7 percentage points from their first match-up in 2018. Kemp focused on the economy and gun rights, said his former campaign manager, Bobby Saparow. Bruce LeVell, a Black businessman from Atlanta, said Trump's message on pocketbook issues resonated with voters of color. ""Black men especially and some of the women are really taking a look at their wallets,"" said LeVell, who hosted a roundtable of Black business owners with Trump when he visited Atlanta in early August. At the Embassy church in Austell in southern Cobb County, meanwhile, senior pastor B. Dwayne Hardin is also spreading the gospel of conservatism. At a recent service kicked off with an hour of boisterous gospel songs, Hardin told his Black congregation that America is heading towards socialism, that children are being indoctrinated in schools and the country ""is full of terrorists."" He said it was important to vote for people who ""shake things up."" Afterwards, in his private office, Hardin said he doesn't tell people to vote for Trump, but that Trump is on the right side of the issues such as individual liberty, school choice and economic empowerment. ""Do not worship the idol of skin color,"" he said he tells his flock.

Her remarks particularly highlight her commitment to tackling shared challenges in healthcare, clean energy, and climate change. “This trip is all about collaboration,” Biswal told PTI before her departure. “It’s not just about what India needs but how we can work together to solve global problems.” Her visit, her first to India in four years and first as DFC Deputy CEO, marks a significant moment in the evolving US-India relationship. Scheduled to start on September 10, Biswal’s four-day trip will focus on strengthening the US-India Strategic Partnership. She noted that India’s role is crucial in addressing global issues, citing the country’s pivotal contribution during the COVID-19 pandemic. “India was essential in managing the pandemic within its borders and in distributing vaccines worldwide,” Biswal noted. The DFC, under the Biden administration, has significantly invested in India, with over $3.8 billion in active projects. “India is our largest investment partner, with USD 2.5 billion invested in key areas like infrastructure, manufacturing, healthcare, and clean energy,” Biswal revealed. She highlighted that these investments are crucial for supporting India’s economic growth and enhancing access to capital. Biswal expressed enthusiasm about exploring new opportunities during her visit, particularly in climate and clean technology. “We want to ensure that as we advance technology, we’re not overly dependent on a single country. India is a top partner for diversifying technological manufacturing,” she said. Reflecting on her long-standing role in fostering US-India relations, Biswal, who has previously served as Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia and led the US-India Business Council, praised the deepening ties between the two nations. “It’s exhilarating to see how expansive and profound our partnership has become,” she said.

With his tenure wrapping up, Francis lauded India’s steadfast commitment to global cooperation and its substantial influence as a democracy of 1.4 billion people. “India is undoubtedly a leader at the United Nations,” Francis told PTI in an exclusive interview. “The country’s advocacy for multilateralism is greatly valued by the UN, and I fully expect that India will continue to play a significant role in global affairs.” As Francis prepares to hand over the reins to Philemon Yang, the former Prime Minister of Cameroon, who will assume the presidency of the 79th session on September 10, he highlighted India's growing influence. India has long pushed for reforms in the UN Security Council, advocating for a permanent seat to reflect today’s geopolitical realities better. Although India last served as a non-permanent member from 2021-22, its calls for a permanent seat continue to gain traction. Francis stressed India's role in South-South cooperation, commending its efforts in sharing expertise with developing nations. He also praised India's advancements in digitalisation, noting how these developments are crucial for economic growth and poverty alleviation. “Digitalisation is both an input to and a driver of economic development,” he said, reflecting on India’s successful use of technology to integrate millions into the formal economy. During his tenure, Francis visited India in January, meeting with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and travelling to Jaipur and Mumbai. His visit focused on issues such as sustainability, multilateralism, and digital public infrastructure. In a recent meeting with India’s newly appointed Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Parvathaneni Harish, Francis expressed his enthusiasm for future collaborations. “We had expansive and insightful discussions,” Francis remarked, noting their talks on peace and security, the upcoming Summit of the Future, and the urgent need for a ceasefire in Gaza. “I look forward to working with Ambassador Harish and his delegation.” As world leaders prepare for the UN’s 'Summit of the Future' on September 22-23, Francis remains optimistic about the outcome. The Summit is expected to produce the Pact for the Future, featuring a Global Digital Compact and a Declaration on Future Generations. Francis is hopeful that the Summit will invigorate efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and tackle pressing global challenges, including climate change and nuclear tensions. Despite scepticism about the relevance of multilateralism, Francis firmly believes in its vitality. “Multilateralism is not dead; it’s very much alive and continues to be a dynamic, productive force,” he asserted. “We hope the Summit will prove just that.” (With inputs from PTI) ",POSITIVE
Venezuelan opposition leader flees to Spain amid election controversy and escalating tensions,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/venezuelan-opposition-leader-flees-to-spain-amid-election-controversy-and-escalating-tensions-12816915.html,World," September 08, 2024 / 13:12   ","Edmundo GonzÃ¡lez, a former opposition presidential candidate in Venezuela, has fled to Spain, escalating tensions between Caracas and the international community. GonzÃ¡lez, who ran against President NicolÃ¡s Maduro in the July 28 election, sought refuge in the Spanish embassy in Caracas before his departure. This move comes amid widespread allegations of electoral fraud and political unrest. The Election Dispute GonzÃ¡lez's departure follows intense controversy over the election results. Despite Venezuelaâ€™s electoral commission and Supreme Court declaring Maduro the victor, GonzÃ¡lez and his supporters have contested the outcome, citing voting machine receipts that they claim show he won by a significant margin. The Maduro government has dismissed these claims, labeling them as attempts to incite unrest. Government Response and International Reaction Venezuelan Vice President Delcy RodrÃ­guez announced on social media that GonzÃ¡lez had been granted safe passage to Spain ""for the sake of tranquility and political peace."" This decision, she claimed, highlights Venezuela's adherence to international law. Spainâ€™s Foreign Minister JosÃ© Manuel Albares confirmed that GonzÃ¡lez was flown to Spain on a Spanish Air Force plane, responding quickly to his asylum request. Impact on Venezuela The contested election has triggered widespread protests across Venezuela, with Maduro's security forces cracking down on demonstrators and opposition figures. Anti-government protests have intensified, leading to hundreds of arrests and further repression. Critics accuse Maduro of electoral fraud and a broader effort to consolidate power after more than two decades of socialist rule. International Scrutiny and Diplomatic Tensions The election has drawn significant international criticism, with the European Union, the United States, and several Latin American nations refusing to recognize the results. Calls for transparency from foreign governments and independent observers have intensified. Meanwhile, Venezuelaâ€™s diplomatic relations are strained, particularly after the Maduro government revoked Brazilâ€™s authorization to represent Argentine interests, sparking criticism from Brazil and Argentina. Ongoing Crisis and Political Implications Maduro remains in control, bolstered by key institutions like the military and judiciary. Despite facing severe challenges, his administration continues to hold power. The ongoing political and economic instability in Venezuela has driven millions to seek better lives abroad, reflecting a broader crisis that has plagued the country for over a decade.

The report, based on research led by British lawyer Trevor Asserson, claims the broadcaster exhibited a ""deeply worrying pattern of bias against Israel."" The investigation, which analysed four months of BBC output across television, radio, online news, podcasts, and social media, involved a team of around 20 lawyers and 20 data scientists. The team employed artificial intelligence (AI) to scrutinise over nine million words of BBC content. Their findings highlight that Israel was associated with genocide 14 times more often than Hamas, despite the group's status as a terror organisation. The total number of editorial breaches, spanning issues of impartiality, accuracy, editorial values, and public interest, reached 1,553. According to the report, Hamas terrorism was repeatedly downplayed, while Israel was depicted as a ""militaristic and aggressive nation."" One of the most significant areas of concern was BBC Arabic, which, according to the research, demonstrated a particularly biased stance. The report uncovered 11 instances where reporters from BBC Arabic publicly supported acts of terrorism, especially those carried out by Hamas, without this bias being disclosed to viewers. In response to the findings, the BBC stated it would ""carefully consider"" the report, but questioned the methodology, particularly the use of AI to analyse coverage, Telegraph wrote. A BBC spokesman stressed that “coverage can’t be assessed solely by counting particular words divorced from context.” The report has sparked calls for an independent review of the BBC’s coverage of Israel, with Laurence Julius, vice-chairman of the National Jewish Assembly, criticising the broadcaster for promoting an anti-Israel and anti-Semitic narrative. Asserson, who has monitored BBC coverage of Israel for two decades, warned that the BBC's conduct raises serious concerns about its role as a publicly funded broadcaster. “Such conduct not only breaches the BBC’s Royal Charter but also calls into question its suitability for continued public funding,” he said. The BBC has faced scrutiny since the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, after which it announced it would label Hamas as a terrorist organisation where possible. However, the research revealed that out of 12,459 mentions of Hamas, only 409 (3.2 percent) referred to the group as terrorists. The report has been submitted to the BBC's leadership, including its director-general and board members, as pressure mounts on the broadcaster to address concerns about impartiality in its reporting on the Israel-Hamas conflict.

Planning to visit Greece soon? These new taxes on tourists could spoil your holiday mood,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/planning-to-visit-greece-soon-these-new-taxes-on-tourists-could-spoil-your-holiday-mood-12816884.html,World," September 08, 2024 / 11:09   ","Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced measures aimed at addressing the negative impact of overtourism as visitors continue to arrive in record numbers in the post-pandemic era. The government has been “very concerned” about an influx of cruise passengers during certain months of the year and will begin charging fees, Mitsotakis said Saturday during his annual speech at the Thessaloniki International Fair. It will also increase a tax related to the climate-crisis on accommodation. Greece received a record 36.1 million visitors in 2023, while arrivals rose 16% to 11.6 million in the first half of 2024, according to the latest data from the Bank of Greece. The tourism sector contributes about 20% to the economy, making it vital to the health of the nation. The country will also expand its so-called “Golden Visa” program to investors who are willing to put at least €250,000 ($277,000) into local startups. Foreigners were previously required to buy property to acquire the visa. All passengers arriving at Greek ports will pay a fee, and the charge will be greater in the popular tourism islands of Santorini and Mykonos. A lodging tax for the April-to-October period also will be increased, with revenue benefiting local communities. Mitsotakis reiterated concern that parts of Greece face the problem of “overtourism.” In an interview with Bloomberg in June, he announced plans to restrict cruise ships visiting the country’s most popular islands from 2025. Short-term rentals have been blamed for fueling the country’s housing crisis, which along with high consumer prices has been at the center of recent political debate. The government will ban any new short-term leasing for at least one year in three main parts of Athens, Mitsotakis said. Property owners who change leases from short-term to long-term won’t have to pay rental tax for three years, as will owners who decide to rent their homes instead of keeping them off the market, he said. Holiday rentals increased an annual average of 28% from 2019 to 2023, while available short-term rentals doubled in the same period. Meanwhile, hotel accommodation rose just 3.5% in that period, according to data published in a Grant Thornton report for the country’s Chamber of Hotels released this week. The government will also begin a new €2 billion program that will be used to reduce interest-rate costs for mortgage loans. More Measures Mitsotakis on Saturday also revealed a number of measures aimed at easing the cost of living, including a reduction in social insurance contributions by 1 percentage point in 2025 instead of a previous plan for a 0.5 point cut. The premier also announced, among others: -A 2.2%-to-2.5% increase in around 2 million pensions from Jan. 1.-An increase in minimum wages beginning in April-An increase in public sector wages, especially to doctors, firefighters and workers in the army and policy forces.-Various tax reliefs to help the self-employed, farmers and others-Changes to unemployment benefits “I don’t have a sack of reckless spending today,” he said. “Our spending for 2025 is well balanced.” Greece has already pledged to meet a budget primary surplus — an index that shows revenue minus spending excluding interest payments — of 2.1% of GDP for both 2024 and 2025, up from 1.9% in 2023. Fiscal discipline is one of the most important criteria for financial markets, and the country’s recent prudent budget path was one of the drivers for ratings companies to return Greece to the investment grade zone in 2023 after 13 years at junk status. “Healthy and rising primary surpluses, in tandem with sound nominal growth, will facilitate further significant reduction in the public debt-to-GDP, which is expected to fall to below 140% by 2027, from 161.9% in 2023,” DBRS Morningstar said Friday.

US believes Iran has transferred short-range ballistic missiles to Russia,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/us-believes-iran-has-transferred-short-range-ballistic-missiles-to-russia-12816882.html,World," September 08, 2024 / 11:06   ","The United States has informed allies that it believes Iran has transferred short-range ballistic missiles to Russia for its war in Ukraine, according to two people familiar with the matter. They did not offer any details about how many weapons have been delivered or when the transfers may have occurred, but they confirmed the US intelligence finding. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a matter that has not been disclosed publicly disclosed. The White House declined to confirm the weapons transfer but reiterated its concern that Iran is deepening its support of Russia. The White House has been warning Iran for months not to transfer ballistic missiles to Russia. ""Any transfer of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia would represent a dramatic escalation in Iran's support for Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and lead to the killing of more Ukrainian civilians,"" National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said in a statement. ""This partnership threatens European security and illustrates how Iran's destabilising influence reaches beyond the Middle East and around the world. The US finding comes as the Kremlin tries to repel Ukraine's surprise offensive that has led to the seizure of about 500 square miles (1,300 kilometers) of Russia's Kursk region. Meanwhile, Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is pressing allies to allow his country to use Western-supplied missiles to strike deep inside Russia and hit sites from which Moscow launches aerial attacks. Iran, as it has with previous US intelligence findings, denied providing Russia with weapons for its war in Ukraine. Iran considers the provision of military assistance to the parties engaged in the conflict which leads to increased human casualties, destruction of infrastructure, and a distancing from ceasefire negotiations to be inhumane, according to a statement from Iran's mission to the United Nations.""Thus, not only does Iran abstain from engaging in such actions itself, but it also calls upon other countries to cease the supply of weapons to the sides involved in the conflict. CIA Director William Burns, who was in London on Saturday for a joint appearance with his British intelligence counterpart, warned of the growing and troubling defence relationship involving Russia, China, Iran and North Korea that he said threatens both Ukraine and Western allies in the Middle East.The White House has repeatedly declassified and publicised intelligence findings that show North Korea has sent ammunition and missiles to Russia to use against Ukraine, while Iran supplies Moscow with attack drones and has assisted the Kremlin with building a drone-manufacturing factory. China has held back from providing Russians with weaponry but has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry, according to US officials. The White House has been on edge for months about a possible deal between Iran and Russia. The Democratic administration said in January that US intelligence officials had determined a Russian-Iran deal had not been completed, but officials were concerned that Russia's negotiations to acquire missiles from Iran were actively advancing. Last September, according to the White House, Iran hosted a top Russian defence official to show off a range of ballistic missile systems, adding to the US concern that a deal could come together. The US and other countries have taken steps aimed at thwarting the supply, sale or transfer involving Iran and ballistic missile-related items, including issuing guidance to private companies about Iranian missile procurement practices to make sure those companies are not inadvertently supporting Iran's development efforts. President Joe Biden is set to host British Prime Minister Keir Starmer for talks at the White House on Friday. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said continuing robust support to Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression will be on their agenda. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the US intelligence finding.

Brazil's X ban drives Bolsonaro supporters to rally for 'free speech',https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/brazils-x-ban-drives-bolsonaro-supporters-to-rally-for-free-speech-12816883.html,World," September 08, 2024 / 10:54   ","Supporters of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro began flooding Sao Paulo's main boulevard for an Independence Day rally on Saturday, buoyed by the government's blocking of tech billionaire Elon Musk's X platform, a ban they say is proof of their political persecution. A few thousand demonstrators, clad in the yellow-and-green colours of Brazil's flag, poured onto Av. Paulista. References to the ban on X and images of Musk abounded. Thank you for defending our freedom, read one banner praising the tech entrepreneur. Saturday's march is a test of Bolsonaro's capacity to mobilize turnout ahead of the October municipal elections, even though Brazil's electoral court has barred him from running for office until 2030. It's also something of a referendum on X, whose suspension has raised eyebrows even among some of Bolsonaro's opponents all the while stoking the flames of Brazil's deep-seated political polarisation.A country without liberty can't celebrate anything this day, Bolsonaro wrote on his Instagram account September 4, urging Brazilians to stay away from official independence day parades and instead join him in Sao Paulo. Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered X's nationwide ban on August 30 after months of feuding with Musk over the limits of free speech.The powerful judge has spearheaded efforts to ban far-right users from spreading misinformation on social media, and he ramped up his clampdown after die-hard Bolsonaro supporters ransacked Congress and the presidential palace on January 8, 2023, in an attempt to overturn Bolsonaro's defeat in the presidential election. The ban is red meat to Bolsonaro's allies, who have accused the judiciary and President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's government of colluding to silence their movement.Elon Musk has been a warrior for freedom of speech, staunch Bolsonaro ally and lawmaker Bia Kicis said in an interview. The right is being oppressed, massacred, because the left doesn't want the right to exist. Our liberties are in danger, we need to make our voices heard. De Moraes is a tyrant, he should be impeached, and people on the streets is the only thing that will convince politicians to do it, added retiree Amaro Santos as he walked down the thoroughfare on Saturday. Musk, a self-proclaimed free speech absolutist, has also urged Brazilians to turn out in droves for the rally, resharing someone else's post claiming that X's ban had awakened people to the fact that freedom isn't free and needs to be fought for. He's also created an X account, named for the controversial jurist, to publish sealed court orders directing X to shut down accounts deemed unlawful.But De Moraes' decision to ban X was far from arbitrary, having been upheld by fellow Supreme Court justices. And while online expression is more easily censored under Brazil's laws than it is in the US, Musk has emerged as both a cause celebre and a mouthpiece for unrestricted free speech. Since 2019, X has shut down 226 accounts of far-right activities accused of undermining Brazil's democracy, including those of lawmakers affiliated with Bolsonaro's party, according to court records. But when it refused to take action on some accounts, de Moraes warned last month that its top executive could be arrested, prompting X to disband its local office. The US-based company refused to name a new legal representative as required in order to receive court notices and de Moraes ordered its nationwide suspension until it did so. A Supreme Court panel unanimously upheld de Moraes' decision to block X days later, undermining Musk's efforts to cast him as an authoritarian bent on censoring political speech. The more controversial component of his ruling was the levy of a whopping USD 9,000 daily fine for regular Brazilians using virtual private networks (VPNs) to access X. Some of these measures that have been adopted by the Supreme Court appear to be quite onerous and abusive, said Andrei Roman, CEO of Brazil-based pollster Atlas Intel.In the lead-up to Saturday's protest, some right-wing politicians defied de Moraes' ban and brazenly used a VPN to publish posts on X, calling for people to partake in the protests. The march in Sao Paulo is organized in parallel to official events to celebrate Brazil's anniversary of independence from Portugal. Commemorations have been fraught with tension in recent years, as Bolsonaro used them while in office to rally supporters and show political strength. Three years ago, he threatened to plunge the country into a constitutional crisis when he declared he would no longer abide de Moraes' rulings. He has since toned down the attacks a reflection of his own delicate legal situation. Bolsonaro has been indicted twice since his term ended in 2022, most recently for alleged money laundering in connection with undeclared diamonds from Saudi Arabia. De Moraes is overseeing an investigation into the January 8 riot, including whether Bolsonaro had a role in inciting it.

During a visit to the Islamic Foundation in Rajshahi, where he also attended a gathering of dignitaries, Hossain emphasized, ""The interim government will not engage in any actions that could stir controversy."" This statement came in response to a call from Abdullahil Amaan Azmi, the son of former Jamaat-e-Islami leader Ghulam Azam, who had earlier this week suggested that Bangladesh consider changing its national anthem and Constitution. Azmi argued, “The current national anthem reflects the era of the Bengal partition and the union of the two Bengals. It does not represent the spirit of independent Bangladesh. This anthem was imposed upon us by India in 1971. A new commission should be formed to select an anthem that better reflects our nation.” Addressing these remarks, Hossain reiterated that Bangladesh values its relationship with India, stating, “As a neighboring country, we wish to maintain friendly ties with India.” He also commented on recent reports of alleged attacks on Bangladesh’s cricket team in India, noting that the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) is responsible for determining the appropriate course of action. Hossain also condemned attacks on religious sites, describing them as “heinous acts.” He added, ""Those who attack places of worship are enemies of humanity and will face prosecution under the existing laws."" In a move to safeguard temples during the upcoming Durga Puja, Hossain mentioned that madrasa students, alongside local citizens, would take on the responsibility of guarding these sites. He dispelled previous claims linking madrasa students to terrorism, calling them “propaganda and conspiracy by the previous government.” The advisor also highlighted recent attacks on the homes of both Hindu and Muslim communities, urging that such incidents should not be viewed differently, emphasizing that they all deserve equal attention and action.

Algeria Presidential Election sees low turnout; incumbent Tebboune favoured for second term,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/algeria-presidential-election-sees-low-turnout-incumbent-tebboune-favoured-for-second-term-12816863.html,World," September 08, 2024 / 09:39   ","In Algeria's presidential election held on Saturday, preliminary figures reveal that less than half of the country's eligible voters cast their ballots. Despite hopes for a high turnout, the election has been marked by widespread apathy. Incumbent President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, 78, is heavily favoured to secure a second term against his main challengers: moderate Islamist Abdelaali Hassani, 57, and socialist candidate Youcef Aouchiche, 41. Tebboune's primary challenge was to boost voter participation after the historically low turnout of over 60 percent in the 2019 election, which saw him elected in the wake of mass protests demanding the resignation of former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. The National Independent Authority for Elections (ANIE) reported an ""average turnout"" of 48 percent early Sunday, but did not provide specific numbers. The announcement was delayed by three hours as officials extended the voting period by one hour to accommodate voters who might have been deterred by the heat. Analyst Hasni AbidiÂ slammed the candidates' lackluster campaigns, noting Tebboune's minimal public engagements and his challengers' inadequate efforts. He suggested that the low turnout reflects a broader disconnection from the electoral process rather than an active political opposition. Both of Tebboune's challengers had urged voters to participate. Aouchiche emphasised voting as a way to build a better future, while Hassani hoped for a strong turnout to lend credibility to the election. Despite these calls, many polling stations in Algiers were sparsely attended, with voters hesitant to brave the summer heat. Tebboune, who has been in office since December 2019, framed his campaign around the idea of continuing the ""New Algeria"" project, a term he uses to describe the country's path since the Hirak protests. The 78-year-old president has used oil and gas revenue to fund social benefits such as unemployment insurance and public pensions, aiming to mitigate public discontent. Despite these efforts, many remain skeptical about the election's ability to effect genuine change. Activists and international organisations, including Amnesty International, have criticised ongoing repression and the prosecution of dissent. Former Hirak leader Hakim Addad condemned the election as a mere formality that will entrench the current regime. The official results and final voter turnout figures are expected to be released later on Sunday. As Algeria continues to grapple with high living costs and water shortages, the election's outcome will be closely watched for indications of future political stability and reform. The election campaign struggled to engage voters in a nation plagued by economic challenges and a summer heatwave. With more than 24 million registered voters, including a significant youth population, the low turnout underscores ongoing disillusionment with the political process. Tebbouneâ€™s challengers, including Abdelali Hassani Cherif of the Movement of Society for Peace (MSP) and Youcef Aouchiche of the Socialist Forces Front (FFS), had hoped to mobilise voters by promising increased freedoms and economic opportunities. However, both candidates faced criticism for participating in what many perceive as a flawed electoral process. As vote counting begins, the results will reveal whether Tebbouneâ€™s efforts to boost participation have been successful and how Algerians view the future of their country's democracy.

The latest decision allows US President Joe Biden to host the summit in his hometown, making it a significant event as it will be the final summit for both Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who are expected to step down soon. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will also attend the summit, aligning with their visit to the US for the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). PM Modi is scheduled to address the “Summit of the Future” during the UNGA. The move to Wilmington, reported by Japanese newspaper Nikkei Asia, came after consultations among Quad partners. This arrangement lets Biden host the summit in his final year as president, while India will now host the Quad summit in 2025, potentially under the new US administration led by either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris. The Wilmington summit will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Quad’s formation and will address a comprehensive agenda, including COVID-19 response, emerging technologies, and supply chain cooperation. Despite the Quad's growing significance in the Indo-Pacific, the summit occurs amidst a heated US presidential election campaign. In a related development, Indian officials have confirmed that the decision to swap hosting duties was finalised after discussions between PM Modi, Biden, and Australian leaders. The Quad, initially formed in 2004 for disaster response, was revitalised in 2017 under former President Trump. Biden’s administration held the first leader-level summits, both virtually in March 2021 and in person at the White House in September 2021. On September 22, PM Modi will also address a diaspora event in New York and attend the “Summit of the Future” at the UN. However, he will not remain to deliver his address to the UN General Assembly, which will now be presented by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on September 28.

The incident began just before 6 p.m. (1000 GMT) about nine miles outside of London, when officers were called for reports of multiple vehicles being fired at on Interstate 75 in Laurel County, multiple media accounts said. The shots were reportedly coming from a wooded area or an overpass. How many were shot and the nature of the injuries was not immediately clear. But the Louisville Courier-Journal reported that between four and six people were injured, citing the Kentucky State Police.Police officials said the suspect had not been caught. About 3 hours after the shooting, the laurel County Sheriff's Office named a ""person of interest"" who is to be considered ""ARMED AND DANGEROUS"" and cautioned the public not to approach the 32-year-old man. “Please avoid I-75 around Ext 49. Until further notice! Use alternative route do not be any where in that area,” London Mayor Randall Weddle said on Facebook. Kentucky state Trooper Scottie Pennington wrote on Facebook, ""The suspect has not been caught at this time and we are urging people to stay inside.""

The highway was temporarily closed but has since reopened. Authorities are actively searching for Joseph Couch, 32, described as ""armed and dangerous"" by law enforcement. The Laurel County Sheriff's Office has advised the public to avoid approaching the suspect and to remain indoors while the search continues. Laurel County Mayor Randall Weddle urged residents to keep their doors locked as the search for Couch continues. Federal agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) have joined the investigation, labeling the situation a ""critical incident."" This shooting follows a recent school shooting in Winder, Georgia, where two students and two teachers were killed. A 14-year-old student and his father, who allegedly provided the firearm, have been charged in connection with that incident. The United States continues to grapple with gun violence, with more firearms in the country than people. Despite public support for stricter gun control, significant political opposition has hindered comprehensive reforms. The 2022 gun safety package, which enhanced background checks and supported ""Red Flag"" laws, marked progress, but advocates argue more is needed. In response to the recent violence, Republican candidate Donald Trump expressed condolences for the victims of the Georgia shooting, while Democratic nominee Kamala Harris has called for renewed efforts to pass an assault weapons ban.

Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | Stock market investment is a game of probabilities,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-pro-panorama-the-game-of-probabilities-12816257.html,Economy," September 06, 2024 / 15:57   ","Dear Reader, The Panorama newsletter is sent to Moneycontrol Pro subscribers on market days. It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of.  The stock market is often likened to a Las Vegas casino, and with good reason. Everybody enters a casino with the confidence that they have the will power to fold early should things go south. But everyone who exits the casino learns that almost nobody has this will power. You either win or you lose, but the lure of going all-in is strong at every table. If not all-in, you end up going at least up to your neck. Most of India’s retail investors fall in this category of having the false sense of rationality in their investment decisions. What else can explain the current high spirits of India’s equity indices even though a bunch of indicators do not speak highly of its economy anymore? The GDP growth itself has slowed and is expected to be lower than FY24. Credit growth has decelerated, exports are at an ugly turn and the employment narrative is not as optimistic as official data paints it to be. Even the soaring indirect tax collections must be taken with a bag of salt as this column points out. But the most telling of them is the fact that eight out of ten futures and options traders make losses. Still this segment is going all guns blazing in terms of volume even today. Institutional investors are a savvy lot and a notch above them are the promoters selling stake in their companies through initial public offers and pocketing a nauseatingly high level of gains through cranked up valuations by an overindulgent market. So, is the retail investor doomed to be the optimist that ends up holding the baby? We need not be. Not everyone that exits a Vegas casino is in tears, some are exuberant. They were perhaps probabilistic and took bets after working out the risks in favour and against. This sublime piece by Tim Harford in FT, free to read for Moneycontrol subscribers, explains what being probabilistic is. Being aware of probabilities gives an investor confidence to be contrarian during times of extreme one way movements in the market. Betting on a policy rate cut by the US Federal Reserve or even by the Reserve Bank of India is not such a daunting task when we look at data and figure out the odds of them coming true. Unfortunately, Indian retail investors are ignoring all the red flags in the economy right now believing that big gains are waiting for them even at exalted valuations. Even analysts are split in their expectations from the RBI. Those at Nomura believe that the central bank can announce the first rate cut next month citing a clutch of data that dispels the notion that inflation is still at an uncomfortable level. Barclays economists do not see a rate cut until December while those at Citigroup forecast a hawkish RBI to go for the chop only next fiscal year. If analysts are split, what can retail investors do? If we do not have the tools to arrive at probabilities, we can guess them. That is why geopolitical analysts can only make an educated guess.  As Harford writes, “Sometimes, we have a good idea of the risks we face, and sometimes, we don’t have a clue.” During clueless times, “We should all be asking ourselves what we know, what we don’t and how we plan to fill the gap in our knowledge.” One such gap will be filled for the US rate cut punters later today by the non-farm payroll data. Employment is the critical metric that the Fed tracks closely in taking decisions. If the jobs data turns out to be robust, the odds of a rate cut dim and vice-versa. Back here, we will have the retail inflation data due next week which could give us an opportunity to either change or cement our bets on the RBI’s rate cut probability. While the equity market still looks to be high on hope, there are sections that show investors are recalculating their probabilities. The sharp correction in shares of public sector companies over the past month is a sign that investors noticed the underperformance of these companies and found valuations to be bloated. As this column states , the phase of speculative investment based on narratives is firmly behind us. Investors must also assess data while picking up IPO stocks. Twelve IPOs will vie for attention next week, one of them is Bajaj Housing Finance. While we wrote that the lender needs more than a successful IPO to become the most valuable housing finance company, a look at the housing loan market should give enough insights to take a view. Our Chart of the Day shows that home loans were the slowest segment to grow among retail lending in FY24. It is said that casinos are meant to shut the outside world to the players and hence, do not let the sunlight in. Once you enter, you never know whether it is day or night until you step out. Ergo, it pays to step out to breathe and look at other things to diversify. One such asset that wins the diversification argument every time is gold. Ananya Roy lays out the probability of the yellow metal’s trajectory here.

GST Rate Rationalisation: Impact on different industries and challenges in tax simplification,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/gst-rate-rationalisation-impact-on-different-industries-and-challenges-in-tax-simplification-12815835.html,Economy," September 08, 2024 / 11:45   ","By Smita Singh, Prateek Sagar, and Anuj JhanwarÂ  The issue of GST rate rationalisation has been consistently addressed with the GST Council over the last six years. Various steps have been taken and issues discussed to streamline the process. It is well-known that the Fitment Committee has been working on rate rationalisation for various goods and services, including reviewing the option of a three-slab structure. Despite the complexities arising from multiple tax rate slabs, the measures undertaken aim to simplify the previously complex tax structure. The primary goal of rate rationalisation is not to increase government revenue but to streamline tax rates across sectors, thereby reducing the cascading effect of taxes and litigation related to tax classifications. Impact on Manufacturing and Compliance The manufacturing industry is broaching the subject of GST rationalisation with much fervour. The aim of the GST rate structure is to make tax systems simpler while at the same time keeping revenues neutral, which is not an easy task. In order to resolve classification challenges and relieve manufacturing sector from compliance strains, experts have proposed combining the 12% and 18% slabs and overhaul of the existing four-tiered GST rate structure of 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%. The present inverted duty structure where input rates exceed output rates has resulted to blockage of cash flow for various industries such as textile, solar, edible oils, etc. This will also address the issue of classification for availing a beneficial rate. In the past, Government has exempted GST on sanitary napkins as a rate rationalisation measure. As a result, the manufactures were denied the benefit of ITC which compelled the manufacturers to add the cost of ITC denied on raw materials to the price of final product, thereby increasing the market price of sanitary napkin. The overall impact of GST rate rationalisation on sanitary napkin remained ineffective. Challenges Faced by Different Sectors The insurance sector attracts a GST rate of 18% presently, the industry has been demanding reduction in tax rates, especially for health insurance services. Further, restaurant services attract GST @ 5% without any benefit of claiming Input Tax Credit (ITC). However, the restaurant sector has been demanding an optional structure for themselves that allow ITC with tax @12% on restaurant services. The real estate sector has encountered mixed effects from GST rate rationalisation. In the past, GST structure for construction services and related activities amended comprehensively. For residential properties, the rationalisation has resulted in lower GST rates, however, since ITC cannot be availed by this sector, the overall cost of housing becomes costlier. Further, cement which is a major component of the real estate sector is taxable at the highest rate of 28%, even in case of affordable schemes as well. Hence, the sector requires relief in this aspect. The tourism and hospitality sector seeks GST rate rationalisation to make the sector more affordable. GST rates on luxury hotels and high-end travel services is high as compared to other categories, which affect consumer demand in these segments. In pharmaceutical sector, various inputs used in preparing medications attract 18%, while the final product is in 5% tax slab. Similarly, electric vehicles is taxed at the rate of 5%, while its input involves range in the slab of 18-28%. Hence, GST Council may re-look at the GST rates where inverted duty scenarios arise. Separately, introducing ATF and natural gas within the ambit of GST, which is presently not leviable to GST, is also under pipeline. Presently, ITC of GST is not available and is added in the cost incurred by oil and gas companies. Balancing Sector-Specific Needs GST rate rationalisation has had a profound impact on various sectors, each adjusting to the new tax landscape in different ways. While many sectors benefit from the simplified tax structure and reduced rates, others face challenges related to compliance and transitional issues. Overall, the goal of GST rationalisation is to create a more transparent, efficient, and equitable tax environment, fostering economic growth and improving the business climate across India.

Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | Time for a reality check in equity markets?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-pro-panorama-time-for-a-reality-check-in-equity-markets-12815219.html,Economy," September 06, 2024 / 15:44   ","Dear Reader, The Panorama newsletter is sent to Moneycontrol Pro subscribers on market days. It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. This week saw the backlash of stock prices of two mega companies on the US bourses. One, the chip maker Nvidia, whose shares plunged by about 9.5 percent on Tuesday wiping out about $300 billion in a single day! Two, in a completely different industry segment, US Steel shares too tanked 25 percent, with trading briefly halted after news reports alleging that its $14.1 billion deal with Japan's Nippon Steel may be at risk. These are two of the most recent and glaring examples where mere whispers in investor circles -- not confirmed at times -- are sufficient to erase a lifetime of gains made in equity markets. There are numerous such instances in equity markets across countries, developed and emerging, where stock prices have crashed leaving investors in financial distress. And it is not always stock-specific debacles that investors have witnessed. At times, there is a market rout that put investors in a quandary (Japanese Yen carry trade, Middle-East conflict). In this context, it is perhaps time for a reality check in Indian equities, given the unabated rally. Driven by liquidity and unfettered by rising valuations, the Nifty 50 is holding up beyond 25,000 and the BSE Sensex above 82,000. Valuations are not reasonable. On the contrary, the price-to-earnings multiples are at a slight premium to the 10-year averages across segments -- large-cap, mid-cap and small-caps. This article highlights that all is not well in mid-caps. “A significant portion of the rally in mid-caps can be attributed to the substantial inflows of mid-cap, small-cap, and sectoral/thematic funds,” it states. Besides, recent macroeconomic data have not been flattering. Q1 FY2025 gross domestic growth (GDP) faltered, so did the Purchasing Managers’ Index for August, which slowed. At a micro level, the earnings growth for the quarter moderated on the back of a revenue slowdown. Several sectors such as auto, cement and conspicuous goods consumption portray moderation in growth. Indeed, the silver lining is softening inflation which is raising hopes of an interest rate cut sooner than later. For investors, the dilemma would be whether to opt for a paltry 6-7 percent return from secure fixed income or continue riding the bullish sentiment in equity markets till it lasts.

Hoodas used wrestlers like Pandavas did Draupadi: Former WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/hoodas-used-wrestlers-like-pandavas-did-draupadi-former-wfi-chief-brij-bhushan-sharan-singh-12817036.html,Politics," September 08, 2024 / 17:32   ","Former BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh on Sunday accused the Hooda family of Congress of conspiring against him by using wrestlers as wager just as Pandavas had put Draupadi at stake. Singh, a former chief of Wrestling Federation of India, was last year accused of sexual assault by several female wrestlers, who sat on a protest for weeks demanding a probe against him. At his residence on Sunday, he told reporters, ”In the gambling which took place in Mahabharat, Draupadi was put at stake. The Pandavas lost. The country is still not able to accept their reasons for doing it.” He added, ”The Hooda family … put the honour of daughters and sisters at stake. The future generation will not forgive them for this and they will always be held guilty for this.” Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia, who is an Olympic bronze-medallist, along with another Olympic bronze-winner Sakshi Malik spearheaded the agitation last year. Singh said, ”Bajrang Punia’s mental condition has deteriorated. He had put his wife at stake. I want to ask him why he went to play in the Asian Games without trials?” Asked about the wrestlers’ protest in Delhi, Singh said, ”There was no protest of wrestlers in Delhi. It was a family protest. When we say wrestlers, a group comes. Are wrestlers not in Punjab, Haryana? Are they not in Maharashtra, Bihar, UP, Bengal and Himachal?” He accused Congress leader Deepender Hooda of leading the protest at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar. ”Priyanka Gandhi also used to come.” On Saturday, Singh, the former BJP MP from Kaiserganj, had said that Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia were used by the Congress as ”pawns” in a ”conspiracy” to take control of the Wrestling Federation of India. Singh first got control of WFI in 2012 after a bitter turf war with Deepender Singh Hooda. The agitation forced Singh, a six-time Lok Sabha MP from the Kaiserganj constituency, to step down from the position of WFI head. He is currently facing criminal charges in a court. After his ouster, his close aide Sanjay Singh was elected as the head of WFI but the body is yet to get recognition from the sports ministry, even though the world governing body for wrestling, UWW, has endorsed it. On Friday, Phogat and Punia joined the Congress with a vow of ”not being scared or backing off.” Subsequently, the Congress released its first list of 32 candidates for the Haryana Assembly polls, fielding former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda from Garhi Sampla-Kiloi, state unit chief Udai Bhan from Hodal and Vinesh Phogat from Julana.

After the recent by-elections, the Upper House has an effective strength of 234, with the BJP having 96 members of its own. The number of NDA MPs is 113. Six nominated members, who usually cast their vote with the government, take the strength of the NDA to 119, two more than the current halfway mark of 117.The Congress has 27 members in the Upper House and its allies add another 58, taking the opposition alliance numbers to 85. Among the key fence-sitters are the YSR Congress Party with nine members and the BJD with seven members.There are four AIADMK members, three Independents and other MPs from smaller parties who are not aligned to either of the two major groups.Four seats from Jammu and Kashmir in the Upper House are vacant as the Union Territory is yet to get its first legislative assembly.

US CPI in the spotlight next week as markets seek clarity on Fed's first rate cut,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/commodities/us-cpi-in-the-spotlight-next-week-as-markets-seek-clarity-on-feds-first-rate-cut-12817159.html,Market," September 08, 2024 / 23:13   ","By Kaynat Chainwala, AVP Commodity Research at Kotak Securities Markets ended on a weaker note as the highly anticipated US jobs report failed to provide clarity on the scale of potential rate cuts, leaving traders disappointed. The US dollar experienced significant fluctuations as moderating US inflation pushed the dollar to 101.91, followed by a sharp pullback to 100.58 as lower-than-expected private payrolls and weaker jobs openings increased bets on bigger rate cuts. Nevertheless, the mixed official jobs report left the debate over a 25 or 50 bps rate cut unresolved, helping the dollar rebound and close above 101. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 1,42,000 last month, bringing the three-month average to its lowest level since mid-2020. Meanwhile, unemployment rate decreased to 4.2 percent, marking its first decline in five months; average hourly earnings rose by 0.4 percent on a monthly basis and 3.8 percent year-over-year, surpassing estimates. This mixed data suggested both a potential slowdown in the labour market and uncertainty over the September rate cut outlook, contributing to the worst weekly losses for US equities this year during the first week of September, a historically challenging month for markets. COMEX Gold traded within a narrow range throughout the week as traders awaited the US jobs data for insights into the Federal Reserve's potential rate cut path. Gold saw a sharp rise to $2,560 per ounce on Friday before retreating and closing the week flat at $2,526.8 per ounce, while silver fell 3 percent to $28 per troy ounce, in line with the dollar's rebound following the jobs report. On the daily chart, MCX Silver December futures fell dramatically on Friday, marking the biggest daily drop (-2.59 percent) in a month. Price also closed lowest in the recent three weeks. On the weekly and daily charts, the price is trading below the 20 EMA and Supertrend (7,3), indicating a bearish bias. Price may maintain its negative momentum next week, finding initial support at Rs 80,440 per kg, which if broken and sustained, may see bears bring prices down to the next support level of Rs 79,000. On the flip side, the nearest resistance is at Rs 85,945, followed by Rs 88,350. WTI crude oil extended its losses into September and slipped to a 14-month low of $67.17 per barrel due to concerns over US and Chinese demand amid a potential resolution of the Libyan political dispute. Despite OPEC's announcement to not increase output by 180,000 barrels per day in October and November and a drop in US oil stocks to a one-year low, prices struggled to gain upward momentum. LME base metals also faced significant losses this week, driven by weak manufacturing PMI numbers from the US and China, which dented demand prospects. Additionally, disappointing new home sales data from China indicated that efforts to address the real estate downturn and boost economic activity have not been successful. Zinc led the declines, plunging 6Â percent amid ongoing issues at Chinese steel mills. Upcoming key data releases from China could add further downward pressure on crude oil and metal prices if they continue to reflect a bleak economic outlook. Cooling inflation and tepid growth have sharply increased the likelihood of a 25 basis point rate cut by the ECB in its upcoming policy meeting. However, US CPI will capture the most attention from market participants as one of the final indicators before the FOMC's rate decision on September 18, with persistent inflation potentially reducing the likelihood of a 50 basis point rate cut.

The momentum indicator RSI also showed a negative crossover. The index tanked 896 points, or 1.74 percent, to 50,577.  3) Nifty Call Options Data According to the weekly options data, the maximum open interest was seen at the 26,000 strike (with 87.29 lakh contracts). This level can act as a key resistance level for the Nifty in the short term. It was followed by the 25,200 strike (69.71 lakh contracts) and the 25,000 strike (66.28 lakh contracts). Maximum Call writing was seen at the 25,000 strike, which saw an addition of 52.12 lakh contracts, followed by the 25,100 and 25,200 strikes, which added 50.01 lakh and 33.04 lakh contracts, respectively. There was hardly any unwinding seen.  4) Nifty Put Options Data On the Put side, the 24,000 strike holds the maximum open interest (with 47.47 lakh contracts), which can act as a key support level for the Nifty. It was followed by the 24,500 strike (41.79 lakh contracts) and the 25,000 strike (28.77 lakh contracts). The maximum Put writing was observed at the 24,900 strike, which saw an addition of 10.88 lakh contracts, followed by the 24,000 and 24,800 strikes, with 8.24 lakh and 7.04 lakh contracts added, respectively, while the Put unwinding was seen at the 25,000 strike, which shed 10.9 lakh contracts, followed by the 25,200 and 25,100 strikes, which shed 10.25 lakh and 5.51 lakh contracts, respectively.  5) Bank Nifty Call Options Data According to the weekly options data, the maximum open interest was seen at the 51,500 strike, with 43.26 lakh contracts. This can act as a key resistance level for the index in the short term. It was followed by the 51,000 strike (30.64 lakh contracts) and the 51,400 strike (24.12 lakh contracts). Maximum Call writing was visible at the 51,000 strike (with the addition of 26.55 lakh contracts), followed by the 51,200 strike (17.64 lakh contracts) and the 51,300 strike (16.8 lakh contracts), while there was hardly any unwinding seen.  6) Bank Nifty Put Options Data On the Put side, the 50,000 strike holds the maximum open interest (with 15.14 lakh contracts), which can act as a key support level for the index.

The maximum Put writing was observed at the 50,500 strike (which added 3.8 lakh contracts), followed by the 49,700 strike (2.14 lakh contracts) and the 49,500 strike (1.95 lakh contracts), while the Put unwinding was seen at the 51,500 strike, which shed 7.96 lakh contracts, followed by the 51,400 and 50,700 strikes, which shed 3.43 lakh and 1.91 lakh contracts, respectively.  7) Funds Flow (Rs crore)  8) Put-Call Ratio The Nifty Put-Call ratio (PCR), which indicates the mood of the market, plunged to 0.92 on September 6, from 1.33 levels in the previous session. The increasing PCR, or being higher than 0.7 or surpassing 1, means traders are selling more Put options than Call options, which generally indicates the firming up of a bullish sentiment in the market. If the ratio falls below 0.7 or moves towards 0.5, then it indicates selling in Calls is higher than selling in Puts, reflecting a bearish mood in the market.  9) India VIX Volatility jumped sharply on Friday, climbing above the 15 mark and making the bulls uncomfortable. If it sustains above the 15 level, then bulls need to be cautious. The India VIX, the fear index, rose by 7.11 percent to 15.22, up from 14.2 levels.  10) Long Build-up (6 Stocks) A long build-up was seen in 6 stocks. An increase in open interest (OI) and price indicates a build-up of long positions.  11) Long Unwinding (92 Stocks) 92 stocks saw a decline in open interest (OI) along with a fall in price, indicating long unwinding.  12) Short Build-up (70 Stocks) 70 stocks saw an increase in OI along with a fall in price, indicating a build-up of short positions.  13) Short-Covering (16 Stocks) 16 stocks saw short-covering, meaning a decrease in OI, along with a price increase.  14) High Delivery Trades Here are the stocks that saw a high share of delivery trades. A high share of delivery reflects investing (as opposed to trading) interest in a stock.  15) Stocks Under F&O Ban Securities banned under the F&O segment include companies where derivative contracts cross 95 percent of the market-wide position limit.

"Stockology: Wait for the bounce to exit, markets may close in the positive by the end of the week",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/stockology-wait-for-the-bounce-to-exit-markets-may-close-in-the-positive-by-the-end-of-the-week-12816895.html,Market," September 08, 2024 / 13:30   ","Stockology is a weekly column by futurologist Mahesh Gowande. He is the Founder and Director of Ayan Analytics, which has developed ZodiacAnalyst, a research software with time and price charting tools. Read previous columns here ReviewAs expected, slowly and steadily, the markets have started showing signs of a short-term bearish trend. Frontline PSUÂ andÂ defence stocks have corrected and they could decline further. The need forÂ a defensive investment strategy is clear, and a lot of new investment is flowing towards stable businesses like FMCG, pharma, and tech. Last Friday's single-candle fall is going to hurt investors big time. The way in which action has suddenly picked up in the microcap space is clearly an indication of trend reversal in the coming few days. Technical The lastÂ three days of the previous week clearlyÂ showed signs of a short-term price correctionÂ of 4 to 7 percent, andÂ six toÂ eight months of time correction. Most sector leaders have given a clearÂ  sell signal. The euphoric defence sector has already seen a big correction of more than 15 percent in many scrips. PSUs, which have been in a speculative mode, have also emitted sell signals and a deep correction cannot be ruled out. After reaching new highs, there was a lack of follow-up buying, and the markets dropped below the low of August 26th within three trading sessions. The recommended strategy now is to sell on any price increases, especially if previous stop levels have been broken. The other technical levels mentioned last week remain the same. Now buying is expected in the 24,530-23,450 zone. Time mapCurrently, the sun is transiting nakshatra PurvaÂ which is ruled by Venus,Â and giving an opportunity to book profits and reduce exposure. In loss-making positions, current bounce levels can be used to book lossesÂ and stop further bleeding. Once the sun ingresses nakshatra Uttara, the fall willÂ  pick up pace and that will extend losses, making things worse. So wherever selling has been triggered, ensure you get out early. There areÂ sixÂ solar weeks in a year when volatility expands or contracts suddenly, creatingÂ nice trading opportunities. Auto and defence are likely to fall further. Most metals will also fall. Cement stocksÂ are showing signs of bottoming out. But the time map is positive forÂ  banks and insurance stocks. On 12th sun 90 Jupiter is an important aspect, and from the next day theÂ sun will ingress Uttara, which means that divergence indicators will give the best results and a lot of money can be made in the next 30 days. Jupiter is the planet that rules momentum, so fallingÂ  stocks will pick upÂ pace,Â hence be careful with the stops. But there's noÂ reason to panic as the markets will close in the positive in the current week, so wait for the bounce to exit. September 09, 2024: Monday: S.6: Vishakha: bad day. There could be a slightly higher opening and some stocks will bounce. Exiting or reducing exposure is recommended. BTST (buy today, sell tomorrow) is indicated.

Bank of America allegedly shared non-public information with investors in India: WSJ Report,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bank-of-america-allegedly-shared-non-public-information-with-investors-in-india-wsj-reports-12816873.html,Market," September 08, 2024 / 13:06   ","Bank of America is probing allegations of insider trading in its Asian operations, where bankers allegedly leaked nonpublic information to investors ahead of major stock sales worth hundreds of millions of dollars, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing whistleblower complaints. The report further stated that Bank of America has opened an internal investigation after the whistleblower complaint was made in June. The complaint alleged that bankers shared transaction details with investors before a stock sale in India was announced this spring, according to a copy of the complaint reviewed by The Wall Street Journal — potentially enabling the investors to engage “front-running”. The report further stated that the complaint was also shared with the markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and the head of investment banking for Bank of America in Asia back in June. Front-running is an illegal practice, where an entity trade based on advanced information from a stockbroker or analyst before the information has been made available to clients. According to the report, investment bankers contacted investors through WhatsApp to share transaction details before the stake sale was announced in India. It further alleged that the stake sale in question was worth $200 million and related to an arm of the Aditya Birla Group and Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC. Similar practices for other companies raised by whistleblowers included around $500 million IPO for SoftBank-backed FirstCry and a $300 million rights offering for PNB Housing Finance. The WSJ report also alleged that company records showed that ahead of the $200 million public sale of stock for Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, the investment bankers conducted meetings with investors including quantitative-trading firm Jane Street, Norges Bank and life-insurance company HDFC Life. The stake sale was made public of March 18 and executed around March 20. On March 18, Aditya Birla Capital and Sun Life (India) AMC Investments—the promoters of the fund house, had approved a stake sale of 2.01 crore shares, making up 7 percent equity in the company. The stake sale also came with the option to offload another 1.28 crore shares, representing a 4.47 percent equity. Through the oversubscription option, the promoters aimed to unload 11.47 percent equity in the AMC company. Meanwhile, Bank of America refuted the claims as a report by Reuters stated that a spokesperson told it had found no evidence to support these claims. “We take complaints seriously and thoroughly investigate them,” the spokesperson said. “In instances where we conclude there has been inappropriate behaviour, we take disciplinary action.”

From here on, the market may be very volatile around US elections, he feels. Among sectors, Amit, who has over 14 years of experience in the Indian Banking & Financial Services Industry, is bullish on the PSU banks and very few PSUs at today's prices. On the Ola Electric Mobility, he is cautious at current valuations. ""While some brokerages see potential upside, the current high valuation coupled with significant volatility suggests caution for new investors."" Do you see the chances of continuation of major upside in the equity market than major downside in coming months? What are the key triggers? In my last interview on 18th August, 2023 with Money Control I said that Nifty will touch 25,000 which is now a reality. In the last 1 year, Nifty has given 27 percent return which is a fantastic performance by all standards. In the last 1 year, the Indian stock market has outpaced all other global stock markets in the world. However, now after accomplishing our target of Nifty @ 25,000. We are taking a cautious approach for the Nifty and broader market for at least next 6 months. From here on, the market may be very volatile around US elections which may create opportunities for fresh investment for medium to long term investors. Do you see the big flow of IPOs (mainboard) in coming months considering the healthy equity market conditions? With the Nifty 50 and Sensex reaching record highs, the Indian equity markets are poised for a surge in mainboard IPOs in the coming quarters. High-profile companies, such as Bajaj Housing Finance and Hyundai Motor India, are launching their IPOs soon. The successful listing of recent IPOs has demonstrated strong investor appetite. The market's ability to absorb a significant number of IPOs remains to be seen. Are you taking a cautious approach while investing in SME IPOs? Yes, Indeed. Although investors have made a lot of money in the SME IPOs. We hold a cautious view on SME IPOs. Only after thorough analysis, people should make a decision of applying in these SME IPOs. We have been noticing a huge up-trend in them. When allocating the investments of our Global Family Offices, we make sure that the companies that we invest in are always fundamentally strong with an upside on the growth prospect. Which are the sectors on your radar for investment now? As we are expecting a market correction in both the Global and Indian Stock Markets, we have identified particular sectors and even in those sectors we are bullish on very specific stocks. This is because unlike the bull run we have witnessed in the first half of the year is a thing of the past and only very specific stocks will be generating alpha going forward. With the current market situation, I am bullish on the PSU Banks and very few PSUs at today's prices. From the index, I like Bank of Baroda, Bank Of India at current levels. Your take on Bajaj Housing Finance IPO? Bajaj Housing Finance's upcoming IPO presents a compelling opportunity, but it warrants a cautious approach. As a subsidiary of Bajaj Finance, it benefits from a robust brand reputation and strong backing. The company has a solid track record of profitability, low delinquency rates, and a diverse loan portfolio, which enhances its appeal in the growing housing finance sector. However, potential investors should consider risks such as rising interest rates and competitive pricing. The IPO's size of Rs 6,560 crore indicates significant market interest, but careful analysis of its financial health and market conditions is essential to make an informed investment decision. Do you think Ola is still an overvalued stock? Ola Electric's stock seems overvalued, especially after its recent surge, which has seen it trading at a valuation higher than Tesla. Despite a 107 percent increase from its IPO price, the company's market capitalization reached approximately Rs 55,000 crore, while it reported widening losses of Rs 347 crore in the last quarter. We are cautious on this stock at current valuations. While some brokerages see potential upside, the current high valuation coupled with significant volatility suggests caution for new investors.

The Bank Nifty dropped 896.20 points to 50,576.85. On the NSE, 1,783 shares declined, while 629 shares advanced. Nifty Outlook and Strategy Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst - Technical & Derivative Research, Angel One Nifty has tested the 20 DEMA and the bullish runaway gap on the daily chart, signifying the strong momentum in the correction. However, it is important to view this profit booking as a healthy component in a predominantly upward trend; this allows for a cooling down of elevated valuations and technical parameters, bringing them to a more comfortable level. On the level-specific front, the 25000 mark now seems to be a critical resistance zone, and an authoritative breakthrough could only bring back the positive momentum in the Nifty. On the other hand, the negative crossover on the technical indicators suggests a potential continuation of profit-taking; 24600-24500 is likely to serve as a positional support level for the benchmark in the upcoming week.

The index has now decisively broken below the 50,800-50,900 zone, which we highlighted in our previous commentaries as the immediate target following a breach of the 51,300-51,200 zone. Moving forward, a probe of the prior swing lows in the 49,700-49,650 band seems highly likely, and a break below this level could further intensify the prevailing weakness.

Moneycontrol Pro Weekender: Fairy Tale Economics,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/dnp-moneycontrol-pro-weekender-12816357.html,Market," September 07, 2024 / 10:01   ","Dear Reader, The September issue of the IMF’s Finance and Development magazine has an article titled, intriguingly, ‘Fairy Dust’s Economic Possibilities’ by Zachary Carter, a scholar with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The reference to fairies comes from Lord Keynes’ speech at the inaugural meeting of the World Bank and IMF, at Savannah in the US, in March 1946. Keynes, fresh from a performance of Tchaikovsky’s ballet ‘Sleeping Beauty’, said he hoped the Bretton Woods twins, Master Fund and Miss Bank, would receive three gifts from their fairy godmothers: first, a many-coloured coat “as a perpetual reminder that they belong to the whole world”; second, vitamins for “energy and a fearless spirit, which does not shelve and avoid difficult issues, but welcomes them and is determined to solve them”; third, “a spirit of wisdom… so that their approach to every problem is absolutely objective”. Carter writes that Keynes celebrated the co-operation among nations at Bretton Woods as a ‘’victory for the human spirit’’. He quotes Keynes, who told the conference that, “We have been learning to work together. …If we can so continue, this nightmare, in which most of us here present have spent too much of our lives, will be over. The brotherhood of man will have become more than a phrase.” After the horrors of the Second World War, a longing for the brotherhood of man was inevitable. But the Soviet Union did not sign the Bretton Woods agreement and within a few years, the Korean War had broken out, putting an end to such fond hopes. To be honest, though, Keynes also warned the delegates that “there is scarcely any enduringly successful experience yet of an international body which has fulfilled the hopes of its progenitors”. And he went on to say, again referring to the Sleeping Beauty tale, that he hoped “there is no malicious fairy, no Carabosse, whom he has overlooked and forgotten to ask to the party. For if so the curses which that bad fairy will pronounce will, I feel sure, run as follows: “You two brats shall grow up politicians; your every thought and act should have an arrière-pensée; everything you determine shall not be for its own sake or on its own merits but because of something else.’’ Keynes had tasted defeat at the Bretton Woods conference, where all his proposals were shot down by the Americans, who were intent on ensuring US hegemony through the almighty dollar. Indeed, Robert Skidelsky, in his book on Keynes, wrote, “Frederic Vinson, the US Secretary of the Treasury, took it personally. ‘I don’t mind being called malicious, but I do mind being called a fairy,’ he growled.” Why bring up Bretton Woods now? The answer perhaps lies in another article in this month’s ‘Finance & Development’ magazine, by former British prime minister Gordon Brown. He writes, “Global challenges that require global solutions are ever present, whether a changing climate or rising cyber threats. And just as we are facing these challenges, the three pillars of the post–Cold War era anchoring the global system—unipolarity, hyperglobalisation, and neoliberal economics—are collapsing around us. These seismic shifts are sowing the seeds of a new wave of populist nationalism exemplified by the “America First”, “Russia First”, “India First”, “China First”, and often “my country first and only” movements springing up round the world.’’ We have moved a long way from the spirit of the Bretton Woods conference and are back to the beggar-thy-neighbour protectionist policies of the period between the World Wars. But many would question the assumption that the Bretton Woods institutions were anything other than an extension of US power. The IMF’s forcing of austerity down the throats of nations in trouble has come in for much criticism. Indeed, as Carter writes, “Keynes’s greatest fear for the Fund and the Bank… was that the “twins” would become instruments of US power rather than truly independent international bodies’’. As US economist Benn Steil shows in his book, ‘The Battle of Bretton Woods’, far from being an embodiment of the human spirit, the Bretton Woods conference was full of intrigue, acrimony and rivalry, and it contains a wealth of anecdotes and quotes, some of which have been reproduced here. For example, Keynes had remarked to British economist Richard Kahn at the Savannah meeting: “The Americans have no idea how to make these institutions into operating international concerns,…  and in almost every direction their ideas are bad. Yet. they plainly intend to force their own conceptions on the rest of us. The result is that the institutions look like becoming American concerns, run by gigantic American staffs, with the rest of us very much on the side-lines.” In a lecture delivered at the London School of Economics, Paul Bareau, a member of the British Treasury delegation to Washington, asserted that Keynes said, “I went to Savannah to meet the world, and all I met was a tyrant.” And in a letter to the Foreign Office, Keynes said they had to sign the Bretton Woods agreement without reading it because their hosts had made arrangements to throw them out of the hotel. Brotherhood of man, indeed! Keynes also detested Harry Dexter White, the leader of the US team at Bretton Woods and most of the other Americans there. Perhaps most scathing was this remark about Mariner Eccles, the Fed chairman: “No wonder that man is a Mormon. No single woman could stand him.” Nope, Bretton Woods was not about idealism or the spirit of brotherhood. The twin institutions were to be the instruments of US power and the US view was bulldozed through. Paul Bareau said, “We [the British] lost on every issue, not by the process of rational argument in debate but by the solid massing of the cohorts which voted automatically with America, [particularly the Latin Americans,] whose representatives could be depended on to read sometimes with considerable difficulty the speeches prepared for them by the Secretariat of the United States delegation.” The simple fact is that in Bretton Woods, the US prepared the ground to take over Britain’s role as the world’s greatest power. US historian John Morton Blum wrote: “Congress was spontaneously more generous towards China than towards England, perhaps because no one envisaged China as a postwar rival for power or commerce.” The wheel has turned full circle and China is now America’s bete noire, just as Japan had become in the eighties. Keynes died within a month of the Savannah meeting, at the early age of 62. The irony was that his American rival at Bretton Woods, Harry Dexter White, was later accused of being a Soviet agent. In August 1948, two days after testifying before the House Un-American Activities Committee, where he denied being a Communist, he died of a heart attack, aged 55. It is time for soberly facing up to reality, to realise that the world has become a far more dangerous place, to acknowledge that the rules of the game have changed. Instead, the markets are ignoring the increase in risks, preferring to believe in fairy dust. As this FT story tells us, “The medium-term future for globalisation seems set: a struggle between Washington and Beijing for pre-eminence, or at least resilience, which continually threatens to override economic efficiency with national security.’’ Gordon Brown, in his Finance and Development article, says “a power-based order is replacing a rules-based order’’. This is not a time for fairy tales.

Nvidiaâ€™s $406 billion drop this week makes Bitcoin look calm,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nvidias-406-billion-drop-this-week-makes-bitcoin-look-calm-12816489.html,Market," September 07, 2024 / 06:58   ","Nvidia Corp. wiped out about $406 billion in value this week, weighing on key equity benchmarks as jitters spread over the health of the US economy and an AI trade that may have gotten ahead of itself. The world’s largest artificial-intelligence chipmaker shed a fifth of its value over the past two weeks. The declines also showcase a more pressing issue for investors in the $2.5 trillion giant: Its volatility now dwarfs its Magnificent Seven peers and makes Bitcoin look like a port of calm. Nvidia shares have swung between $90.69 and $131.26 over the past 30 trading days, with a record amount of market value being wiped out Tuesday. That level of gyration drove its 30-day realized volatility up to about 80 — roughly four times the level of Microsoft Corp., double Bitcoin’s figure and higher than meme stocks like Donald Trump’s media company and Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc.  The stumble has pushed the stock to its worst two-week stretch in two years, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The declines came after a tepid forecast and issues for its Blackwell chip, which dented investor euphoria. Then came news that the US Justice Department sent subpoenas in an escalating antitrust probe. Adding to the gloom for chipmakers broadly, Broadcom Inc. released a disappointing sales forecast. “You’re just in a very difficult market environment right this second,” said Rhys Williams, chief strategist at Wayve Capital Management LLC, adding that the AI trade is still in its early days. Still, “on a day-to-day basis, where the bottom is, is anybody’s guess.” Rewarding Year Of course, the stock has rewarded investors handsomely this year, even with the recent slide. The shares are still up more than 100% this year, adding $1.3 trillion in market value. And Wall Street roundly expects that Nvidia remains well positioned as companies build out infrastructure related to AI, a process that’s expected to last for several more quarters at least. Nvidia’s biggest customers — notably Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc., and Amazon.com Inc., which together comprise more than 40% of Nvidia’s revenue, data compiled by Bloomberg show — affirmed their spending plans in their most recent quarters. Nvidia’s results last week confirmed this rosy view. Revenue more than doubled and came in better than expected, as did adjusted earnings. The company also gave a revenue forecast that beat the analyst consensus, though it failed to meet the high end of estimates.  That result underwhelmed market participants who had grown accustomed to blowout reports. It also fed into concerns for those who are skeptical about the long-term outlook for spending on AI. It all means that as investors digest the evolution of the AI theme, the volatility in shares of Nvidia and other chipmakers will likely persist. For money managers who want to get in for the long haul, that could spell opportunity. “For a long-term investor, this is a good time to start picking away,” said Williams at Wayve Capital. “If somebody handed me new money today, I would be enthusiastically adding some AI-related stocks.”

Wall Street falls sharply to close its worst week in nearly 18 months,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/wall-street-falls-sharply-to-close-its-worst-week-in-nearly-18-months-12816488.html,Market," September 07, 2024 / 06:47   ","Another rout hit Wall Street Friday, with formerly high-flying technology stocks again taking the brunt, after a highly anticipated update on the US job market came in weak enough to add to worries about the economy. The S& P 500 dropped 1.7 per cent to close out its worst week since March 2023. Broadcom, Nvidia and other tech companies drove the market lower amid ongoing concerns that their prices soared too high in the boom around artificial intelligence, and they dragged the Nasdaq composite down by a market-leading 2.6 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 410 points, or 1 per cent, after erasing a morning gain of 250 points. Sharp swings also hit the bond market, where Treasury yields tumbled, recovered and then fell again after the jobs report showed US employers hired fewer workers in August than economists expected. It was billed as the most important jobs report of the year, and it showed a second straight month where hiring came in below forecasts. It also followed recent reports showing weakness in manufacturing and some other areas in the economy. Such a softening of the job market is actually just what the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, have been trying to get in order to stifle high inflation, ""but only to a certain extent and the data is now testing Chair Powell's stated limits,"" said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Friday's data raised questions about how much the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate by at its meeting later this month. The Fed is about to turn its focus more toward protecting the job market and preventing a recession after keeping the federal funds rate at a two-decade high for more than a year. Cuts to interest rates can boost investment prices, but the worry on Wall Street is that the Fed may be moving too late. If a recession does hit, it would undercut corporate profits and erase the benefits from lower rates. ""All is not well with the labour market,"" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. ""The Fed wanted the labour market to come into better balance, but any balancing act is unstable."" Still, the jobs report did include some encouraging data points. For one, the unemployment rate improved to 4.2 per cent from 4.3 per cent a month earlier. That was better than economists expected. And even if August's hiring was weaker than forecast, it was still better than July's pace. Christopher Waller, a member of the Fed's board of governors, said in a speech after the jobs report's release that ""I believe we should be data dependent, but not overreact to any data point, including the latest data."" ""While the labour market has clearly cooled, based on the evidence I see, I do not believe the economy is in a recession or necessarily headed for one soon,"" he said. While Waller said he thinks a ""series of reductions"" to rates is appropriate given that a slowing job market now looks like the bigger threat for the economy than high inflation, he said the ultimate pace and depth of those cuts is still to be determined. All the uncertainty sent Treasury yields on a wild ride in the bond market as traders tried to handicap the Fed's next moves. The two-year Treasury yield initially fell as low as 3.64 per cent after the release of the jobs report, before quickly climbing back above 3.76 per cent. It then dropped back to 3.66 per cent following Waller's comments, down from 3.74 per cent late Thursday. Wells Fargo Investment Institute's Wren said he was surprised by the size of markets' swings. While data has clearly shown a slowdown in the economy, he's still forecasting growth to continue, ""and it's not the end of the world"". He cautioned investors against panicking and selling their investments in knee-jerk reactions. Despite its dismal week, the S& P 500 remains just 4.6 per cent below its all-time high set in July. It's also still up 13.4 per cent for 2024 so far, which counts as a good year. A big reason for Friday's sharp drops was weakness for some big tech stocks that had been benefiting from the AI boom. Broadcom tumbled 10.4 per cent despite reporting profit and revenue for the latest quarter that were above analysts' forecasts, thanks in part to AI. The chip company said it expects to make $14 billion in revenue this quarter, which was slightly below analysts' expectations of $14.11 billion, according to FactSet. Its stock sank 15.9 per cent for the week. Other chip companies also fell Friday, including a 4.1 per cent drop for Nvidia. After soaring earlier this year as its revenue surged on the AI frenzy, Nvidia's stock has been shaky since mid-July as investors question whether they took it too high. Because of its massive size, Nvidia's stock is one of the most influential on Wall Street, and it fell 13.9 per cent over the week. That's even though Nvidia has continued to top analysts' expectations for growth. On the winning side of Wall Street was US Steel, which rose 4.3 per cent after the CEO of rival Cleveland Cliffs told MSNBC that his company would still be interested in acquiring US Steel if the White House were to block its proposed sale to Japan's Nippon Steel. All told, the S&P 500 fell 94.99 points to 5,408.42. The Dow dropped 410.34 to 40,345.41, and the Nasdaq composite lost 436.83 to 16,690.83. In stock markets abroad, indexes fell across much of Europe and Asia. Trading was halted in Hong Kong because of a typhoon.

According to him, the two-wheeler segment benefits from favourable demand dynamics and market conditions. As far as top bets are concerned, he remains positive on consumer-related stocks. Additionally, he holds a positive view on export-oriented sectors such as IT and pharmaceuticals, said the seasoned investment professional with 16 years of extensive experience managing diverse investment portfolios. Do you see interesting opportunities in banks & lenders space? The financial sector has relatively underperformed compared to the broader market, yet recent quarterly results indicate strong earnings growth across most segments, except for public sector banks. Given the sector's strong fundamentals and reasonable valuation levels, there is a distinct possibility of outperformance in the next 12 months. However, slowing credit growth, relatively weak deposit growth, potential asset-liability mismatches, and a likely increase in non-performing assets may temper earnings growth for banks and other financial institutions. Consequently, expecting most of the financial sector may perform in line with the market over the next year. Our outlook is positive on asset management, insurance, and wealth management firms. Is the two-wheeler space looking relatively better compared to commercial and passenger vehicles? Yes, the two-wheeler segment has significantly outperformed the commercial and passenger vehicle sectors in recent months, both in terms of fundamental performance and price appreciation. This trend is expected to continue in the near future, as the two-wheeler segment benefits from favourable demand dynamics and market conditions. Your top bets among sectors and why? Despite a mixed performance across consumption-driven sectors in the April-June 2024 quarter results (Source: NSE) â€”with autos and durables showing growth while FMCG and retail underperformedâ€”remaining positive on consumer-related stocks. In contrast, investment-related sectors such as capital goods, construction, real estate, and cement are fundamentally strong but appear to have built-in high expectations in both earnings and valuations. Additionally, holding a positive view on export-oriented sectors such as IT and pharmaceuticals. Should one keep accumulating pharma space? I have a positive outlook on the healthcare sector. However, given the significant differentiation in business models and product lines within the pharma space, a top-down investment approach is challenging. Do you expect SIP inflow to equity market remain unstoppable? While nothing in life or the stock market is unstoppable, there are compelling reasons to believe that SIP inflows into equity mutual funds in India may continue robustly. First, despite market volatility, SIP inflows have been rising steadily since 2016, indicating that Indian households recognize the value of systematic, long-term equity investment as a wealth creation tool. This growing financial literacy is likely to sustain SIP flows in the coming years. Second, while equity allocations have increased, the proportion of equity-linked instruments in Indian household portfolios remains around 15 percent (Source: RBI), just half the global average. As Indian portfolios align more closely with global norms, expect equity allocations to rise, further boosting SIP inflows. Bank deposits still account for more than double the share of equities in household portfolios. With rising financial awareness, anticipate a continued shift toward equities, which may keep SIP flows strong.

Sanlam eyes India wealth management foray with Shriram Capital Group,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sanlam-eyes-india-wealth-management-foray-with-shriram-capital-group-12816383.html,Market," September 06, 2024 / 18:37   ","Sanlam Ltd. is joining the race to enter India’s burgeoning asset- and wealth-management industry as Africa’s biggest insurer by market value seeks to tap opportunities in the world’s fastest-growing major economy. The insurer plans to build out its partnership with Shriram Capital Group in the South Asian nation by adding an equal joint venture covering wealth and advice services, doubling down on an initial 2005 investment that has already delivered results in the credit and insurance spaces. “A large number of people are breaking out of the real poverty trap, so they’re able to start focusing on providing for the future,” Sanlam Chief Executive Officer Paul Hanratty said in an interview Thursday. “India is really at that point where a huge chunk of the population are now able to save and invest for the future.” The International Monetary Fund expects India’s $3.9 trillion economy to expand 6.8% this year. That compares with a forecast for 0.9% growth for South Africa, Sanlam’s home market. The South Asian nation is expected to generate $730 billion of wealth through 2028, according to Boston Consulting Group, and that’s enticing firms including HSBC Holdings Plc and Barclays Plc to expand. State Bank of India, which has more than 22,500 branches in the country, is deploying 2,000 bankers to woo the rich. Blackrock Inc., the world’s biggest fund manager, in April signed an equal joint venture with billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Jio Financial Services Ltd. to set up a wealth-management business and also form a brokerage company in India. The two entities formed a joint venture to set up an Indian asset-management business in July 2023. “That’s a very hot area in India — everybody’s trying to get into it and we are very well positioned to start up,” Hanratty said. “We’ve got a huge distribution footprint, so we’ve just got to get the business and the proposition right, and then just gradually start growing it into our existing basis of branches and customers.” For the six months ended June 30, Sanlam’s India business generated about 16% of profit, up from 10% in 2021. The insurer said headline earnings climbed 43% in the period from a year earlier, buoyed by gains in life and health insurance, a surge in general insurance, and a recovery in investment management. The so-called net result from financial services — the company’s preferred profit measure — rose 19% per share. “The operating environment has been a little bit better in the first half of 2024,” Hanratty said, citing the successful conclusion of South Africa’s elections in May, where the inability to produce an outright winner saw the African National Congress — which has ruled the country since 1994 — establish a multiparty government with nine other entities. A turnaround at general-insurance unit Santam Ltd., and a strong performance in its African operations that include a joint venture with Germany’s Allianz SE, also boosted earnings.” Sanlam took a 910 million-rand impairment on AfroCentric Investment Corp., a South African health-administration company in which it holds a majority stake.

For the week, BSE Sensex and Nifty50 indices shed 1.5 percent each. Biggest Nifty losers included SBI, HCL Technologies, NTPC, ICICI Bank and BPCL, while gainers were Asian Paints, JSW Steel, Bajaj Finance, LTIMindtree and Divis Labs.

Click to view full list Outlook for September 9 Jatin Gedia â€“ Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas Nifty opened on a flat note and witnessed a sharp decline. It closed in the red down ~280 points. On the daily charts we can observe that the Nifty on account of the fall has reached the crucial support zone 24850 â€“ 24800 which coincides with the 20-day moving average and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. We expect the Nifty to hold on to this support zone and hence shall continue to maintain our short-term positive stance on the Nifty. The immediate hurdle is placed at 25000. The Banking sector led the fall in todayâ€™s trading session. It has decisively closed below the short-term averages and the daily momentum indicator has a negative crossover which is a sell signal. Thus, pullback is likely to get sold into. In terms of levels, 50800 â€“ 50949 shall act as an immediate hurdle zone while 50000 â€“ 49700 is the crucial support zone from short term perspective. Ajit Mishra â€“ SVP, Research, Religare Broking On Friday, markets came under pressure and closed over a percent lower, weighed down by weak global cues. After a flat start, the Nifty gradually declined throughout the day, breaking multiple support levels to end at 24,852.15. The sell-off was broad-based, with the banking and energy sectors taking the biggest hit. Broader indices also saw declines, losing more than a percent each. The recent weakness in US markets has stalled the momentum in Indian markets, causing participants to become cautious ahead of the upcoming jobs data. With the Nifty slipping below the crucial 20-day exponential moving average (DEMA), further downside is likely, with key support around 24,500 at the 50 DEMA. Given the circumstances, it is advisable to avoid taking aggressive positions and to apply strict stop losses on existing trades.

Click to view full list Outlook for September 9 Jatin Gedia â€“ Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas Nifty opened on a flat note and witnessed a sharp decline. It closed in the red down ~280 points. On the daily charts we can observe that the Nifty on account of the fall has reached the crucial support zone 24850 â€“ 24800 which coincides with the 20-day moving average and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. We expect the Nifty to hold on to this support zone and hence shall continue to maintain our short-term positive stance on the Nifty. The immediate hurdle is placed at 25000. The Banking sector led the fall in todayâ€™s trading session. It has decisively closed below the short-term averages and the daily momentum indicator has a negative crossover which is a sell signal. Thus, pullback is likely to get sold into. In terms of levels, 50800 â€“ 50949 shall act as an immediate hurdle zone while 50000 â€“ 49700 is the crucial support zone from short term perspective. Ajit Mishra â€“ SVP, Research, Religare Broking On Friday, markets came under pressure and closed over a percent lower, weighed down by weak global cues. After a flat start, the Nifty gradually declined throughout the day, breaking multiple support levels to end at 24,852.15. The sell-off was broad-based, with the banking and energy sectors taking the biggest hit. Broader indices also saw declines, losing more than a percent each. The recent weakness in US markets has stalled the momentum in Indian markets, causing participants to become cautious ahead of the upcoming jobs data. With the Nifty slipping below the crucial 20-day exponential moving average (DEMA), further downside is likely, with key support around 24,500 at the 50 DEMA. Given the circumstances, it is advisable to avoid taking aggressive positions and to apply strict stop losses on existing trades.

Twelve IPOs will compete to raise over $1 billion next week,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/twelve-ipos-will-compete-to-raise-over-1-billion-in-a-single-week-12815780.html,Stocks," September 06, 2024 / 18:02   ","India's primary market is set for a busy next week, with 12 companies—four main board listings and eight SME issuances—aiming to raise more than Rs 8,600 crore ($1 billion) as they seek to take advantage of favourable investor sentiment. Among the main board IPOs, the four firms that will vie for investor attention are Bajaj Housing Finance, which will raise around Rs 6,560 crore, Tolins Tyres (Rs 230 crore), Kross Ltd (Rs 500 crore) and P N Gadgil Jewellers (Rs 1,100 crore). Another main board IPO, Western Carriers India, is likely to open soon though the company has yet to disclose a specific timeline for the offering. While Bajaj Housing Finance, Tolins Tyres and Kross Ltd will open for subscription on September 9 and close on September 11, P N Gadgil Jeweller IPO will open on September 10 and close on September 12.  Apurva Sheth, Head of Market Perspectives and Research at SAMCO Securities, highlights several factors driving the positive trend in India's primary market. The current market buoyancy is fueled by broad investor participation with retail investors eager to capitalise on attractive listing gains, spurred by the strong performance of the secondary market -- Nifty is up 15.71 percent in the current calendar year till date. Additionally, robust liquidity among both domestic and foreign institutional investors has significantly bolstered the IPO market pipeline. Incidentally, the grey market premiums (GMP) for these firms are also surging. Bajaj Housing Finance GMP is trading at Rs 51 a share, up 73 percent from its upper end price band of Rs 70 a share, Tolins Tyres GMP is trading 12 percent higher while P N Gadgil Jewellers IPO is trading over 37 percent higher. Among SME IPOs, four companies -- Gajanand International, Share Samadhan, Shubhshree Biofuels Energy and Aditya Ultra Steel -- will open for subscription on September 9 and close on September 11. Two firms -- Trafiksol ITS Technologies, SPP Polymer -- will open on September 10 and close on September 13 while another two -- Innomet Advanced Materials and Excellent Wires & Packaging -- will open on September 11 and close on September 13. These firms will raise between Rs 12-45 crore each through their public issues. The recent past has seen IPOs attracting huge subscriptions. Among main board IPOs in August, the average subscription was over 75 times, while the average for 2024 so far stands at 66 times. For SME IPOs, the average subscription in August reached 290 times, with a year-to-date average of over 259 times. The strong subscription across IPOs has been driven by robust participation from retail, institutional, and foreign investors. Data from NSDL shows that while foreign investors have been net sellers in secondary markets, they have consistently invested in primary markets. In August, FIIs invested around Rs 12,872 crore, and so far in CY24, their investments in primary markets have totalled around Rs54,883 crore. Analysts note that most recent IPO offerings are emerging from high-growth, sunrise sectors, thereby attracting investors anticipating strong growth potential. This trend is expected to continue through the rest of 2024 and may extend into 2025, they say. “With growing retail participation and renewed interest from FIIs, driven largely by evolving global macroeconomic conditions, the market environment seems favorable for several upcoming IPOs to finally make their debut on the bourses. The recent success of multiple listings is likely to generate even greater interest in the next wave of IPOs,” says Nirav Karkera, Head of Research at Fisdom.

Accordingly, during Apr-Augâ€™24, total production reached 290mt (+3% YoY) and dispatches stood at 308mt (+1% YoY).

US CPI in the spotlight next week as markets seek clarity on Fed's first rate cut,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/commodities/us-cpi-in-the-spotlight-next-week-as-markets-seek-clarity-on-feds-first-rate-cut-12817159.html,Commodities," September 08, 2024 / 23:13   ","By Kaynat Chainwala, AVP Commodity Research at Kotak Securities Markets ended on a weaker note as the highly anticipated US jobs report failed to provide clarity on the scale of potential rate cuts, leaving traders disappointed. The US dollar experienced significant fluctuations as moderating US inflation pushed the dollar to 101.91, followed by a sharp pullback to 100.58 as lower-than-expected private payrolls and weaker jobs openings increased bets on bigger rate cuts. Nevertheless, the mixed official jobs report left the debate over a 25 or 50 bps rate cut unresolved, helping the dollar rebound and close above 101. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 1,42,000 last month, bringing the three-month average to its lowest level since mid-2020. Meanwhile, unemployment rate decreased to 4.2 percent, marking its first decline in five months; average hourly earnings rose by 0.4 percent on a monthly basis and 3.8 percent year-over-year, surpassing estimates. This mixed data suggested both a potential slowdown in the labour market and uncertainty over the September rate cut outlook, contributing to the worst weekly losses for US equities this year during the first week of September, a historically challenging month for markets. COMEX Gold traded within a narrow range throughout the week as traders awaited the US jobs data for insights into the Federal Reserve's potential rate cut path. Gold saw a sharp rise to $2,560 per ounce on Friday before retreating and closing the week flat at $2,526.8 per ounce, while silver fell 3 percent to $28 per troy ounce, in line with the dollar's rebound following the jobs report. On the daily chart, MCX Silver December futures fell dramatically on Friday, marking the biggest daily drop (-2.59 percent) in a month. Price also closed lowest in the recent three weeks. On the weekly and daily charts, the price is trading below the 20 EMA and Supertrend (7,3), indicating a bearish bias. Price may maintain its negative momentum next week, finding initial support at Rs 80,440 per kg, which if broken and sustained, may see bears bring prices down to the next support level of Rs 79,000. On the flip side, the nearest resistance is at Rs 85,945, followed by Rs 88,350. WTI crude oil extended its losses into September and slipped to a 14-month low of $67.17 per barrel due to concerns over US and Chinese demand amid a potential resolution of the Libyan political dispute. Despite OPEC's announcement to not increase output by 180,000 barrels per day in October and November and a drop in US oil stocks to a one-year low, prices struggled to gain upward momentum. LME base metals also faced significant losses this week, driven by weak manufacturing PMI numbers from the US and China, which dented demand prospects. Additionally, disappointing new home sales data from China indicated that efforts to address the real estate downturn and boost economic activity have not been successful. Zinc led the declines, plunging 6Â percent amid ongoing issues at Chinese steel mills. Upcoming key data releases from China could add further downward pressure on crude oil and metal prices if they continue to reflect a bleak economic outlook. Cooling inflation and tepid growth have sharply increased the likelihood of a 25 basis point rate cut by the ECB in its upcoming policy meeting. However, US CPI will capture the most attention from market participants as one of the final indicators before the FOMC's rate decision on September 18, with persistent inflation potentially reducing the likelihood of a 50 basis point rate cut.
