"Sensex, Nifty hit record highs; here's a look at what's driving the rally",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-nifty-hit-record-highs-heres-a-look-at-the-key-drivers-of-the-rally-12826089.html,general," September 20, 2024 / 12:18   ","Sensex and NiftyÂ hit record highs ofÂ 84,240 andÂ 25,725 around noon on September 20 amid broad-based buying.Â The overall market capitalisation (mcap) of BSE-listed firms rose to nearly Rs 469 lakh crore. Around noon, the Sensex was up 965 points or 1.2 percent at 84,149 and the Nifty was up 290 points or 1.1 percent at 25,706. About 2,196 shares advanced, 1,071 shares declined, and 105 shares remained unchanged. Here are five factors driving the rally: 1. Global Market Optimism: Overnight, US benchmarks closed higher after the Fed cut interest rates by 50 basis points and signalled more cuts ahead. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones hit record highs, fueled by stronger-than-expected jobless claims data, boosting global risk appetite. Asia-Pacific markets were strong today, led by Japan's Nikkei 225. Japan's core consumer price index rose 2.8 percent year-on-year, ahead of the Bank of Japanâ€™s upcoming policy meeting, where rates are expected to remain steady at 0.25 percent. Follow our live blog for all the market action 2. Fed's Rate-Cutting Cycle:Â The Fed's pivot could influence the Reserve Bank of India's stance, with some analysts predicting a potential rate cut in the December policy meeting. ""This exerts pressure on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to think about a similar rate cut, especially while the domestic economy is still recovering,"" said Ravi Singh, SVP of Retail Research at Religare Broking. ""This start to the easing cycle provides some space to (emerging markets) EMs to kick-start theirs too, but with low global volatility thus far, the RBI is likely to remain focused on domestic dynamics,"" Emkay Global said in its FOMC review report. 3. Banking Stocks Lead the Charge: The Nifty Bank index rose for the seventh consecutive session and hit a fresh high of 53,357 led by gains in ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, and Kotak Mahindra which were up 1-2 percent. Banking stocks hold the maximum weight in the benchmark indices. After having declined by 1.5 percent in July and 0.4 percent in August, the index has risen over 4 percent so far in September.

Participation From Midcaps and Smallcaps:Â The broader market rebounded today after facing selling pressure in the past couple of sessions. Both the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices snapped a three-day losing run and rose by over a percentage each. 5. Expectations of Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) Buying:Â The Fed's interest rate cut is a positive factor for Indian equities as it boosts global liquidity, potentially attracting more foreign funds. ""Weakening dollar and falling interest rates in the US are generally positive for emerging markets like India. The FPIs have already started buying Indian equities in the past few weeks despite concerns about valuations. We belive resilient Indian macro should support India's equity valuation,"" saidÂ Jitendra Gohil, CFA Chief Investment Strategist, Kotak AlternateAsset Manages.

"Vodafone Idea sees no impact of SC ruling on debt-funding, capex plans",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/vodafone-idea-sees-no-impact-of-sc-ruling-on-debt-funding-capex-plans-12826002.html,general," September 20, 2024 / 12:08   ","Vodafone Idea Ltd expects its debt-raising and capital expenditure plans to remain unaffected by the Supreme Court's rejection of its curative plea for re-computation of dues it owes to the government, as lenders had accounted for an adverse outcome in their recent techno-economic evaluation, company officials said, requesting anonymity. However, analysts said that the apex court ruling could delay the telco’s debt-raising plans, hinder capex execution and lead to further market share losses. Analysts pinned their hopes on a positive AGR ruling as a “potential wildcard”, which could have improved Vodafone Idea's finances and its ability to compete with rivals. In the absence of an AGR relief, the telco could be staring at a financial crisis starting from the second half of financial year 2026 to the calendar year 2027. The time frame coincides with the company’s deadline to make its annual spectrum and AGR payments to the government, which are estimated to be up to $ 5 billion. Vodafone Idea has raised $2.4 billion in equity and is raising an additional $4 billion in debt. The telco, which has 200 million subscribers, has reached out to new lenders, including public sector non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). Telco remains hopefulA company source said, “The [SC] outcome does not impact our plan in any way. A positive outcome would have helped, but it won’t have any impact on our debt-fundraising and capex strategy.” The telco has outlined a capex plan of up to Rs 55,000 crore over three years to be executed through debt fundraising and equity raises. Vodafone Idea has earmarked a capex budget for 5G deployment and the expansion of 4G coverage in critical priority circles from the equity raise. The company claims to have sufficient funds from its recent capital raise to support its near-term capex needs. Earlier this week on September 19, the apex court dismissed curative petitions of telecom operators — led by Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel — seeking correction of computational errors related to pending AGR dues. A three-member SC bench, comprising Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud and Sanjiv Khanna, B.R. Gavai, dismissed the curation petitions. The way forward In a note, brokerage firm, Nomura, said that the AGR outcome was a material overhang on Vodafone Idea and there is an incremental visibility on the telco's way forward. Despite its large debt burden but manageable with government support in the coming years, Vodafone Idea will be able to steadily repair and rebuild its business and partake in the robust outlook for the Indian telecom industry, which is underpinned by clarity on significant tariff hikes for the next two years and 5G monetisation, Nomura said. ""The reality doesn't change for Vodafone Idea. But the debt raise will become challenging, and that will, in turn, impact its capex plan, resulting in delayed market share stabilisation and customer loss. Now, market share gain will be a much tougher task,"" an analyst associated with a leading brokerage told Moneyconytrol. The analyst said Vodafone Idea will require a capital infusion, primarily from its shareholders, unless the government extends the payment timeline. “The government should review the matter and intervene…else,  there is a risk and Vodafone Idea could be struggling. Such a scenario will not be good for the telecom sector,” said Mahesh Uppal, director, Com First (India). Uppal said the SC ruling will impact the teleco’s turnaround plan. “A positive outcome could have reduced the company’s burden,"" he added. In a note dated September 19, Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia (CLSA), a capital markets and investment group that focuses on alternative investments, said all options may not be exhausted for the telco. It cited a similar petition filed by the company in January 2021 after the SC’s AGR verdict on the 16-year-old case. Analysts at Macquarie, a global investment banking and financial services group, said though Vodafone Idea's tariff outlook has been improving, without AGR concessions, it would take at least up to 30 years at 15 per cent average revenue per user (ARPU) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the company to settle its outstanding dues. Hence, a further extension of the repayment deadline is required, it added. “In our base case, we continue to see market-share erosion and meaningful equity dilution risk,” Macquarie analysts said in a note on September 19. Based on a detailed self-assessment of AGR dues, Bharti Airtel paid $2.2 billion against the department of telecom’s (DoT) estimate of $5.3 billion. Similarly, Vodafone Idea had self-assessed AGR dues at $2.6 billion, against the DoT estimate of $7 billion. So far, the telco has paid $1 billion. Vodafone-Idea's net debt was $28 billion till the first quarter of 2024-25, including an AGR liability of $8.5 billion, of which 20 per cent is principal, and the rest represents interest and penalties. Earlier, in  September 2021, Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel had opted for a four-year moratorium on AGR and spectrum dues.

PhysicsWallah raises $210 million in funding at $2.8 billion valuation,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/physicswallah-raises-210-million-in-funding-at-2-8-billion-valuation-12826132.html,general," September 20, 2024 / 12:21   ","Edtech unicorn Physics Wallah (PW) has closed its Series B funding round, raising $210 million through a combination of primary and secondary transactions. The round, led by Hornbill Capital, saw participation from Lightspeed Venture Partners, as well as existing investors GSV Ventures and WestBridge Capital. With this investment, the company’s post-money valuation has soared to $2.8 billion, a 2.5X increase from its previous valuation of $1.1 billion. Founded by teacher-turned-entrepreneur Alakh Pandey in 2016, the profitable edtech firm had previously raised $102 million from WestBridge and GSV Ventures in its maiden funding round. The latest round marks one of the largest primary capital raises in the edtech segment in recent times, signaling a renewed investor confidence after a long interval, especially as companies transition back to traditional learning methods while incorporating digital innovations. Following a drastic decline in investment during 2023, which fell to $321 million from a peak of $4.1 billion in 2021, the current funding is a strong indicator of recovery. According to a report by Tracxn, year-to-date funding in the Indian edtech sector stood at $215 million, showing a modest rebound from the $321 million secured by edtech startups in 2023. Funding in India’s edtech ecosystem plummeted post pandemic as educational institutions reopening impacted demand for online learning coupled with the corporate governance issue and financial crisis faced by beleaguered edtech company Byju’s that hit investors’ confidence in the sector. However, despite a modest recovery, the sector still has a long gap to cover up as funding in 2023 dropped by 87 percent from $2.4 billion raised in 2022. Edtech funding had peaked at $4.1 billion in 2021.  Focus on scale  In FY23, PhysicsWallah reported a threefold increase in operating revenue, reaching Rs 772 crore on a standalone basis. This surge was primarily fueled by the company’s expansion into offline education, which now contributes approximately 45 percent of its overall revenue. In an interview with Moneycontrol, Co-founder Prateek Maheshwari shared that the edtech firm has over Rs 1,200 crore in the bank to fuel its expansion, and will utilise the fresh capital wisely to scale up. Despite the dip in profits in FY23 due to increased spending on growth, Maheshwari and Pandey remain optimistic about the future. “FY25 will be our highest absolute EBITDA year,” Pandey confidently states. He explained that their revenue has already grown 2.5x in FY24, and their strategic decision to invest in offline centres, which many doubted, is now paying off. PW's net profit saw a decline to Rs 16 crore, down from Rs 98 crore in FY22, attributed to rising employee costs and provisioning for non-cash expenses that led to a significant increase in total expenses. ""The mandate for FY24 was to capture market share, which led to a dip in profits. However, we’re confident about the long-term roadmap. For FY25, we’re targeting more than 50% growth,"" the co-founder added.  Strategic expansion With the fresh capital, PhysicsWallah plans to bolster its operations significantly. The company is aiming to establish localised education centers--Micro hubs-- to enhance accessibility for students across India, and continuing its strategy of exploring mergers with community-driven education platforms to strengthen its market position. ""Our strategy is to avoid mega centers like Kota due to the high concentration of students and associated challenges. Instead, we are focusing on smaller, efficient centers closer to students' homes. This year, we are heavily expanding in South India but will continue to grow Vidhyapeth at a strong pace with mirco hubs,"" Maheshwari said. The edtech had previously acquired smaller firms such as Xylem Learning, PrepOnline, Altis Vortex. ""We are exploring opportunities in different geographies, particularly the South. We are also seeking smaller, growing platforms, particularly led by teachers, that share our philosophy of community building and have a brand affinity similar to Physics Wallah. We are not interested in large-scale acquisitions but rather in smaller entities,"" Pandey said.

Why banking stocks will continue to struggle even if RBI follows Fed's 50 bps rate cut path,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/why-banking-stocks-will-continue-to-struggle-even-if-rbi-follows-feds-50-bps-rate-cut-path-12826104.html,general," September 20, 2024 / 11:29   ","Rate sensitive stocks tend to rejoice on easing of monetary policy, and with the US Fed announcing a jumbo rate cut of 50 basis points, it is a no brainer that banking stocks may also attract huge investor interest. However, this time, it is different. While hopes for RBI to follow steps of the Fed have increased, market experts expect the underperformance of banking stocks to continue in the near-term on account of a combination of factors including trailing margins, sluggish deposit growth, and widening credit-to-deposit (CDR) ratio. Chokkalingam G, founder of Equinomics Research, cautioned that even if the RBI cuts interest rates, banking stocks are unlikely to see relief in the near term. He highlighted factors such as increased liquidity requirements, higher provisions for credit losses, slow deposit growth, and the widening CDR ratio as ongoing challenges that will keep banking stocks under pressure. So far this year, the Bank Nifty index has risen 9 percent, significantly underperforming benchmark Nifty 50's 16 percent gains. Dnyananda Vaidya, research analyst tracking BFSI sector at Axis Securities concurred to this view, saying that a rate cut by RBI would dent lenders margins in the near-term with higher share of repo-linked loans. Repo-linked loans adjust with changes in the repo rate, potentially narrowing the gap between deposit and loan rates, thereby, squeezing bank margins. However, the Street is split on whether a rate cut by the RBI will happen this year. While some experts anticipate a small rate cut in the October meeting, most are betting on a delayed cut, likely in December or even next year. Which lender will feel the most margin pressure? If the RBI mirrors the Fed's 50 bps rate cut, large private banks like HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, and ICICI Bank are expected to see a margin impact of 15-20 bps, according to Nomura analysts. This is because 50-60 percent of their loan books are directly linked to the repo rate or external benchmarks.  Smaller private banks such as IndusInd Bank, AU Bank, and Bandhan Bank, which have a higher share of fixed-rate loans, will be less affected. Similarly, PSU banks like SBI, which has more MCLR-linked loans, will also experience less impact. Before FY20, banks didn't use repo rates or external benchmarks for floating rate loans; instead, they based lending rates on their internal benchmarks like the MCLR. In October 2019, the RBI mandated that new floating rate loans for retail and MSME sectors be linked to the repo rate or another external benchmark, making lending rates more sensitive to changes in external interest rates.  Despite the margin pressures, the overall impact on banks' return on assets (RoA) is expected to be limited, thanks to potential mark-to-market (MTM) gains from their treasury books, said Nomura. Treasury gains occur when bond prices rise after a rate cut, benefiting banks with large government bond portfolios. Large private lenders like HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, and ICICI Bank are likely to see a 5-10 bps RoA impact, while IndusInd Bank, Bandhan Bank, and AU Bank will experience minimal RoA pressure. Will deposit, CASA ratio improve with a rate cut? Historically, the CASA ratio of the banking system has improved during rate cut cycles. For example, between FY15 and FY17, the CASA ratio rose by around 600 bps, and it improved by 260 bps between FY19 and FY21. However, the RBI's aggressive monetary tightening over the past two years caused the CASA ratio to drop by about 450 bps by March 2024. A future rate cut could help the CASA ratio recover from these low levels, as each 1 percentage point increase in the CASA ratio typically boosts banks' net interest margin (NIM) by 4-5 bps, according to Nomura analysts. Deposit growth could also improve if the RBI shifts to a more accommodative policy. Nomura projects system deposit growth to rise to 13 percent year-on-year for FY25, up from around 11% as of August 9, 2024.

"'This is wrong': Vinesh Phogat suggests major change in Wrestling Rules, explains 'women can’t lose more than 3 kg in a day'",https://www.moneycontrol.com/sports/vinesh-phogat-suggests-major-change-in-wrestling-rules-explains-women-cant-lose-more-than-3-kg-in-a-day-article-12826172.html,general," September 20, 2024 / 12:25   ","Vinesh Phogat, who missed out on an assured Olympic medal due to disqualification, has a suggestion for United World Wrestling (UWW), the world wrestling body. The Indian grappler feels women should have an allowance of 1kg extra weight for the second day of the competition. She even feels that there's ""no need"" to check weight on the following day if the wrestler has reached the final of the competition. Vinesh, competing in the women's 50kg freestyle wrestling, was assured of a silver medal after reaching the finals at the recently-concluded Paris Olympics. She, however, failed to meet the weight on the morning of her final bout, measuring 100 grams over the eligibility criteria, which led to her disqualification. In a recent interaction with the Indian Express, Vinesh was asked to share her thoughts on the existing rules, to which she replied: “I think there is no need to even check the weight again of those who have reached the final. Or they should delay the weigh-in a bit on the second day so it gives more time. There needs to be an allowance, especially for women since their body structure is different from men.” As per the UWW Olympics weigh-in rules, wrestlers have to measure their weight on the morning of their competition. And before that they need to appear at medical examination with their licence and accreditation, during which the wrestler is supposed wear their singlet. The weigh-in duration for Day 1 is half hour, during which a wrestler can measure multiple times. However, if they progress to the final, the weigh-in duration reduces to 15 minutes and is conducted on the morning of the bout. Also Read: After Vinesh Phogat's 'PT Usha played politics in Paris' remark, Harish Salve reveals wrestler 'didn’t want to carry case further' “Women can’t lose more than 3 kg in a day when you are at peak fitness because your fat percent is already very low. Men wrestlers can but we cannot because our body retains water. All women athletes are concerned about the weight cut on the second day. At the Games Village, there were at least 50 athletes, from different sports, who hugged me and said that this is wrong,” Vinesh added. Meanwhile, UWW chief Nenad Lalovic had earlier stated that the body won't be revising any rules based on this one incident. He had mentioned that the strict regulations are to ensure wrestlers ""compete in their natural weight category"" and not drastically reduce weight, which may have an ""impact on their health"".

Speaking at an event on Friday where he addressed 55 victims of Naxal violence from Chhattisgarh, Shah warned that failure to comply would result in an intensified military campaign. “I appeal to Naxals to give up violence, lay down arms, and surrender as the militants in the northeast have done. If you do not listen, then an all-out operation will be carried out soon to end the menace,” Shah stated, underlining the government's resolve to eradicate the Maoist threat. Shah emphasized that the Naxal problem, which once plagued multiple regions, is now limited to just four districts of Chhattisgarh due to the success of ongoing security operations. He credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government for dismantling a larger Maoist plan to establish a ""Red Corridor"" stretching from Pashupatinath in Nepal to Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh. “That corridor was destroyed by the Modi government,” he added. Shah also declared that Maoists would “take their last breath on March 31, 2026,” affirming the government's commitment to ending both Naxal violence and its ideological influence. Additionally, Shah announced that the Ministry of Home Affairs, in collaboration with the Chhattisgarh state government, will soon develop a comprehensive welfare scheme for victims of Naxal violence. “We will help you in whatever way we can through our welfare measures in jobs, healthcare, and other areas,” he assured the affected families.

Cricketer-turned-AI engineer Saurabh Netravalkar on why data analytics is becoming core to sports,https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/from-wankhade-to-oracle-cricketer-turned-ai-engineer-saurabh-netravalkar-on-why-data-analytics-is-becoming-core-to-sports-article-12826119.html,general," September 20, 2024 / 12:03   ","Saurabh Netravalkar, an AI engineer at Oracle, got an opportunity to relive his cricketing dreams again when he was selected to play in the T20 World Cup 2024. Previously the captain of the USA national team, Netravalkar got to represent the country again on the global stage. Netravalkar's arc from being India's highest wicket taker in the 2010 Under 19 World Cup to becoming a full-time engineer in the US captured the imagination of cricket fans and techies. But Netravalkar shrugs off the interest, attributing this to the support he received from his family and his workplace. “When I was younger I had a lot of attachment towards wanting to play for team India. But through my yoga journey and education, I became more aware of the fact that you just had to do what you enjoy and love; and detach yourself from the results of those actions,” he told Moneycontrol during on the sidelines of Oracle CloudWorld Tour in Las Vegas. A rather tall, composed and calm personality off-ground, the 32-year-old left-arm fast bowler garnered a lot of attention during the recent cricketing season for taking wickets of some of the big wigs of both India and Pakistan teams. A Mumbai boy balancing it out The city that gave wings to some of the biggest cricket legends like Sachin Tendulkar and Sunil Gavaskar, was also the place where Netravalkar first started dreaming big. Born on October 16, 1991 to a cricket-enthusiast electronics engineer father and a professor (in nutrition) mother, education was a crucial part of his life growing up even as his family supported his cricket practice. A liking for the sport starts very early on in the cricket-crazy country. So like most Indian kids, Netravalkar too started playing cricket on streets and the backyards of his neighbourhood in Malad at the age of 10. Later he went on to play in Under 13, Under 15 and Under 19 teams. Playing for India was always the big dream, but he was equally passionate about Science and Technology. “My family went that extra mile to make sure that I could manage both,” he said. When his parents weren’t home his grandparents would often chip in to teach a subject or two. His grandfather for instance used to teach him History and share stories from the past. Seeing his father break apart computers and the numerous floppy drives around made him curious about technology. To balance both his studies and cricket training, the real struggle started when he had to cover the long local train journeys of Mumbai (then Bombay) to reach Churchgate every day. “After school, my mom or dad used to pick me up and we used to take the train to Churchgate. It's an hour journey from Malad. I used to do my school homework on the way. They (parents) have sacrificed a lot as well in their life for me being able to do what I'm doing now,” he said. “It was a big grind but I am glad it worked out in the end. I don't know if I go back in time if I will be able to do that again,” he added. Balancing became the theme of his quick changing career as he went on to play U-19 in New Zealand while pursuing computer engineering degree between 2009 to 2013. It was the toughest phase, he recalled. Some days he felt like giving up too but he focussed on rediscovering his love for what he was doing. In fact, he thinks the low phases helped him evaluate the choices and sacrifices he made to stick to the game better. “There are tough phases as a sportsperson, you lose more than you win. And that's the fact of life, I'd say,” he says, “But then you realise that once you ride through that, the light comes at the end of the tunnel.” While in college, Netravalkar also tried starting up along with a few of his classmates. They launched an android app called CricDeCode app, which supported grassroots-level players to analyse their performances using data. After completing his under graduation, he went on to play in U-23 team but didn't make it big. He even joined a tech job out of college in 2013, and decided to give up after the first day to focus on cricket. His parents were supportive of his plans and he dedicated the next two years to focus on the sport. “I trained hard in the offseason and got picked in the national side in the Mumbai team, played for two years for Mumbai. At the same time, I was doing online courses on Coursera to keep my coding skills updated,” he said. Not having made it to the Indian team or the IPL by 2015, he applied for higher studies in foreign universities. He got an offer from Cornell University which was one of the top institutions for computer science at that time. “At that time, I left the sport and I never expected to play again,” he said. Things changed once he moved to the US in 2016, and started playing locally with the cricket clubs. Nowadays, he is often with his laptop either coding or attending video calls with his Oracle team members in between practice. Thanks to his supportive manager, he has been able to compartmentalise his time and prioritise tasks ahead of any major tours. Meeting old colleagues During his teenage years and Under 19 training, Netravalkar used to practice with several of the current team India players including skipper Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and KL Rahul. The T20 World Cup made the players reconnect almost after a decade. Netravalkar shares his experiences meeting Yadav and later Sharma, in the Bay Area where the India captain has his own cricket academy.  “I have been playing or practicing with them since my childhood in Mumbai, it's been nice to reconnect with them…It felt really nostalgic and I am happy for them the way they have risen in their career to being one of the best in the world. I have followed their journey and it's been great that I got the opportunity to share the field with them,” Netravalkar says. He reminisced sharing the same light-hearted jokes and conversations from the dressing room in the Mumbai camp from years ago when they met at the World Cup pitch. Though they now play in rival teams, Netravalkar called this the beauty of the sport. “It felt like how old friends meet, it didn't feel like there was that much of a gap,” he says. When asked what changed over the decade in the way they played their game, Netravalkar shares that along with being better aware of their strength and weaknesses and mental abilities, cricket itself has evolved a lot to become more data analytics and strategy-driven beyond just the cricketer’s own strengths. “It’s more of a mind game now where the first time you play an opponent, yes there is some unknown factor, but if you are playing the same opponent next time you can't go with the same plan now,” he explains. Gaming strategy In the last two-three years, every professional cricket team has started having an in-house data analyst with them on tours. Before matches, teams would have detailed analysis on each player’s plan and there would be multiple such back up plans too. Parameters like the condition of the ground, the pitch, who is running in what kind of a form is closely monitored. For Netravalkar, his knowledge and experience in data, AI and coding came in handy with his cricketing skills. “Especially with the advent of AI and stuff like that you find patterns that are very subtle which you would not be able to make out usually with the human eye. If you look at the top teams, the margins are so small like you win by 5 runs, 6 runs or so -- those small cues can make a big difference,” he says. Being a techie in such a scenario does give an edge, he shares. “Because you know how the tech works, you would have an idea about what to look for in the data and analytics. The main thing is you have lot of data but if you don't know what to look for, it's really hard.” At Oracle, Netravalkar is currently a principal member of the technical staff working on Oracle Database 23ai, the technology giant’s new database technology integrating AI capabilities. Plans ahead Next up, Netravalkar is gearing up to play the 2026 ICC T20 World Cup for which USA has qualified; for the 2027 World Cup too the team will get a chance to compete in the qualifiers. He is waiting for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, where cricket is expected to be a part, that he called a huge opportunity to popularise the sport within US where it has slowly started finding new fan following. Finding a place as a World Cup qualifying team, cricket has found a sweet spot in the States. At an organisational level, cricket has grown exponentially in the country in the last 2-3 years with the advent of minor league cricket, major league cricket that started last year. “It had top players from across the globe. Season 2 of that concluded just after the world cup which was a big success. They are building new stadiums every year, so infrastructure is being built, fan following has also exponentially increased especially after the world cup,” he shares. Work life and training routine continues as he balances his twin interests. He wakes up at 6am, does his yoga and gets to work. After hitting the gym in the evening post work, he sometimes goes for a run at the park near his house. He gets extended lunch breaks for twice a week when he goes for his cricket practice. When compared to his life back in Mumbai, Netravalkar -- after giving it a few seconds of thought says -- “I think you cut down on a lot of travel time here. I live close to work and I am home at 5.30 pm basically. So I have the evening to myself.” Surely, a pain point every Mumbaikar would relate to.

It is not the KMF (Karnataka Milk Federation). After complaints, it was tested and action was initiated,” Lokesh, son of Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, said.

His comments came a day after CM Naidu revealed that animal fat was used for preparing the Tirumala temple Prasadam during the YSRC regime. The laddu is distributed at the revered Sri Venkateswara temple in Tirupati, which is run by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD). “The Lord Venkateswara Swamy Temple at Tirumala is our most sacred temple.

The top court uses the chanel to stream hearings of cases listed before Constitution Benches and matters involving public interest. The channel recently broadcasted the suo motu case related to the alleged rape and murder of a trainee doctor at Kolkata’s RG Kar Hospital. The viewers searching for recordings of the hearings found that all previous videos have been set private and replaced by a live video titled ‘Brad Garlinghouse: Ripple Responds To The SEC’s $2 Billion Fine!

"PM Modi, Joe Biden to sign 2 key pacts; no word on meeting with Donald Trump",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/pm-modi-joe-biden-to-sign-2-key-pacts-no-word-on-meeting-with-donald-trump-12826024.html,general," September 20, 2024 / 10:16   ","Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden will hold a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the Quad Leaders' Summit in Delaware on September 2 during which the two leaders are expected to sign at least two agreements, foreign secretary Vikram Misri has said. Misri briefed the media on September 19 on Modi-'s September 21-23 visit to the United States. One of the agreement would be on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), while the other will be a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on the India-US drug framework, he said. During the meeting, Modi is expected to update Biden on his recent discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv to find a peaceful resolution to the war between the two neighbours, which is in its third year now. Modi is also expected to hold bilateral meetings with Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. “This will also serve as a kind of farewell event for President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida in the context of the Quad,” Misri said. While Biden has opted out of the November presidential election, Kishida will step down later this month. When asked if Modi would meet former Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Misri was non-committal and said, “We are scheduling many meetings for the Prime Minister, and we will update you as plans are finalised.” The former US president recently said he would meet Modi during his visit. Quad Summit The Quad summit would be busy, with a leaders’ declaration expected at the end of the event. Promoting peace, prosperity, and stability in the Indo-Pacific region remain Quad's priorities, Misri said. Health security, climate change, emerging technologies, connectivity, maritime security, and counter-terrorism efforts will also feature during the talks. The highlight would be the launch of the ""Cancer Moonshot"" initiative, which aims to prevent, detect, treat, and alleviate the impact of cancer on patients and their families. The member countries will initially collaborate on reducing the burden of cervical cancer in the Indo-Pacific region, Misri said. Though India was to host the Quad summit this year, the event was moved to the US on Washington’s request. India will host the four-nation summit next year. Modi will also speak at an Indian community event in New York on September 22 and address the United Nations General Assembly on September 23. (With inputs from PTI)

Hacker uses Telegram chatbots to leak data of top Indian insurer Star Health,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/hacker-uses-telegram-chatbots-to-leak-data-of-top-indian-insurer-star-health-12826064.html,general," September 20, 2024 / 10:37   ","Stolen customer data including medical reports from India’s biggest health insurer, Star Health, is publicly accessible via chatbots on Telegram, just weeks after Telegram’s founder was accused of allowing the messenger app to facilitate crime. The purported creator of the chatbots told a security researcher, who alerted Reuters to the issue, that private details of millions of people were for sale and that samples could be viewed by asking the chatbots to divulge. Star Health and Allied Insurance, whose market capitalization exceeds $4 billion, in a statement to Reuters said it has reported alleged unauthorized data access to local authorities. It said an initial assessment showed ""no widespread compromise” and that ""sensitive customer data remains secure”. Using the chatbots, Reuters was able to download policy and claims documents featuring names, phone numbers, addresses, tax details, copies of ID cards, test results and medical diagnoses. The ability for users to create chatbots is widely credited with helping Dubai-based Telegram become one of the world’s biggest messenger apps with 900 million active monthly users. However, the arrest of Russian-born founder Pavel Durov in France last month has increased scrutiny of Telegram’s content moderation and features open to abuse for criminal ends. Durov and Telegram denied wrongdoing and are addressing the criticism. The use of Telegram chatbots to sell stolen data demonstrates the difficulty the app has in preventing nefarious agents taking advantage of its technology and highlights the challenges Indian companies face in keeping their data safe. The Star Health chatbots feature a welcome message stating they are ""by xenZen” and have been operational since at least Aug. 6, said UK-based security researcher Jason Parker. Parker said he posed as a potential buyer on a online hacker forum where a user under the alias xenZen said they made the chatbots and possessed 7.24 terabytes of data related to over 31 million Star Health customers. The data is free via the chatbot on a random, piecemeal basis, but for sale in bulk form. Reuters could neither independently verify xenZen’s claims nor ascertain how the chatbot creator obtained the data. In an email to Reuters, xenZen said they were in discussions with buyers without disclosing who or why they were interested. TAKEN DOWN In testing the bots, Reuters downloaded more than 1,500 files with some documents dated as recently as July 2024. ""If this bot gets taken down watch out and another one will be made available in few hours,” the welcome message read. The chatbots were later marked ”SCAM” with a stock warning that users had reported them as suspect. Reuters shared details of the chatbots with Telegram on Sept. 16 and within 24 hours spokesperson Remi Vaughn said they had been ”taken down” and asked to be informed should more appear. ""The sharing of private information on Telegram is expressly forbidden and is removed whenever it is found. Moderators use a combination of proactive monitoring, AI tools and user reports to remove millions of pieces of harmful content each day.” New chatbots have since appeared offering Star Health data. Star Health said an unidentified person contacted it on Aug. 13 claiming to have access to some of its data. The insurer reported the matter to the cybercrime department of its home state of Tamil Nadu and federal cyber security agency CERT-In. ""The unauthorized acquisition and dissemination of customer data is illegal, and we are actively working with law enforcement to address this criminal activity. Star Health assures its customers and partners that their privacy is of paramount importance to us,” it said in its statement. In an Aug. 14 stock exchange filing, Star Health, India’s biggest player among standalone health insurance providers, said it was investigating an alleged breach of ""a few claims data”. Representatives for CERT-In and the Tamil Nadu cybercrime department did not respond to emailed requests for comment. UNAWARE Telegram allows individuals or organizations to store and share large amounts of data behind anonymous accounts. It also lets them create customizable chatbots which automatically provide content and features based on user requests. Two chatbots distribute Star Health data. One offers claim documents in PDF format. The other allows users to request up to 20 samples from 31.2 million datasets with a single click giving details including policy number, name and even body mass index. Among documents disclosed to Reuters were records related to the treatment of the one-year-old daughter of policyholder Sandeep TS at a hospital in the southern state of Kerala. The records included diagnosis, blood test results, medical history and a bill of nearly 15,000 rupees ($179). ""It sounds concerning. Do you know how this can affect me?” said Sandeep, confirming the documents’ authenticity. He said Star Health had not notified him of any data leak. The chatbot also leaked a claim last year by policyholder Pankaj Subhash Malhotra which included ultrasound imaging test results, details of illness and copies of federal tax account and national ID cards. He also confirmed the documents were genuine and said he was not made aware of any security breach. The Star Health chatbots are part of a broader trend of hackers using such methods to sell stolen data. Of five million people whose data was sold via chatbots, India represented the largest number of victims at 12%, showed the latest survey on the epidemic conducted by NordVPN at the end of 2022. ”The fact that sensitive data is available via Telegram is natural, because Telegram is an easy-to-use storefront,” said NordVPN cybersecurity expert Adrianus Warmenhoven. ”Telegram has become an easier to use method for criminals to interact.”

No material change in market outlook post Fed rate cut; all eyes on RBI now: MC Poll,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/no-material-change-in-market-outlook-post-fed-rate-cut-all-eyes-on-rbi-now-mc-poll-12826053.html,general," September 20, 2024 / 10:28   ","Market experts are of the view that while the 50 basis points rate cut by the US Federal Reserve can be looked as a positive for equity markets globally, including India, it does not significantly change the outlook immediately since it was largely on expected lines. More importantly though, they believe that all eyes are now on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and a rate cut by the central bank would send a strong signal while providing a booster shot in terms of improving investor sentiments and flows -- both domestic and foreign institutional – as well. Moneycontrol reached out to more than a dozen market experts across categories including, research analysts and fund managers. The unanimous view was that the US Fed rate cut was on expected lines – hence the subdued reaction on Thursday – and the focus will now shift to RBI as the Monetary Policy Committee is scheduled to meet next month. Incidentally, a MC Poll of 18 economists on Thursday showed that just three predicted the possibility of a 25 basis points rate cut by RBI in October. “The focus is more on the RBI's reaction, which is expected to be delayed and not immediate. The market will be watching for RBI’s announcements and outlook rather than the Fed's actions,” said Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities. “There is a likelihood of a change in stance from the RBI, and a rate cut may happen in the next meeting. Overall, there is no significant change expected, and the market is waiting to see what the RBI will do next to assess the potential impact,” added Jasani. In a similar context, Emkay Global said that it expects the RBI to follow the US Fed and cut rates either in October or December. “Our view is that the impact of the rate cuts on the broader markets… is likely to be limited. Select sectors may do well, but only if there is a second-order impact on earnings,” it said. This assumes significance as while the US Fed decision was keenly awaited the ‘buy on rumour, sell on news’ approach of the broader market ensured that there was no exuberance visible in the Indian markets on Thursday. The benchmark Sensex gained a mere 236 points on Thursday to close at an all-time high of 83,184.80 while the broader Nifty ended the day at 25,415.80, up 38.25 points. “In terms of market reaction, the immediate response may appear as a ‘knee-jerk’ reaction, common with the 'buy the rumour, sell the news' dynamic. However, on a broader scale, this is a favourable development for emerging markets, including India. Key sectors like financials, pharma, and IT, which are closely tied to global trends, are well-positioned to benefit from renewed demand,” said Krishna Appala, Senior Research Analyst, Capitalmind Research. Similarly, Deepak Ramaraju, Senior Fund Manager, Shriram AMC, is of the view that the markets are expected to remain range-bound but with a positive bias as central banks of broader emerging economies are likely to undertake rate cut decisions. “On the domestic front, RBI will focus on the data and might likely undertake a rate cut in December… The FII flows can be outbound in the short term and as the US dollar starts easing, the flows can come back into India,’ said Ramaraju. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have been buying aggressively buying shares in the Indian stock market in the recent past with the September net buying pegged at nearly $4 billion – a huge jump from previous month’s $873 million. “In terms of FII inflows, while there's a lot of talk about how this could benefit India, it's not guaranteed. Yes, the Fed rate cut is positive for capital flows, but there are other factors to consider -- US elections, earnings, oil prices, and more,” said Trideep Bhattacharya, CIO, Edelweiss Asset Management. “In terms of capital flows, falling interest rates generally boost capital inflows into emerging markets. The second-order impact is that sectors benefiting from rate cuts, as we transition from rising to falling rates, will likely see positive effects. For Indian markets, sectors such as non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), real estate, and IT services are expected to benefit from this environment,” he added. “The (US Fed) rate cut was largely in line with expectations… Our outlook on the equity side remains bullish… As for the RBI, we are watching to see if they will follow suit. The RBI has expressed its intent to follow domestic cues, but given the state of domestic macroeconomics, including persistent inflation concerns, the RBI may not act in perfect alignment with recent events,” said Nirav Karkera, Head of Research at Fisdom. “There could first be a change in stance, with a potential rate cut happening in the next monetary policy announcement. However, we do not expect the RBI to make an immediate move or match the recent rate cut in size,"" added Karkera. On a different note, a section of market experts are also advising investors to remain cautious as valuations currently seem to be in the higher range and not exactly in sync with earnings and fundamentals. “We have been maintaining our view for last couple of months that Fed would be cutting rates soon and that has now come upon. However, the intensity of rate cuts seems steep and could be more political agenda driven for the US. We maintain our cautious optimism view on Indian markets and are focusing on bottom-up stock ideas where valuations and earnings are in sync,” said Aniruddha Sarkar - Chief Investment Officer & Portfolio Manager - Quest Investment Advisors.

""With the direction of IDF intelligence, the IAF struck approximately 30 Hezbollah launchers and terrorist infrastructure sites, containing about 150 launcher barrels ready to fire projectiles toward Israeli territory,"" the IDF stated.

These directives were issued to residents in areas such as Merom Galil, Upper Galilee, Mevo'ot Hermon, Yesod HaMa'ala, Hazor, Rosh Pina, Safed, Metula, and northern Golan communities following an updated assessment of the situation. The airstrikes came shortly after Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, warned that ""retribution will come"" to Israel in response to recent attacks on Hezbollah's communication devices, which led to several casualties and thousands of injuries. Nasrallah claimed that Israel had crossed a ""red line"" following bombings that remotely detonated hundreds of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria. Israeli Defense Minister Gallant said that Hezbollah ""will pay an increasing price,"" asserting that Israel's goal is to create safe conditions along its border with Lebanon, allowing residents to return home. ""Our aim is to ensure the safe return of Israel's northern communities. Over time, Hezbollah will face greater consequences. Our military actions will continue,"" Gallant stated. In light of the recent attacks targeting Hezbollah members' communication devices, theÂ US State Department has urged American citizens in Lebanon to maintain a low profile and review their security protocols.

Dozens killed in Mali attack by Al Qaeda affiliate,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/dozens-killed-in-mali-attack-by-al-qaeda-affiliate-12826133.html,World," September 20, 2024 / 11:42   ","An elaborate attack by an Al Qaeda affiliate in Maliâ€™s capital this week killed some 70 people, diplomatic and security sources said on Thursday, while the government offered no figures on casualties. Militants attacked an elite police training academy and the airport on Tuesday, demonstrating their ability to strike at the heart of Maliâ€™s capital. The country is fighting an insurgency that took root over a decade ago in its arid north. The scale and complexity of the attacks further undermines the ruling juntaâ€™s claims that security has improved since it booted out French and U.S. forces, and turned to Russia instead for security. Two diplomats serving in the region, including one based in Bamako, said the death toll was believed to be in the 70s. Reuters could not independently verify the numbers. A third diplomat based in the region said hundreds were believed dead and wounded, and hospitals had run out of beds to treat survivors. Since the conflict in Mali erupted, violence has spread to neighbours in the Sahel region and reached the north of coastal countries. Thousands have been killed and millions displaced in the region, and some fighters are allied with Al Qaeda or Islamic State. Tuesdayâ€™s attack was claimed by Al Qaeda affiliate Jamaâ€™a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM). Maliâ€™s ruling junta has said it suffered some losses, without providing details. A Malian newspaper reported that funerals for some 50 police cadets were to be held on Thursday. Reuters was unable to obtain further details or confirm the services took place. The attack was captured in videos published on social media that showed insurgents setting fire to the presidential jet and dead bodies at the police academy. Only days prior, Maliâ€™s junta leader Assimi Goita, who seized power in a coup in 2021, said his army had considerably weakened the armed groups it is fighting with Russiaâ€™s help. The attack also comes on the heels of a battle with high casualties in July, when insurgents wiped out scores of experienced Russian mercenaries and Malian forces in fighting near Maliâ€™s northern border with Algeria.

Brazil drought punishes coffee farms and threatens to push prices even higher,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/brazil-drought-punishes-coffee-farms-and-threatens-to-push-prices-even-higher-12826076.html,World," September 20, 2024 / 10:59   ","Silvio Almeida’s coffee plantation sits at an ideal altitude on a Brazilian hillside, whose clay-rich soil does well at retaining moisture from rainfall and a nearby reservoir. Lately, though, water is scarce on Almeida’s modest farm in Caconde, a town in one of Sao Paulo state’s key growing regions. He can’t get his coffee to grow the way it should. In Brazil, the world’s largest coffee producer, Almeida and other farmers have started grappling with the nation’s worst drought in more than seven decades and above-average temperatures. Almeida expected to harvest 120 sacks of coffee beans this harvest season, but instead managed just 100. “Given the conditions here, the 2025 crop is already affected,” he told The Associated Press, pointing to a part of his plantation where flower buds died before blooming. ”I won’t say it’s doomed, because with God anything is possible. But based on the situation, it’s already compromised.” Brazil’s harvest season that ends this month was virtually flat from last year, and exports surged, but the ongoing drought is already complicating the start of the 2025/2026 season, according to a report Monday by the Center for Advanced Studies on Applied Economics at the University of Sao Paulo’s agribusiness school. At the same time, Vietnam, the world’s second-biggest coffee producer, is experiencing heat and drought, affecting its crops. Potential supply shortages in both countries have started driving up global coffee prices, according to the report. The market is closely monitoring how Brazilian coffee plants endure these adverse climate conditions, which can cause flowers to stop blooming, fail to turn into cherries or produce lower-quality beans, said Felippe Serigati, who coordinates the master’s program in agribusiness at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a university in Sao Paulo. “It could result in a smaller coffee harvest,” Serigati said. ”Since the market tends to anticipate these movements, we’ve already seen the price of arabica coffee in New York and robusta (coffee) in Europe trading at higher levels.” Coffee prices haven’t reached the record highs the world saw in the late 1970s, after a severe frost wiped out 70% of Brazil’s coffee plants. But they have been soaring in recent years. In August, the International Coffee Organization’s Composite Indicator Price – which combines the price of several types of green coffee beans – averaged $2.38 per pound, up nearly 55% from the same month a year ago. In part, prices are rising because of higher demand, particularly in Asia. But weather is also driving increases. Drought, frost and fire have damaged as much as one-fifth of arabica coffee producers’ growing areas in Brazil, said Billy Roberts, a senior economist for food and beverage at Colorado-based CoBank. “It’s not looking like it will get that much better in the near term. They will need consistent rainfall to recover,” he said. Uncontrolled, manmade wildfires across Brazil have lately been ravaging protected areas and farms. One of them ripped through Caconde last week. Almeida, who is also a math teacher at a local public school, helped calculate the damage for a regional association. So far, he estimates the blazes affected 519 hectares (1,282 acres). Half was native Atlantic Forest, 30% pasture and 15% coffee plantations. On Almeida’s own land, 2,000 of his 15,000 plants were torched. His neighbor, João Rodrigues Martins, lost everything. Martins, 71, had 2,500 coffee plants on a small plot, now completely blackened by soot. The coffee he sells to a local cooperative is his livelihood and also pays for his son’s medical treatment. For smallholders, seeing years of cultivation reduced to ash is tough to reckon with. Last week, Martins ran through fire to save his bee boxes. Today, he is finding the strength to continue forward. “Faith is a boat that helps us navigate life,” he said.

Donald Trump says Jews will be partly to blame if he loses election,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/donald-trump-says-jews-will-be-partly-to-blame-if-he-loses-election-12826065.html,World," September 20, 2024 / 10:39   ","Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Thursday that Jewish-American voters would be partly to blame if he loses the Nov. 5 election to Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate. During comments to the Israeli-American Council National Summit in Washington, the former president lamented that he was trailing Harris among American Jews. Israel would likely cease to exist within two years should Harris win the election, and Jews would be partly to blame for that outcome because they tend to vote for Democrats, Trump argued. ”If I don’t win this election – and the Jewish people would really have a lot to do with that if that happens because if 40%, I mean, 60% of the people are voting for the enemy – Israel, in my opinion, will cease to exist within two years,” Trump told the crowd. Trump was citing a poll that he said showed Harris polling at 60% among American Jews. He also lamented winning less than 30% of the vote among American Jews in the 2016 election, which he won, and the 2020 election, which he lost to Democratic President Joe Biden. It was not clear what poll the former president was citing, but a recent Pew Research Survey found American Jews favor Harris over Trump, 65% to 34%. Trump made similar comments at a separate summit earlier in the evening, also in Washington, which was dedicated to fighting antisemitism in America. The Trump campaign has made winning over Jewish voters in key battleground states a priority. U.S. Jews have leaned heavily towards Democrats in federal elections for decades and continue to do so, but just a small shift in the Jewish vote could determine the winner in November. In the crucial battleground of Pennsylvania, for example, there are over 400,000 Jewish people, in a state Biden won by 81,000 votes in 2020. In a statement before the speech, Morgan Finkelstein, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, criticized Trump for at times associating with anti-Semites. Trump has rejected all accusations of anti-Semitism, noting during his speeches on Thursday that he has a Jewish son-in-law. During his comments, Trump did not address a CNN report published earlier in the day regarding the Republican gubernatorial candidate in North Carolina, Mark Robinson. That report alleged Robinson once called himself a ”black NAZI!” in comments posted on a pornography website and that he advocated for the return of slavery.

"PM Modi, Joe Biden to sign 2 key pacts; no word on meeting with Donald Trump",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/pm-modi-joe-biden-to-sign-2-key-pacts-no-word-on-meeting-with-donald-trump-12826024.html,World," September 20, 2024 / 10:16   ","Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden will hold a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the Quad Leaders' Summit in Delaware on September 2 during which the two leaders are expected to sign at least two agreements, foreign secretary Vikram Misri has said. Misri briefed the media on September 19 on Modi-'s September 21-23 visit to the United States. One of the agreement would be on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), while the other will be a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on the India-US drug framework, he said. During the meeting, Modi is expected to update Biden on his recent discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv to find a peaceful resolution to the war between the two neighbours, which is in its third year now. Modi is also expected to hold bilateral meetings with Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. “This will also serve as a kind of farewell event for President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida in the context of the Quad,” Misri said. While Biden has opted out of the November presidential election, Kishida will step down later this month. When asked if Modi would meet former Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Misri was non-committal and said, “We are scheduling many meetings for the Prime Minister, and we will update you as plans are finalised.” The former US president recently said he would meet Modi during his visit. Quad Summit The Quad summit would be busy, with a leaders’ declaration expected at the end of the event. Promoting peace, prosperity, and stability in the Indo-Pacific region remain Quad's priorities, Misri said. Health security, climate change, emerging technologies, connectivity, maritime security, and counter-terrorism efforts will also feature during the talks. The highlight would be the launch of the ""Cancer Moonshot"" initiative, which aims to prevent, detect, treat, and alleviate the impact of cancer on patients and their families. The member countries will initially collaborate on reducing the burden of cervical cancer in the Indo-Pacific region, Misri said. Though India was to host the Quad summit this year, the event was moved to the US on Washington’s request. India will host the four-nation summit next year. Modi will also speak at an Indian community event in New York on September 22 and address the United Nations General Assembly on September 23. (With inputs from PTI)

Israeli airstrikes intensify conflict with Hezbollah: Here are 15 things to know,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/israeli-airstrikes-intensify-conflict-with-hezbollah-here-are-15-things-to-know-12825992.html,World," September 20, 2024 / 09:55   ","The Israeli military continued its operations against Hezbollah on Thursday, announcing that it had struck approximately 100 rocket launchers in southern Lebanon. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported that along with the launchers it targeted additional Hezbollah infrastructure, including about 1,000 barrels that were ready to be used for imminent rocket attacks on Israeli territory. Each launcher is equipped with multiple barrels capable of firing unguided rockets. According to Lebanon's state-run National News Agency, Israel conducted at least 52 airstrikes in southern Lebanon between 9pm and 10pm local time. Earlier on September 19, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group claimed responsibility for at least 17 attacks on Israeli military sites in northern Israel. In response to the escalating violence, the IDF has issued safety instructions for several communities in northern Israel, advising civilians to minimize movement, avoid gatherings, and remain close to shelters. Top 15 things to know about the intensifying Israel-Hezbollah conflict Israeli Airstrikes on Lebanon: Israel carried out a series of airstrikes on southern Lebanon, one of the most intense since the October 7 hostilities began with Hezbollah.

Nike’s sales have weakened recently and its stock is down about 24% year-to-date. In its most recent quarter, which ended on May 31, the company reported a 2% revenue decline. Donahoe said at the time that the company is approaching its “near-term challenges head-on, while making continued progress in the areas that matter most to Nike’s future.” In February, the company based in Beaverton, Oregon, announced it was cutting 2% of its global workforce, or little over 1,600 jobs, aiming to cut costs and reinvest the savings into what it sees as big growth areas like sport, health and wellness. Nike’s stock jumped almost 8% following the announcement, which came after the close of regular-session trading on Wall Street.

Workers at Tesla have contributed $42,824 to Harris' presidential campaign versus $24,840 to Trump's campaign, according to OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan nonprofit that tracks U.S. campaign contributions and lobbying data. Employees at Musk's rocket company SpaceX have donated $34,526 to Harris versus $7,652 to Trump. Employees at the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, have donated $13,213 to Harris versus less than $500 to Trump. While the figures are relatively small for campaign fundraising, they indicate political leanings at odds with Musk's own. The world's richest man, Musk has boosted Trump on X and dismissed left-leaning ideas as a ""woke-mind virus."" Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He backed President Joe Biden in 2020 but has tacked rightward since then. Trump has said that if he wins the Nov. 5 election, he will appoint Musk to lead a government efficiency commission. The OpenSecrets data includes donations from company employees and owners and those individuals' immediate family members. Campaign finance laws prohibit companies themselves from donating to federal campaigns. Many of Musk's employees are based in California, a Democratic stronghold, said Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, which is a Tesla shareholder. Gerber is also an investor in X. In July, Musk said he would move X and SpaceX headquarters to Texas from California because of a California gender-identity law he called the ""last straw."" Gerber said such a move would mean ""losing out on a lot of potential talent"" in California.

"Hezbollah claims ""Red Line"" breached after deadly attack; Israel threatened with ""crushing response"" by Iran",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/hezbollah-leader-says-attack-on-devices-crossed-red-line-vows-to-retaliate-against-israel-12825851.html,World," September 19, 2024 / 21:56   ","Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah has condemned Israel's recent attack on the group's communications devices as a severe blow and a breach of red lines. In a televised address, Nasrallah vowed continued strikes on northern Israel, asserting that Israelis would remain unable to return to their homes until the Gaza conflict ends. The remarks follow a series of unprecedented bombings that occurred this week, widely attributed to Israel. The attacks targeted pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah, resulting in at least 37 deaths and around 3,000 injuries across Beirut, parts of Lebanon, and Damascus. The explosions are seen as part of Israel’s strategic effort to incapacitate Hezbollah members and disrupt their operations. In response to the bombings, Israeli forces have intensified their strikes, with at least two Israeli soldiers confirmed dead in the skirmishes. Israeli warplanes have also carried out low-flying maneuvers over Beirut, adding to the city’s tensions. The ongoing exchanges have raised concerns about a potential escalation into full-scale war. Iran, a key ally of Hezbollah, has also reacted strongly. The Revolutionary Guards Commander Hossein Salami issued a statement threatening Israel with a “crushing response” from the “axis of resistance,” which includes Hezbollah and other Iran-aligned groups. Salami labeled the bombings as acts of desperation and failure by Israel and promised a retaliatory strike. The latest developments come amid a conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which began with a militant attack on October 7, 2023. The violence has seen significant casualties and displacement on both sides of the border. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has indicated a shift in focus to the northern front, suggesting a potential new phase in the conflict. Meanwhile, Lebanon continues to grapple with the aftermath of the bombings, with heightened security measures and ongoing investigations into the attacks. (With Agencies inputs)

Israeli military says it is striking Hezbollah targets in Lebanon,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/israeli-military-says-it-is-striking-hezbollah-targets-in-lebanon-12825835.html,World," September 19, 2024 / 20:50   ","The Israeli military said it was striking Hezbollah targets in Lebanon on Thursday, shortly before the movement's leader was due to give a speech. It also said the military chief of staff had approved plans for Israel's north, which borders Lebanon. The military said Hezbollah had turned southern Lebanon into a combat zone. ""For decades, Hezbollah has weaponized civilian homes, dug tunnels beneath them, and used civilians as human shields,"" it said. ""The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) is operating to bring security to northern Israel in order to enable the return of residents to their homes, as well as to achieve all of the war goals,"" it said. A separate military statement said that the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, had recently completed approval of plans for theÂ northernÂ arena. The statements were released a few minutes before Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah was due to deliver a speech for the first time since thousands of explosions in booby-trapped radios and pagers hit the Iran-backed Lebanese group. The attacks on Hezbollah's communications equipment killed 37 people and wounded around 3,000, raising fears that a full-blown war was imminent. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind the attacks but multiple security sources have said they were carried out by its spy agency Mossad.

Inside Mossad: How Israel’s covert operations target enemies,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/inside-mossad-how-israels-covert-operations-target-enemies-12825786.html,World," September 19, 2024 / 19:37   ","In a devastating turn of events, Lebanon was rocked by a series of deadly explosions over two days, leaving a trail of destruction and heartache. The attacks, believed to be orchestrated by Israel, targeted Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group that has been responsible for rocket attacks on northern Israel. The explosions, which occurred in homes, offices, and even during funerals, were triggered by pagers and two-way radios used by Hezbollah militants. The scale of the devastation, coupled with the precision of the attacks, pointed to a meticulously planned operation by Israeli intelligence. At least 30 people were killed, and thousands were injured in these explosions. The attacks have left Hezbollah reeling, stunned by the devastating blow dealt by Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad. According to a New York Times report, an operation targeting Hezbollah involved pagers, once seen as secure, being turned into weapons. The chaos began at 3:25pm on Tuesday when two Hezbollah members' pagers exploded at a mall, followed by another blast at a Hezbollah office. Within minutes, hundreds of pagers across Lebanon and Syria detonated nearly simultaneously. Eyewitnesses described scenes of utter chaos: “men flying off motorcycles, shoppers collapsing in agony, smoke snaking from pockets.” The report quoted Mohammed Awada, 52, “My son went crazy and started to scream when he saw the man's hand flying away from him.” The attacks disrupted public spaces and penetrated Hezbollah’s infrastructure, including explosions at a funeral for earlier victims. Sophisticated Israeli Operation According to the New York Times, Israel executed a sophisticated operation using a front company, BAC Consulting, purportedly a Hungary-based firm contracted by Taiwan’s Gold Apollo to produce pagers. In reality, it was an Israeli intelligence ploy. The pagers, which Hezbollah thought would protect them from surveillance, contained batteries laced with the explosive PETN. The deception was so meticulous that even the company’s website and LinkedIn profiles were convincingly crafted. The operation didn't stop there. The next day, walkie-talkies and other electronic devices used by Hezbollah exploded, showing a multi-layered strategy. Though Israeli officials have not confirmed their involvement, it's widely believed that Mossad orchestrated the attacks. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant announced a “new phase” in the conflict, stating, “The center of gravity is shifting to the north by diverting resources and forces.” An Israeli general added, “We have many capabilities that we haven’t yet activated,” signalling a stern warning to Hezbollah. Some Operations conducted by Mossad Operation Wrath of God (1972-1979): Israel targeted individuals responsible for Munich Olympics attack Capture of Adolf Eichmann (1960): Nazi war criminal abducted from Argentina Operation Entebbe (1976): Hostage rescue operation in Uganda Stuxnet Cyber Attack (2008): Iran's nuclear programme disrupted Theft of Iran's nuclear Secrets (2018): Mossad stole documents from Tehran Assassination of Imad Mugniyeh (2008): Killed Hezbollah commanderMossad’s Precision and Strategic Intent The recent attacks on Hezbollah are not an isolated incident. Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, has a long history of conducting covert operations, including assassinations and sabotage missions. The agency has gained a reputation for its surgical precision in targeting high-profile individuals, such as Iranian nuclear scientists and Hezbollah leaders. According to a Foreign Policy report, Mossad’s pager attack on Hezbollah was driven by the need to restore its “omnipotent and omnipresent” image, especially after the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July. The attack signals that Israel might be preparing for war with Hezbollah. Since October 7th, 2023, Hezbollah's rocket fire into Israel has intensified, escalating tensions at the northern border. According to the report, the pager explosions were likely meant to disrupt Hezbollah’s infrastructure and send a message that Israel could strike at any time. A retired Israeli military official remarked, “Why didn’t we do it for 11 months? Because we were not willing to go to war yet. What’s happening now? Israel is ready for war.” The attack has delayed Hezbollah’s operations, forcing the group to repair its communication network and investigate potential infiltrators. Despite this tactical victory, Israel still faces the challenge of containing threats from Hezbollah, Hamas, and Iran without triggering a wider regional conflict. For Hezbollah, the incident highlights its vulnerability to Israeli intelligence. Regional Tensions The aftermath of the pager attacks has left Hezbollah in a state of paranoia, as thousands of its operatives’ secret affiliations were exposed to family and neighbours, eroding trust within the group and its civilian base. This incident could heighten tensions in Lebanon, raising concerns about the vulnerability of imported electronics. Iranian-aligned militias are now worried that more devices—phones, tablets, radios—could be similarly compromised. As Lebanon deals with this tragedy, the region risks a broader conflict. The attacks might signal a larger campaign against Hezbollah or be a strategic move in the ongoing geopolitical struggle. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remark about returning northern residents safely hints at potential further action. The line between peacetime and war, and between civilian technology and weapons, is increasingly blurred. As one Lebanese woman warned, “Turn off your phones now!”—highlighting the new reality where even everyday devices can become instruments of war. (Inputs from agencies)

Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Oikya Parishad's leader Nirmal Rozario called for an independent and impartial investigation of communal violence under the supervision of the United Nations, the Daily Star newspaper reported. A total of 2,010 incidents of communal violence took place in 68 out of 76 districts and metropolitan areas across the country between August 4 and 20, resulting in the deaths of nine people, Nirmal Rozario, one of the vice-presidents of the organisation, was quoted as saying by the paper. Giving details of the communal violence during the political turmoil that ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Nirmal said that 1,705 families were directly affected by the violence. Among them, 157 families had their homes attacked, looted, vandalised, and set on fire. Some of their businesses were also looted, vandalised, and torched, he said at a press conference at Dhaka Reporters Unity. Nirmal said that these families are now living in dire conditions. He said that Khulna division saw the most violence, where four women were raped. Out of the 1,705 affected families, 34 belonged to indigenous communities and the lands of some of the families were occupied, he said. Additionally, 69 places of worship were attacked, vandalised, looted, and set ablaze during the communal violence, the newspaper reported. Nirmal called for an independent and impartial investigation of communal violence under the supervision of the United Nations. He also demanded the withdrawal of false cases against the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Oikya Parishad's general secretary Rana Dasgupta and other leaders, end of ongoing communal violence, and the arrest and punishment of the perpetrators. He also announced a nationwide protest and rally on Saturday across the country, including Dhaka, to press their demands. Bangladesh's interim government on Tuesday granted magisterial powers to the Army for two months to improve law and order in the violence-hit country and prevent ""subversive acts"". Home Adviser Lt Gen (retd.) Md. Jahangir Alam Chowdhury said on Wednesday that the ""people of Bangla (Bangladesh) will reap the benefit of bestowing the magistracy power upon the commissioned officers of Bangladesh Army."" ""We are witnessing subversive acts and disrupted stability in several places, especially in the industrial areas across the country. Given the situation, Army personnel have been given magistracy power,"" Law Adviser Asif Nazrul said. He added that he believed the army personnel would not misuse this authority. Many police personnel in Bangladesh have been absent on the streets since the fall of the Sheikh Hasina-led government. Bangladesh witnessed incidents of violence against members of Hindu, Buddhist and Christian communities following the fall of the Hasina-led Awami League government last month. Hasina resigned and fled to India on August 5 following unprecedented anti-government student-led protests over a controversial quota system in government jobs. Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, 84, who is leading the interim government as its Chief Advisor, last month met the Hindu community leaders and vowed to promote interfaith harmony.

Russia has since this summer regularly announced the capture of new villages in eastern Ukraine. The defence ministry said its forces had ""liberated the village of Georgievka,"" around 30 kilometres (20 miles) west of Donetsk city, the regional capital under Russian control. The village lies between Marinka, which fell to Russian forces at the end of last year and Ukrainian-controlled Kurakhove, in an area of the front that has not moved much in weeks. It also lies south of the town of Krasnogorivka, which Moscow said it captured last week. Further north in the Donetsk region, Russia has been pressing to capture the town of Pokrovsk, advancing fast in the area since the summer. The Russian advance in the east comes as Kyiv has for more than a month controlled swathes of Russia's Kursk region. Ukraine said Thursday that Russian shelling killed two civilians in the Sumy region, which borders the Kursk region.

The Taiwanese government's Mainland Affairs Council said the ban, which takes effect next week, ignores rules laid out by the World Trade Organization, of which both sides are members. The move comes amid growing military, political and economic pressure on Taiwan's government to concede to Beijing's control. Taiwan's semi-tropical climate and fertile soil have nurtured an agricultural industry valued at around $500 billion dollars, alongside high-tech corporations that produce the world's most cutting-edge computer chips. China's move “harms the interests of farmers” on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and does nothing to improve relations between the two, the council said. China and Taiwan should seek dialogue through the WTO to resolve their differences, it added. The WTO is one of the few forums through which discussion is possible between the two sides, which divided amid civil war in 1949. Chinese diplomatic pressure has barred Taiwan from the United Nations and reduced its number of official diplomatic allies to 12. The Chinese ban appears to target rural Taiwanese, who for the past two decades have largely voted for pro-independence candidates but whose local officials have been courted by China with all-expense vacations and other enticements. China has used trade pressure on countries such as Australia, South Korea and Norway over perceived political slights, using its market for resources and consumer goods as leverage, with mixed results.

What to know about the two waves of deadly explosions that hit Lebanon and Syria,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/what-to-know-about-the-two-waves-of-deadly-explosions-that-hit-lebanon-and-syria-12825549.html,World," September 19, 2024 / 15:59   ","Just one day after pagers used by hundreds of members of the militant group Hezbollah exploded, more electronic devices detonated in Lebanon Wednesday in what appeared to be a second wave of sophisticated, deadly attacks that targeted an extraordinary number of people. Both attacks, which are widely believed to be carried out by Israel, have hiked fears that the two sides’ simmering conflict could escalate into all-out war. This week's explosions have also deepened concerns about the scope of potentially compromised devices, particularly after such bombings have killed or injured so many civilians. Here's what we know so far. On Tuesday, pagers used by hundreds of Hezbollah members exploded almost simultaneously in parts of Lebanon as well as Syria. The attack killed at least 12 people — including two young children — and wounded thousands more. An American official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Israel briefed the U.S. on the operation — where small amounts of explosives hidden in the pagers were detonated. The Lebanese government and Iran-backed Hezbollah also blamed Israel for the deadly explosions. The Israeli military, which has a long history of sophisticated operations behind enemy lines, declined to comment. A day after these deadly explosions, more detonations triggered in Beirut and parts of Lebanon Wednesday — including several blasts heard at a funeral in Beirut for three Hezbollah members and a child killed by Tuesday's explosions, according to Associated Press journalists at the scene. At least 20 people were killed and another 450 were wounded, the Health Ministry said, in this apparent second attack. When speaking to troops on Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant made no mention of the explosions of electronic devices, but praised the work of Israel's army and security agencies and said “we are at the start of a new phase in the war."" A Hezbollah official told the AP that walkie-talkies used by the group exploded on Wednesday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. Lebanon’s official news agency also reported that solar energy systems exploded in homes in several areas of Beirut and in southern Lebanon, wounding at least one girl. While details are still emerging from Wednesday's attack, the second wave of explosions targeted a country that is still reeling from Tuesday's pager bombings. That attack appeared to be a complex Israeli operation targeting Hezbollah, but an enormous amount of civilian casualties were also reported, as the detonations occurred wherever members' pagers happened to be — including homes, cars, grocery stores and cafes. Hezbollah has used pagers as a way to communicate for years. And more recently, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah warned the group’s members not to carry cellphones, saying they could be used by Israel to track the group’s movements. Pagers also run on a different wireless network than mobile phones, which usually makes them more resilient in times of emergency. And for a group like Hezbollah, the pagers provided a means to sidestep what’s believed to be intensive Israeli electronic surveillance on mobile phone networks in Lebanon — as pagers' tech is simpler and carries lower risks for intercepted communications. Elijah J. Magnier, a Brussels-based veteran and a senior political risk analyst who says he has had conversations with members of Hezbollah and survivors of the attack, said that the newer brand of pagers used in Tuesday’s explosions were procured more than six months ago. How they arrived in Lebanon remains unclear. Taiwanese company Gold Apollo said Wednesday it had authorized use of its brand on the AR-924 pager model — but that a Budapest, Hungary-based company called BAC Consulting KFT produced and sold the pagers. Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs said that it had no records of direct exports of Gold Apollo pagers to Lebanon. And Hungarian government spokesman later added that the pager devices had never been in Hungary, either, noting that BAC had merely acted as an intermediary. Speculation around the origins of the devices that exploded Wednesday has also emerged. A sales executive at the U.S. subsidiary of Japanese walkie-talkie maker Icom told The Associated Press that the exploded radio devices in Lebanon appear to be a knock-off product and not made by Icom. “I can guarantee you they were not our products,” said Ray Novak, a senior sales manager for Icom’s amateur radio division, in an interview Wednesday at a trade show in Providence, Rhode Island. Novak said Icom introduced the V-82 model more than two decades ago and it has long since been discontinued. It was designed for amateur radio operators and for use in social or emergency communications, including by people tracking tornadoes or hurricanes, he said. Tuesday's explosions were most likely the result of supply-chain interference, several experts told The Associated Press — noting that very small explosive devices may have been built into the pagers prior to their delivery to Hezbollah, and then all remotely triggered simultaneously, possibly with a radio signal. That corroborates information shared from the U.S. official. A former British Army bomb disposal officer explained that an explosive device has five main components: A container, a battery, a triggering device, a detonator and an explosive charge. “A pager has three of those already,” said the ex-officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he now works as a consultant with clients on the Middle East. “You would only need to add the detonator and the charge.” This signals involvement of a state actor, said Sean Moorhouse, a former British Army officer and explosive ordinance disposal expert. He added that Israel’s foreign intelligence agency, the Mossad, was the most obvious suspect to have the resources to carry out such an attack. Israel has a long history of carrying out similar operations in the past. The specifics of Wednesday's explosions are still uncertain. But reports of more electronic devices exploding may suggest even greater infiltration of boobytrap-like interference in Lebanon’s supply chain. It also deepens concerns around the lack of certainty of who may be holding rigged devices. It would take a long time to plan an attack of this scale. The exact specifics are still unknown, but experts who spoke with the AP about Tuesday's explosions shared estimates ranging anywhere between several months to two years. The sophistication of the attack suggests that the culprit has been collecting intelligence for a long time, explained Nicholas Reese, adjunct instructor at the Center for Global Affairs in New York University’s School of Professional Studies. An attack of this caliber requires building the relationships needed to gain physical access to the pagers before they were sold; developing the technology that would be embedded in the devices; and developing sources who can confirm that the targets were carrying the pagers. Citing conversations with Hezbollah contacts, Magnier said the group is currently investigating what type of explosives were used in the device, suspecting RDX or PETN, highly explosive materials that can cause significant damage with as little as 3-5 grams. They are also questioning whether the device had a GPS system allowing Israel to track movement of the group members. N.R. Jenzen-Jones, an expert in military arms who is director of the Australian-based Armament Research Services, added that “such a large-scale operation also raises questions of targeting"" — stressing the number of causalities and enormous impact reported so far. “How can the party initiating the explosive be sure that a target’s child, for example, is not playing with the pager at the time it functions?” he said.

Apple gets EU warning to open up iPhone operating system,https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/apple-gets-eu-warning-to-open-up-iphone-operating-system-article-12825537.html,World," September 19, 2024 / 15:37   ","Apple Inc. has been warned by the European Union to open up its highly guarded iPhone and iPad operating systems to rival technologies, or eventually risk significant fines under its flagship digital antitrust rules. EU watchdogs announced under the bloc’s Digital Markets Act that the Cupertino, California-based firm must step into line with strict new laws on making operating systems fully functional with other technologies. The Brussels-based authority gave the company six months to comply, or face the threat of future penalties. While the announcement is a step shy of being a formal investigation, the EU aims to compel Apple to re-engineer its services to allow rival companies to access the iPhone’s and iPad operating systems. “Today is the first time we use specification proceedings under the DMA to guide Apple towards effective compliance with its interoperability obligations,” EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. “Effective interoperability, for example with smartphones and their operating systems, plays an important role in this.” Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The EU announcement confirms an earlier report by Bloomberg. One of the aims of the DMA is to ensure that other developers can gain access to key Apple features, such as its Siri voice commands and its payments chip. The EU may later decide to launch a formal probe if Apple doesn’t step into line with the DMA, which could eventually lead to hefty fines of up to 10% of global annual sales. It is already facing a parallel investigation into its App Store rules for developers, which could also lead to hefty penalties. Earlier this month, Apple announced the latest version of its flagship device, the iPhone 16, betting it can entice consumers with modest hardware upgrades and AI technology that’s still on the horizon. But in June, the US giant said that certain features — including Apple Intelligence, iPhone Mirroring and SharePlay Screen Sharing — would be held back from the EU, due to the DMA’s requirements on operating systems to work with third-party apps.

Israel arrests citizen allegedly recruited by Iran to kill Netanyahu,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/israel-arrests-citizen-allegedly-recruited-by-iran-to-kill-netanyahu-12825530.html,World," September 19, 2024 / 16:39   ","Israel's police arrested an Israeli citizen allegedly recruited by Iranian intelligence to plot the assassinations of top Israeli officials including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a joint statement by the police and Shin Bet said Thursday. ""An Israeli citizen was recruited by Iranian intelligence to promote assassinations of Israeli figures. He was smuggled twice into Iran and received payment for carrying out missions,"" the statement said. It said that Netanyahu, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar as well as other top officials were among the targets. The Israeli citizen, ""a businessman who lived in Turkey for an extended period,"" maintained connections with Turkish and Iranian individuals who introduced him by phone to an Iranian businessman called Eddie, the police said. They said the Israeli -- reported by local media to be a Jewish person from the city of Ashkelon -- first visited Iran in May 2024 to meet Eddie, after he had ""difficulty leaving"" Iran. He also met someone called Hajjah, who was introduced as an Iranian security operative. The police said he was asked during this trip to carry out security missions in Israel, including transferring ""money or a gun"", taking pictures of crowded public places and threatening other Israelis recruited by Tehran. In August, the investigation found, the arrested man was smuggled to Iran in a lorry. While there ""he met with additional Iranian intelligence agents and was asked by them to carry out terrorist activities for Iran on Israeli soil, including promoting assassination attacks"". Some of the proposed assassinations were characterised as being revenge for the killing of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July. Iran and Hamas have accused Israel of being behind Haniyeh's death. Israel has not commented on the killing. The suspect was also asked to perform additional tasks, including recruiting members of Israel's Mossad spy agency to be double agents, police said. After asking for a $1 million advance, the Israeli individual was given 5,000 euros for taking part in the meetings and told he would be contacted in the future. ""This is a very serious case that exemplifies the enormous efforts of Iranian intelligence agents to recruit Israeli citizens to promote terrorist activities in Israel"", a senior Shin Bet official was quoted as saying.

"Decline in Asian American enrollment at Princeton, Yale, and Duke sparks legal scrutiny: Report",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/decline-in-asian-american-enrollment-at-princeton-yale-and-duke-sparks-legal-scrutiny-report-12825490.html,World," September 19, 2024 / 15:13   ","There has been a notable decline in the enrollment of Asian American in three universities - Princeton, Yale and Duke this year compared with last year, according to an advocacy group- Students for Fair Admissions, a News York Times report said. The revelation surfaced after Students for Fair Admissions sent letters to the schools on Tuesday their compliance with the Supreme Court's recent ruling on admissions. Earlier, the group had sued Harvard to end affirmative action in university admissions last year. It now aims to scrutinize whether schools are adhering to the new regulations and to file lawsuits if it believes that they are not. The group, a nonprofit opposing race-based admissions that represented Asian students in the lawsuit against Harvard, appears poised to act as an enforcer of the court's ruling. Additionally, the report noted slight changes in Black and Hispanic enrollment at Princeton, Yale, and Duke in the first class admitted since the Supreme Court struck down race-conscious admissions policies. The letters signed by the president of Students for Fair Admissions, Edward Blum stated, “Based on S.F.F.A.’s extensive experience, your racial numbers are not possible under true neutrality,”, adding ,“You are now on notice. Preserve all potentially relevant documents and communications.” Following the threats of the advocacy group, William Jacobson, a Cornell law professor and founder of the Equal Protection Project, suggested that the fight will now move away from policies to what is happening in the admission offices. Meanwhile, responding to the outfit's letters, a spokeswoman for Princeton on Tuesday said that the varsity has 'carefully adhered to the rules set by the Supreme Court.'

Israel-Hamas war latest: Israel turns its focus north toward Lebanon and Hezbollah,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/israel-hamas-war-latest-israel-turns-its-focus-north-toward-lebanon-and-hezbollah-12825363.html,World," September 19, 2024 / 13:25   ","Israel’s defense minister has declared the start of a “new phase” of the war as Israel turns its focus toward the northern front against Hezbollah militants in Lebanon. Two waves of explosive attacks hit Syria and Lebanon: an apparent Israeli attack targeting pagers used by Hezbollah that killed at least 12 and wounded nearly 3,000 on Tuesday, and exploding walkie-talkies and other electronics Wednesday across Lebanon that killed at least 20 people and injured 450 others. “We are at the start of a new phase in the war — it requires courage, determination and perseverance,” Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told troops on Wednesday. The head of Hezbollah’s Executive Council promised the group would respond to Tuesday’s pager explosion attack with “special punishment.” Hezbollah began striking Israel almost immediately after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack that sparked the Israel-Hamas war. Since then, Israel and Hezbollah have exchanged fire daily, coming close to a full-blown war on several occasions and forcing tens of thousands on both sides of the border to evacuate their homes. Gaza’s Health Ministry says more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. The ministry does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count but says a little over half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Japanese wireless communication equipment-maker Icom says it cannot confirm whether a walkie-talkie used in the explosive attacks against Hezbollah was related to the company, noting that the production and sales of that device and its battery were discontinued about a decade ago. The Osaka-based Icom was responding Thursday to a report that said one of the walkie-talkies used in the attacks a day earlier had a sticker with the company’s logo. Icom also noted that the device in question did not have an anti-counterfeit hologram sticker, which all authentic Icom products should be carrying. Company executive Yoshiki Enomoto told Japanese television NTV he was “surprised” by the news. He said the company could not confirm if the unit in question was Icom-made. “This specific device had a lot of fake copies out in the market,” he said, adding that company officials could only determine its authenticity if they see its circuits. Icom said the wireless radio unit IC-V82 was once manufactured for export including to the Middle East from 2004 to October 2014. But the production and shipment of its main unit ended about 10 years ago and batteries for the main units have also been discontinued. The company said its export models are only distributed through official sales representatives under rigid export control rules set by the Japanese Trade Ministry. All Icom radio equipment is manufactured by its subsidiary, Wakayama Icom Inc., under strict security controls that only allow use of authorized parts. The products are only manufactured at the Wakayama plant in Japan, Icom said.

India to be third largest economy by 2030-31; grow 6.7% per annum: S&P Global,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/india-to-be-third-largest-economy-by-2030-31-grow-6-7-per-annum-sp-global-12825747.html,Economy," September 19, 2024 / 18:29   ","The Indian economy will grow 6.7 percent annually between now and 2030-31 or become the third largest economy in the world, S&P Global said on September 19. “India’s medium-term prospects are healthy and filled with opportunities in multiple sectors including trade, agriculture, and AI, likely structural reforms and growing energy demands. India is poised for growth, and with a young and dynamic workforce well-positioned to shape the global economic landscape,” said Abhishek Tomar, Head- S&P Global India Leadership Council. S&P Global forecasts the Indian economy to grow 6.8 percent in the current fiscal. The economy grew 6.7 percent in the first quarter, buoyed by steady manufacturing and rise in the services economy. In the first edition of its report titled “ India Forward: Emerging Perspectives”, the global research firm noted that continued reforms were necessary to boost private investment and reduce reliance on public capital. India’s capex surge has largely been driven by public capex, which is expected to grow in double digits in FY25 as well. The report noted that the country needed to develop infrastructure and geopolitical strategies to maximise trade benefits and urged it to look for sustainable energy alternatives to cater to its growing population. “Addressing the twin challenges of air pollution and climate change will help deliver a high-quality, high-growth economy to the world’s largest democracy,” the report noted. It also pointed out the need to leverage AI to boost growth prospects further. ""The equity markets are expected to stay dynamic and competitive due to strong growth prospects and better regulation. Foreign inflows into Indian government bonds have surged since the country joined major emerging market indexes, with further growth anticipated,"" S&P Global stated. The report noted further noted there's a need to contain risks rising from food inflation, which may keep consumption muted. “Equally important is the limiting of food inflation by addressing structural bottlenecks and climate risks, as well as fostering conditions for supportive monetary policy,” it said. India’s food inflation rose again in August, leading to overall inflation rising to 3.65 percent compared with 3.6 percent in the previous month.

Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | Takeaways from Jerome Powell’s bold 50 bps rate cut,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-pro-panorama-takeaways-from-jerome-powell-bold-50-bps-rate-cut-12825214.html,Economy," September 19, 2024 / 14:59   ","Dear Reader, The Panorama newsletter is sent to Moneycontrol Pro subscribers on market days. It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of.  Strangely, the US Federal Reserve’s larger-than-expected rate cut of 50 basis points (bps) does not seem to have put investors in a celebratory mood. On the contrary, US equities ended lower on Wednesday after an initial surge in benchmarks. At the time of writing, Asian indices portrayed mixed sentiments and Indian benchmarks were lacklustre. One reason could be the typical ‘sell on news’ phenomenon as the much-awaited cycle of lower interest rates is now a reality. But this is not all. The divergence between the outsized rate cut to ensure that inflation is kept in check while joblessness doesn’t tick higher also shows that there is some concern among the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members of growth rates slipping and slowing even if recession fears can be comfortably brushed aside. “We’re trying to achieve a situation where we restore price stability without the kind of painful increase in unemployment that has come sometimes with disinflation,” was Powell’s calibrated comment in the post-meeting press conference. Powell’s cautious stance suggests that while this big bang rate cut may be a one-off, the FOMC’s future decisions will hinge on data points rather than the dot-plot. For now, another 50 bps in calendar year 2024 is what economists concur on. In any case, given that some of the other central banks such as the European Central Bank had already started cutting rates and this week could see more decisions in this direction, it marks the end of the pandemic-era high interest rate woes. For emerging markets, specifically for India, the rate cut raises hopes of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) following the Fed, though perhaps not at its next meet. Market consensus points to a 25 bps rate cut by the RBI in December that would kickstart the 75-100 bps cuts over a year as it steers domestic inflation towards the targeted 4 per cent mark. MCPro’s edition today has a series of articles on the key takeaways for investors in financial markets. Foreign institutional investors (FII) fund flows will increase and there will be a surge of liquidity in Indian equity markets, says Anubhav Sahu in this article. Already, anticipating a rate cut, September 2024 FII net inflows were Rs 31,000 crore amounting to 42 percent of the FII net inflows in CY24. Veteran emerging market investor Mark Mobius, in an interview with CNBC International, said that in spite of high valuation concerns in the mid- and small-cap space, he is still upbeat on India. With FII flows, perhaps one could see a rotation out of mid- and small-cap stocks and into the large-cap favourites. That said, Indian equities which have outperformed S&P on a 5-year basis are also trading at price-to-earnings multiple that is ahead of the 15-year mean value. Meanwhile, expectations of rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve had already added to the bond market’s optimism along with the index inclusion earlier. But, while India’s bond investors love the Fed’s rate cuts, they must show a greater appreciation towards the RBI for keeping a steady exchange rate, says my colleague Aparna Iyer. Read why here. Another interesting read by Dinesh Unnikrishnan talks about the impact of the expected rate cut by RBI on the banking sector. It could see near-term stress on banks’ profit margins, but could augur well for asset quality. To sum up, the much awaited rate cut cycle is now real. How fast and in what doses the central banks across the world deliver to complete the task of reining in inflation while supporting economic growth, will drive financial markets.

Real Estate Investment Trusts or REITs are a sound vehicle to gain exposure to the real estate sector and various stakeholders, including the capital market regulator, have been pitching it in various forums. The recent past, however, has seen the regulator becoming a bit less vocal on the instrument for obvious reasons. While speaking at a capital market conference recently, SEBI chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch had jokingly said that if she talks about REITs then she will be accused of â€˜conflict of interestâ€™. So, it was a welcome change when recently a whole-time member of SEBI prodded the REITs industry to promote the instrument and even work on a catchy line â€“ likeÂ â€˜Mutual Funds Sahi Haiâ€™. Conflict or no conflict,Â REITs Bhi Sahi Hai!  An eye for the markets Dr Agarwalâ€™s Health Care Ltd, which is the holding company of the listed entity Dr Agarwal's Eye Hospital is set to file a draft document for an initial public offer (IPO) in the next couple of weeks. The Chennai-based entity has already appointed Kotak Mahindra Bank and Morgan Stanley as investment bankers for the planned issue. It had earlier raised over Rs 1,000 crore from TPG Growth and Temasek and the IPO will provide these two investors, among others, an exit opportunity. The two global investors collectively hold a majority stake of around 60 percent in Dr Agarwalâ€™s Health Care and have participated in two fund-raising rounds since May 2022. Auto makers look to strike a balance For many months now, auto makers have been facing the issue of huge inventory pile-ups and with the festive season fast approaching, the time has come to launch new models as well. Thatâ€™s a rough road for auto makers to drive on. Market insiders say that most of the auto manufacturers are looking to strike a balance by offering huge discounts on existing models and also cutting down on the roll outs in terms of overall supply. For example, if a company planned to roll out 1Â lakh units of a new launch, it would only do, say 60,000 or even less. Not the best of scenarios for car makers but one needs to look ahead while also keeping an eye on the rear-view mirror.

US Federal Reserve’s uncertain destination troubles the bond market,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/us-federal-reserves-uncertain-destination-troubles-the-bond-market-12825006.html,Economy," September 19, 2024 / 09:18   ","The Federal Reserve on Wednesday began its policy easing with a bang. Much of the focus was on its decision to cut interest rates by half a percentage point from a two-decade high. But the key question for the bond market is where rates will land once all is said and done. Nobody knows for sure, and Chair Jerome Powell injected enough uncertainty to ensure a choppy ride ahead. The Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections showed that the median respondent among Federal Reserve Board members and Federal Reserve Bank presidents now sees the “longer-run” federal funds rate landing at around 2.9%, up from about 2.8% in its previous quarterly update. That’s the rate that policymakers think will prevail in a balanced economy with a strong labour market and low and stable inflation. For years, policymakers thought that “neutral” was around 2.5% (or 0.5% in “real” terms, adjusting for inflation at 2%). Not only have their estimates drifted higher, but I suspect that they could climb a bit more to converge with the median private sector estimate of 3.1% in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s survey of primary dealers. My Bloomberg Opinion colleague Bill Dudley, the president of the New York Fed from 2009-2018, told me Wednesday that neutral is probably around 3% to 3.5% — and could be as high as 4%. The upshot is that longer-term bond yields don’t have much room to fall in the near-term unless the economy weakens materially. The developments help explain why yields on the 10-year Treasury note actually rose by five basis points after the Fed’s decision. In theory, “neutral” is believed to be a function of slow-moving factors including demographics and productivity, but it’s very hard to know what it is in real time. Estimates of the rate started to increase meaningfully in 2023, in large part because the economy didn’t react as expected to the Fed’s aggressive rate increases. The assumption was that if you could raise rates from near zero to 5.25%-5.5% and still have gross domestic product expanding at around 2.5% and an unemployment rate below 4%, perhaps policy wasn’t as “restrictive” as people previously thought. Of course, it’s also important to distinguish short-term factors from longer-run ones: At the time, millions of households were still reaping the benefits of excess savings and ultra-low pandemic-era mortgages. But those aren’t permanent features of the US economy, and, since then, the unemployment rate has climbed from 3.4% in early 2023 to 4.2%. In other words, it’s getting harder to argue that the rate hikes aren’t working at all. There’s still a decent argument for a higher neutral rate, but it’s a moving target. Powell acknowledged as much at his press conference, in response to a question from Christopher Rugaber of the Associated Press: There are model based approaches and empirically based approaches that estimate what the neutral rate will be at any given time. But realistically we know it by its works. He also gave this response to Fox Business journalist Edward Lawrence concerning the odds that policy rates would return to the near-zero levels seen after the financial crisis and during the Covid-19 pandemic (emphasis mine): Intuitively many, many people would say we’re probably not going back to that era where there were trillions of dollars of sovereign bonds trading at negative rates, long-term bonds trading at negative rates… and it looked like the neutral rate might even be negative… It seems that’s so far away now. My own sense is that we’re not going back to that. But you know honestly, we’re going to find out. But it feels to me that the neutral rate is probably significantly higher than it was back then. How high is it? I just don’t think we know. Again, we only know it by its works. All in all, there’s plenty worth celebrating in Wednesday’s Fed announcement. It’s a signal that the inflation dragon has been mostly slain. The size of the cut is a reminder that policymakers stand ready to support the labour market and head off any meaningful economic weakening. But over in the bond market, it sure looks like the party is just about over (at least for now). Members of the Fed’s rate-setting committee think that neutral interest rates are a bit higher than before, and that puts a floor under longer-term bond yields for the foreseeable future.

Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | TrafikSol IPO debacle puts the spotlight on SME listing scrutiny,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-pro-panorama-trafiksol-ipo-debacle-puts-the-spotlight-on-sme-listing-scrutiny-12824601.html,Economy," September 18, 2024 / 15:41   ","Dear Reader, The Panorama newsletter is sent to Moneycontrol Pro subscribers on market days. It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of.Â  In a rare and alarming turn of events, the listing of TrafikSol ITS Technologies was abruptly postponed, even after the company successfully raised funds through its IPO. TrafikSol's Rs 44.87 crore issue, oversubscribed by a staggering 318 times in the retail category, was halted at the last moment by the BSE. The exchange, citing concerns, delayed the listing and froze the use of the funds, which are now locked in an escrow account. The grey market premium of 135 percent disappeared overnight following this intervention. This incident underscores a larger issue within India's SME segmentâ€”funds are being raised without sufficient oversight. While SEBI regulates capital markets, the exchanges have been entrusted with the task of scrutinising companies listing on the SME platform. The onus falls on the exchanges, which are themselves in fierce competition to attract business. In this competitive landscape, it appears that proper vetting has taken a backseat. In TrafikSol's case, red flags were raised when the company sought investors' funds. Around 40 percent of the issue's proceedsâ€”Rs 17.7 croreâ€”were earmarked for the acquisition of software from a company called Oasis Corpcare. Oasis, a firm with a paltry equity capital of Rs 1 lakh and a focus on auditing and book-keeping, had failed to file its own financial reports since 2021. Such glaring issues only came to light after being flagged on social media, which forced the BSE to take last-minute action to halt the listing. This episode shines a harsh spotlight on the governance of SME IPOs. Companies looking to raise funds through the SME platform should at least pass the smell test. While it's true that the systems required for listing on the main board may be too stringent for smaller enterprises, a minimum level of due diligence is essential, particularly when it concerns the use of investor funds. Recognising these issues, SEBI is now considering tightening the norms for SME listings. However, this could be a double-edged sword. While better scrutiny is needed, overly strict regulations could dissuade smaller companies from using the SME platform altogether. For instance, the NSE recently introduced a rule requiring companies to show positive free cash flows for two out of the last three years. Such a stringent criterion may exclude many growth-oriented firms, particularly those still at the early stages of scaling up. Not many companies in the secondary market would meet this criterion. A growth company at its early stages typically needs to allocate all available funds towards scaling and executing its business plans. As a result, only a limited number of companies will meet the stringent criteria set by the exchange for listing, as such requirements often demand financial metrics that young, fast-growing firms may not yet achieve. There's no question that SME exchanges must better scrutinise the companies they list, but there's a delicate balance to strike. If regulations become too restrictive, they could undermine the very purpose of the SME platformâ€”providing smaller companies with a viable means to raise capital. Tighter norms would likely drive these companies towards private equity or alternative financing routes, further limiting their growth opportunities. The TrafikSol fiasco is a cautionary tale. It reveals the urgent need for a stronger regulatory framework that ensures basic governance standards are met while maintaining the flexibility necessary for smaller enterprises to thrive. In the end, the goal should be a balance between protecting investors and fostering a supportive environment for India's growing SME sector. If stricter regulations are imposed, companies may have to rely on private equity funds or other forms of private financing to meet their capital needs. This shift would exclude retail investors from the opportunity to invest in small, high-growth companies at an early stage, thereby limiting their access to potentially lucrative investment opportunities that could generate substantial returns.

GST legacy issues can undermine government’s efforts to ease tax structure,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/gst-legacy-issues-can-undermine-governments-efforts-to-ease-tax-structure-12824400.html,Economy," September 18, 2024 / 15:05   ","By Shivam Mehta and Tanya Garg Amidst the trend of decisions being taken in GST Council meetings, taxpayers have been staying hopeful and are banking heavily on the Council to alleviate hardships being faced by them. A couple of significant decisions taken in the previous Council meeting include reduction of GST rates on life saving cancer drugs from 12 percent to 5 percent and clarification that GST rates on services of transportation of passengers by helicopters will attract 5 percent tax. Relief in insurance sector is also on the cards since a Group of Ministers (GoM) has been constituted to look into the rate change. Even if the aforementioned decisions were truly in favour of taxpayers, some decisions have created another set of hassles and left them in a confused state such as GST rates on extruded products, car seats, exemption to foreign airlines etc. The GST rate on extruded/expanded savoury food products has been a subject matter of debate as the industry has been classifying them under CTH 2106 asÂ namkeenÂ and discharging 12 percent GST while tax authorities are of the view that these are classifiable under CTH 1905 attracting 18 percent GST, as indicated in the circular issued in 2023. ThoughÂ it has been recommended that such products, though classifiable under CTH 1905 will attract 12 percent GST prospectively, no relief, so far has been granted for the past period, leaving ongoing litigations unsettled. Moreover, if the industry takes a decision to discharge 12 percent GST prospectively under CTH 1905, the possibility of jeopardising the past litigations cannot be ruled out. Thus, is it important that this change is reviewed comprehensively and implemented carefully by tax payers. A seat is a seat? Another rate rationalisation attempt, which has left the taxpayers in a perplexed state is the GST rates on car seats being increased to 28 percent. The press release indicates that the said rate is being proposed to bring parity with seats of motorcycles which already attract GST rate of 28 percent. While GST rate of 28 percent on car seats may itself be a cost to the industry or taxpayers ultimately, the bigger concern is the comment made with respect to motorcycle seats stating that it already attracts 28 percent GST. The GST rate on motorcycle seats is already under litigation since most of players have been discharging 18 percent GST on it. Though the representations filed by industry seeking relief for the past was already on the table of the Council, issuance of the aforementioned clarification has aggravated the situation. Unless intervened by the Council or government in the form of clarification/exemption for the past, getting appropriate relief for motorcycle seats from courts may become an uphill task considering inconsistent clarifications issued with respect to this matter. Beware unintended consequences Similarly, the exemption granted to foreign airlines has, yet again, stirred up controversy for other industries, and has sparked doubts as to whether such exemption is warranted in similar cases (other than airlines) of import of services. Though the Council is gearing towards tackling the concerns of the taxpayers, careful decision making is highly warranted, in absence of which, the benefits meant for the taxpayers may turn into miseries. The recent clarifications also demonstrate that a thoughtful decision must be made by the taxpayers as to whether to approach the Council in an ongoing litigation or leave such matters to be decided by courts, offering relief and shaping jurisprudence. Moreover, it is the right time for GST council meetings to prioritize issues which are of national importance impacting consumer/public at large such as rate rationalisation, bringing ease in GST compliance etc. (Shivam Mehta is Executive Partner and Tanya Garg is Principal Associate at Lakshmikumaran & Sridharan, a law firm.)

This is the focus area of the new government,” Barthwal said in a media briefing on achievements of the Union government's completion of 100 days. India has set a goal of achieving $2 trillion in trade by 2030, of which 50 percent would have to come from services. “We want at least a 10 percent share in e-commerce exports. In the next five years, we should reach the $200-billion mark as the World crosses $2 trillion in e-commerce exports,” Barthwal further added underlining the importance of e-commerce exports. The government is also targeting to take organic exports to $1 billion by FY26. Earlier this year, it had announced a revamp of National Programme of Organic Production. Earlier this month, the government launched a one-stop solution for trade, where Indian exporters can view opportunities available in other countries. It also announced the BHASKAR platform to register start-ups and bring all start-ups, investors and other parts of the ecosystem on the same platform. “The aim of the government has been to improve ease of doing business, transparency, efficiency and focus on MSMEs,” said L Satya Srinivas, Additional Secretary, Department of Commerce. The government has increased the insurance cover for MSME exporters, which is expected to help provide Rs 20,000 crore of credit at low cost.

Inequality isn’t the problem. Uneven growth is,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/inequality-isnt-the-problem-uneven-growth-is-12823756.html,Economy," September 17, 2024 / 16:22   ","Growing economic inequality is either “a major issue of our time” or “a defining challenge of our time,” depending on your taste for hyperbole. Given America’s recent experience, however, I would like to call for a timeout. What matters is not so much the level of inequality as how we narrow the gap: The important thing is to create the conditions for widespread growth. After years of a widening gap between the rich and poor in the US, income inequality is finally narrowing — and yet few Americans are happy about the state of the economy. Inequality shrank only because middle and high earners experienced real wage drops, while low earners did better. In the last four years, lower-income Americans experienced significant wage gains. The bottom 10% saw their wages increase 8% after accounting for inflation. But almost everyone else did worse: Median income earners’ wages fell and are now where they were in 2020, while the top earners had a 6% real wage cut. The result is a decline in wage inequality. In 2019, the top 10% earned about eight times more than the bottom 10%. By 2024, that had dropped to seven times more. The top 10% earned 2.6 times more than the median in 2020, but 2.5 times more in 2024. What’s more, this fall in inequality was not the result of a deliberate policy. It was mostly due to the return of inflation, which was in part caused by policy errors and high debt. The resulting inflation wiped out nominal wage gains for most Americans but not for lower-skilled workers, for which there was a labor shortage. Lower-paid workers tend to have jobs that need to be done in person, and the demand for services (restaurants and hotels, for example) spiked as the US emerged from the pandemic. So lower earners’ wages increased enough to outpace inflation, but no one else’s did. The last half-decade shows what has been missing in America’s ongoing conversation about inequality. Economic inequality does feel unfair, but it has never been clear what economic problems it causes. Economists have traditionally argued that there is a trade-off between equity and growth. If you redistribute so everyone is equal, you’ll reduce incentives to innovate, work hard and take risks — and that means a less efficient and slower-growing economy. That makes everyone poorer, even if it also makes them more equal. When the debate is focused on reducing inequality, however, such concerns get little attention. Europe’s experience is also instructive. The continent is starting to address its unsustainable combination of slow growth, stagnant innovation and an aging population. A recent report urges Europe’s governments to better coordinate and ease up on regulation, even as another analysis raises the question of whether high growth is simply inconsistent with the economic and social-welfare policies of many European governments. It is worth noting that in the last few years, the US economy enjoyed robust growth and a booming stock market — but neither of these translated into higher living standards for most Americans. Nevertheless, the European experience and the recent narrowing inequality in the US offers some valuable lessons. The first is that the economy is not zero sum. Rich people don’t necessarily get that way by taking from poor people. In the last few years, wealthier Americans lost ground in part because their skills had relatively less value and they chose to work fewer hours and at home. Middle earners were mostly just swamped by inflation, while low earners found their work in high demand. The point is, no one got more or less at the expense of anyone else. The second lesson is there are indeed costs to reducing inequality, and trade-offs to be weighed. But that needn’t mean the US has to choose between more equality or more prosperity. It can have the best of both so long as Americans accept the economy as a dynamic system that has the potential to make everyone better off — just not always at the same rate. While the last few decades have favored high earners, for example, that may change if AI replaces knowledge workers and the post-pandemic trend of high demand for service workers continues. In that case, market forces will compress wages, shrinking inequality without policy intervention. The goal for policy should be inclusive growth. Alas, it is not currently in vogue politically. High tariffs and attempts to revive low-skill manufacturing may create some jobs, but they will only worsen inflation, which hits the entire middle class the hardest. Taxing unrealized capital gains may reduce inequality, but it will also take money out of productive investments, hampering growth and innovation (and adding to inflation as well). Any policy intended to lessen inequality should also facilitate innovation and the development of human capital. The goal is to grow the pie, rather than just divide it more equally. There are a lot of policies that encourage inclusive growth: improving the quality of education, for example, or making it easier for people to move and change jobs. People can disagree about how to achieve these goals, of course, and debate their relative importance. But talking about just inequality on its own is unlikely to get us very far.

Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | Will Bajaj Housing Finance's sparkling debut rub off on peers?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-pro-panorama-will-bajaj-housing-finances-sparkling-debut-rub-off-on-peers-12823652.html,Economy," September 17, 2024 / 15:23   ","Dear Reader, The Panorama newsletter is sent to Moneycontrol Pro subscribers on market days. It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of.  The stellar listing of Bajaj Housing Finance highlights the stark contrast in valuations of housing finance stocks. LIC Housing Finance, the company with the largest asset book, is trading at a discount to its one year forward estimated book value. In comparison, Bajaj Housing Finance is now valued at 6.2 times FY26 estimated book value. Bajaj Housing Finance’s valuations are out of whack and reflect the euphoria in the primary market. Investors looking to bet on housing finance can find relatively cheaper options in companies such as Repco Home Finance, India Shelter, Home First Finance and Aadhar Housing Finance, write Neha Dave and Khushboo Rai. The stocks are trading at around 2 to 3 times the FY26 estimated book value. “We aren’t suggesting investors to buy stock just because of low valuations, but they should rather take a calculated risk,” add Dave and Rai. Do read to find out their order of preferred companies. Still, at less than 1 time the FY26 estimated book value, LIC Housing Finance is cheaper in the current context. However, the question is if LIC Housing Finance can catch investor fancy. Much depends on revival of growth rates. Shares of LIC Housing Finance de-rated as growth rates at the company moderated. Assets under management increased by a modest 4 percent in the past two quarters. Loans at Bajaj Housing Finance, Home First Finance and Aadhar Housing Finance grew at a significantly better pace in FY19-24. LIC Housing Finance aims to grow its assets under management in double digits or more than 10 percent in FY25. But expectations are muted. The improvement in net interest margins (NIM) seen in recent years can reverse if the company has to reprice its loan book. “Around 99 percent of the loan book for LIC Housing Finance is floating in nature, highest amongst NBFC/ HFCs. Hence, in case of any rate cuts, its asset should re-price faster than liabilities (due to its longer tenure of borrowings) and thus, it should see the maximum negative impact to its NIMs,” warn analysts at Nomura. The concerns are weighing on valuations of the LIC Housing Finance stock. As such, shares of state-owned entities trade at a discount to peers. This is reflected in the bank and insurance sectors. Companies in the private sector tend to adopt aggressive business practices and achieve superior growth rates. While one cannot expect LIC Housing Finance to match the growth rates of private peers, improvement in key business metrics can add heft to stock valuations.

The US is locked in a state of debt denial,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/the-us-is-locked-in-a-state-of-debt-denial-12823589.html,Economy," September 17, 2024 / 14:29   ","Perhaps it’s unsurprising that Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are saying nothing about the country’s biggest economic-policy challenge – namely, how to rein in public borrowing. With an election to win, they’d rather emphasize lower taxes and/or higher public spending. In a deeply divided country, where everybody has chosen sides and defeating the enemy is all that counts, there’s no place for budget hand-wringing and hard choices involving trade-offs and compromise. Yet rest assured difficult choices are coming, one way or another. Asked how he went bankrupt, one of Ernest Hemingway’s characters famously said, “Gradually and then suddenly.” It’s the same with governments. American fiscal policy is firmly on course for default – and every delay in confronting this prospect makes it harder to avoid. This truth is obscured not just by political warfare but also by the way forecasts of public debt are put together. The most recent “current law” projections from the Congressional Budget Office show net public debt rising from roughly 100% of gross domestic product this year to a little over 120% within 10 years. Unfortunately, this is very much a best-case scenario. For a start, it’s already out of date. The latest fiscal numbers show a still-widening deficit, partly due to higher interest rates. (Annual interest costs will top $1 trillion this year for the first time.) In addition, the projections assume that the tax cuts passed during the Trump administration in 2017 will expire on schedule at the end of next year – a provision characteristic of US fiscal policy, in that its only purpose was to camouflage that measure’s true budget implications. Trump has promised that the tax cuts will be extended; Harris says taxes won’t rise for most taxpayers. Full extension would add another $4 trillion or so to the 10-year deficit – only a bit less than all the revenue raised last year. By law, the CBO assumes that Social Security, Medicare and other so-called mandatory programs continue to be funded even as their associated trust funds are exhausted. The implications for the deficit are disguised by downward pressure on discretionary spending on defense, law enforcement, transportation and so forth, which are obliged to shrink as a share of the economy. (It’s more likely that defense spending, in particular, will need to grow as a share of the economy, perhaps substantially.) The projections also assume steady economic growth, no recessions and no spikes in the cost of government borrowing. That last point is crucial. Because of the role that interest rates play in debt dynamics, projections of unsustainable public debt are, in a sense, delusional. The models driving the projections have to treat the budget problem as about-to-be-solved even if it isn’t: Instead of “Assume a can-opener,” the models are told “Assume a politically toxic tax increase.” Without some such policy breakthrough, called a closure rule, the models crash: Investors see that the government will go bust given current policy, so they demand higher interest rates, the deficit widens, and the debt accelerates; interest rates therefore rise more, the deficit widens and the fiscal collapse moves from “at some point eventually” to “What just happened?” In effect, the forecasters are forced to rig their models by making the simulations assume that despite all indications to the contrary, no matter how big the debt gets, Washington will somehow solve the problem before investors panic. This computationally necessary over-optimism is worrisome enough. What’s worse is that the debt can get so big that it’s insupportable regardless of last-minute magical breakthroughs. Recent work on the Penn Wharton Budget Model suggests that the US, given its particular characteristics (not least a low savings rate), couldn’t sustain a debt ratio of more than 200% of GDP under any circumstances. At that point, the taxes needed to stabilize the debt would be so huge they would tank the economy. The PWBM’s economists add that 200% is an outer limit based on favorable assumptions. “A more plausible value is closer to 175%, and even then it assumes that financial markets believe the government will eventually implement an efficient closure rule.” As soon as this heroic refusal to face reality falters, things will unravel. The key point is that this maximum value is not the largest amount of debt that the US can safely sustain; the debt is already more than the country can safely sustain. Rather, according to the logic of the model, it’s the point at which default shifts from being hard to avoid to impossible to avoid. This point of no return might still seem quite distant – but for years’ successive debt projections have been ratcheting toward it and there’s no sign this will change. A recession and/or shift of mood in financial markets would seriously worsen the arithmetic. Pushing the debt back down would already be challenging, supposing that anybody was minded to try, which nobody is. And the task is getting harder all the time. The UK’s new Labour government based its election campaign partly on the fiscal irresponsibility of its Conservative predecessor. Having promised to grapple with the problem, it’s struggling to come up with good answers, but at least the goal is acknowledged and an effort is under way. America’s politicians continue to ignore the issue altogether. And they aren’t being called out for it – not by voters, not by the press and (with surprisingly few exceptions) not even by expert analysts. Preoccupied with vicious partisan warfare, the country is locked in a state of debt denial. It won’t end well. Credit: Bloomberg  "
China’s best growth target may be none at all,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/chinas-best-growth-target-may-be-none-at-all-12823564.html,Economy," September 17, 2024 / 13:27   ","Disappointing economic news is becoming a reliable indicator in China. Another round of monthly reports point to an economy that isn’t falling apart, but is far softer than officials are comfortable with. The worn — and still very accurate — conclusion is that more stimulus is required to meet targets laid out by President Xi Jinping. The story is starting to feel a bit stale. Every now and then, however, there is something in the mix worthy of extra attention. That was the case when Xi appeared to water down his commitment to meeting the hallowed goal for growth this year, which is around 5%. The People's Bank of China then took the rare step of issuing a statement accompanying poor figures on credit. These lines fed speculation that interest rates will be reduced soon, perhaps alongside new measures to crank up the expansion. This would be welcome, though the central bank has a record of extreme caution. First, the latest batch of data, released on Saturday: Retail sales climbed less than anticipated, industrial production missed estimates, investment was soft, and unemployment inched higher. Monday postmortems called for greater attention from Beijing to address the dour picture, while simultaneously predicting that any response would be unequal to the task. Ocean liners like the Chinese economy, the world's second largest, don't just change course immediately. What if the Communist Party's growth target didn't matter quite so much? As China's expansion slowed from the heady clip of the late 1990s and early 2000s, when double-digit advances weren’t uncommon, the objective has become more challenging. The risk is that officials, especially in the provinces, pursue projects of doubtful value, but contribute to meeting the numbers. There has long been suspicion among investors that statistics are massaged to produce the right result. Top leaders, rarely inclined to set radically different goals from year to year, then get to make speeches lauding the performance. The practice of setting targets is long-standing. Beijing sensibly suspended it in 2020 as the pandemic descended. Gross domestic product eked out a gain of about 2% that year. The 5% target does provide for a small amount of latitude above or below, though it would be a brave cadre who assumed they had a pass. Falling too far below would indicate failure, though coming in above would likely be career enhancing. The consensus among private sector economists is that undershooting is likely. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. are among firms that think something in the high 4% range is realistic. Toning down the emphasis on 5% would have to come from the very top. Xi appeared to oblige on Thursday, saying that that officials should “strive to achieve"" the goal. In July, the party’s senior decision-making body demanded the aspiration be “resolutely"" met. There's debate as to whether the linguistic tweak reflects a shift in the underlying approach, but the president doesn't strike me as a person who wanders off script. Assuming Xi was signaling some tolerance, this is to be applauded. There's an argument to go further and scrap targets altogether. Also handy was the PBOC's dangling of initiatives to put a floor under the expansion. “We will make maintaining price stability and pushing for the mild rebound in prices an important consideration for monetary policy,” the bank said late Friday. All monetary authorities seek stable prices; in China's case, this means being more attuned to the risks of deflation. Consumer-price increases are hovering a bit above zero. Beijing also took some modest steps toward addressing the challenges of an aging society and a contracting labor force. The retirement age for men was raised by three years to 63, while women will retire at 55 and 58, depending on their roles. This won't move the needle on GDP any time soon. The changes will be phased in over more than a decade. But it is a recognition that China has a problem at both ends of the life spectrum: The country is producing fewer kids and folks are living longer. While notable and the first change in the retirement age since 1978, it's fair to ask whether this step comes too late. China waited a long time to bury the one-child policy and is now trying to lift the birthrate. Sometimes edicts work too well. Beginning to recognize that arbitrary GDP targets aren't sacrosanct is healthy. It has the added advantage of reflecting reality. Credit: Bloomberg  "

Many institutions are getting impacted and the latest one to face the brunt is a global financial powerhouse whose name, many believe, is worth its weight in “gold”. The gravity of the matter can be gauged from the fact that the financial major was forced to issue a public statement, warning the general public to “exercise extreme caution” as fake websites and social media groups using the brand’s logo etc have come up and trying to convince people into investing in fraudulent schemes. Gold does come with a lot of glitter, or litter in this case.  Action never ends in the SME IPO segment The average size of an SME IPO may well be a fraction of a mainboard issue but in terms of action and excitement, it is in multiples of their larger counterparts. While the regulator and exchanges are closely monitoring the segment, potential issuers and bankers operating in the SME segment are spooked by a recent development. On Monday, BSE directed that the entire proceeds of a recent SME IPO to be kept in an escrow account till complaints against the company are resolved “satisfactorily”. The exchange even went to the extent of postponing the listing date of the company, which would have definitely disturbed the strategy of many who would have been looking at making a quick buck by way of listing gains. This surely is a big warning for all SMEs looking to list in the future. Would the tribe of retail options sellers vanish? Discussions around the discussion paper by Sebi on F&O trading just doesn’t die down! The regulator received as many as 6,000 responses from market participants on the paper that was essentially aimed at tightening the bouquet of F&O products. While the final framework is yet to be announced, market players are already a worried lot. A separate analysis by Sebi showed that nearly 90 percent of the traders lose money in derivatives but many in the market believe that if the proposals put forth by the regulator in the discussion paper are finalised then the share of loss-making traders could only go up. They believe that the proposal of increasing the contract sizes for options could drive profitable retail option sellers out of the market. While the market is dominated by retail option buyers, a dearth of retail option sellers could disturb the market ecosystem, they say.

The logic of Modi’s economic reforms,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/the-logic-of-narendra-modis-economic-reforms-12823280.html,Economy," September 17, 2024 / 08:09   ","The last ten years under Prime Minister Modi have seen a large number of economic reforms that have made India the fastest growing major economy and brought it to the threshold of becoming the world’s third largest economy. While many articles have been written about individual reforms, it is important to get a sense of overall progress and the intellectual underpinnings of what is being attempted. The economy inherited by Prime Minister Modi in 2014 was the outcome of two decades of intermittent market-oriented reforms that had created a larger private sector but not a common internal market, world class infrastructure or a process of “creative destruction” crucial for an entrepreneurial culture. Moreover, there was the immediate threat of macro-economic instability resulting from the policy response to the Global Financial Crisis of 2007, including an irresponsible expansion of the financial system. The first term of Prime Minister Modi, therefore, needs to be seen as a response to these challenges. The first priority of the government was to anchor macro-economic policy and re-establish credibility. This led to the introduction of an inflation targeting framework in 2016 that established an explicit inflation target range of 2% to 6%. This has been a very successful framework as India has shifted from being a country that normally suffered inflation in the 8-12% range to one that rarely strays from the target range. Indeed, it performed better than most developed countries during the post-Covid inflation spike. The next problem was creating a common internal market. This required physical infrastructure but, more importantly, an indirect tax system that was evenly applied across the country. The solution was the Goods and Services Tax (GST) introduced in 2017. The inefficiencies of the new system is now often debated (and these issues do need to be resolved), but one should not forget how GST is a radical improvement on the earlier system. At around the same time, the government decided to use the brand new Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to clean up the banking system. This was a major innovation as IBC was untested and the conventional wisdom of that time was that non-performing assets (NPAs) should be shifted to a “Bad Bank”, and that banks should be quickly recapitalized in order to avert a systemic cash-flow gridlock. The government, however, took the view that a Bad Bank would just become a tax-payer funded warehouse for festering NPAs like the erstwhile Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction. Instead, IBC was used to directly sell-off NPAs. This decision dramatically changed India’s credit culture: many defaulters voluntarily repaid their loans even as NPAs were taken over by better management. The result is that India now has a healthy, well-capitalised banking system. The second term of Prime Minister Modi, unfortunately, was hit by the Covid-19 shock. Two years were lost fighting the pandemic but, even under duress, a large number of sectoral reforms were done. For instance the drones, space and geo-spatial mapping sectors were liberalized, and Air India was privatised. The liberalisation of agricultural markets, however, was rolled back due to political opposition. It is important to remember, nonetheless, that the economic logic of farm sector reforms has never been contested by any credible economist. As the country emerged from the Covid Crisis in 2022, the government embarked on a cycle of large-scale investment in infrastructure. Some of the projects were already underway, but a renewed effort was directed at highways, airports, railways and new public buildings. The new Parliament building was completed in 2023, two massive airports are nearing completion near Delhi and Mumbai, a complete overhaul of the transportation Mumbai’s system is underway, and so on. So, what are the new focus areas that are emerging? First, there now an explicit goal of making India a technology leader. This requires a research and development effort from both the government and the private sector. The intellectual property ecosystem is being revamped in anticipation of this shift (the patenting process, for instance, has been dramatically expanded). Similarly, a well-funded Anusandhan National Research Foundation has been established a few weeks ago. Other measures are in the pipeline. Second, Indian policy-making is being given a maritime orientation that has been oddly missing for a country with such a long coastline. A big effort is being made to expand ports as well as encourage ship-building, and vessel ownership. In August, Prime Minister laid the foundation stone of a brand new mega-port at Vadhavan, Maharashtra, that would entail an investment of Rs76,220 crores. Third, there is an effort to build out a safety-net (as opposed to freebies) for vulnerable segments of society. One example is the extension of the Ayushman Bharat health insurance of Rs5 lakhs to all senior citizens above the age of seventy. Of course, economic reforms are a continuous effort and many new policies and projects will be announced in the next few years to pave the way for a “Vikasit Bharat” by 2047. Major challenges remain such as the need to upgrade the administrative and legal system. However, this article will hopefully provide readers a flavour of how Prime Minister Modi and his policy-team think about the economic reform agenda.

Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | 25 or 50 bps? It’s a coin toss,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-pro-panorama-25-or-50-bps-its-a-coin-toss-12822804.html,Economy," September 16, 2024 / 15:57   ","Dear Reader, This week’s main event for markets is the US Fed’s decision on interest rates. Of course, it’s a foregone conclusion that rates will be cut, but to dismiss the importance of this event would be a mistake. For one, it caps a journey that began when COVID upended life globally in 2020. While protecting people’s health was the first priority, central bankers worked in their corner to protect the economy through monetary easing. Since it happened in a coordinated manner the network effect magnified its impact, the economy stayed healthy, asset prices inflated as money gushed into all available opportunities. Finally, COVID ended. But high inflation did a dance around central bankers trying to tame it, with even the US Fed getting it wrong on the inflation-being-transitory front. Geopolitics upended supply chains, making the fight tougher. But interest rates were hiked higher and higher till inflation was finally brought to heel and the economy was slowed down or even on the verge of a recession according to some indicators. After a long process of monetary whack-a-mole that tired out impatient investors, there appears to be enough confidence that inflation has durably settled at acceptable levels for the US to start cutting rates. The ECB has already commenced it. What are the signals for investors? My colleague Manas Chakravarty decodes them in this article, finding that the Fed Funds futures price in a rate cut as being certain, but are divided in the middle (probabilistically speaking) on whether the rate cut will be 25 or 50 basis points. Equity markets have moved modestly, but the bond markets have moved sharply. But the really interesting bit is this, that the Fed Funds futures are also factoring in a probability of more than 50 percent of a 200 bps cumulative cut in six months in the Fed Funds rate, to 3.25-3.5 percent. The FOMC, in contrast, has a median forecast of 4.1 percent at the end of 2025! That leaves enough of a spread for disappointment. Don’t miss Chakravarty’s piece, to know more about what could disappoint investors on September 18, how markets could react to the decision and most importantly, what the decision can mean for Indian investors (hint: the news ‘flow’ is good). The FT’s Colby Smith lays out in this piece (free to read for MC Pro subscribers) the scenarios facing the Fed, its ability to bring policy quickly into the neutral zone, the importance of communication by the Fed, US elections and it’s a fine balancing act that is needed from the US Fed. A former Fed official and currently a Yale professor, William English, puts it succinctly, “If they do 25 [basis points], they will want to be clear that they’re not just hopelessly behind the curve and oblivious to what’s going on in the economy, and that they’ll move quickly if they need to,” he said. “If they do 50 [basis points], they’ll want to be clear that they’re not on a really fast march to neutral.” “It’s easy to screw up in both directions,” he warned.

ONOE represents a disruptive move when federalism is under stress,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/onoe-represents-a-disruptive-move-when-federalism-is-under-stress-12825410.html,Politics," September 19, 2024 / 14:13   ","Bringing about legal changes to hold simultaneous elections across all levels of government, or â€˜One Nation, One Electionâ€™ (ONOE), and creating a common centralised electoral roll were promises made in the BJP manifesto ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha election. In keeping with the same, the union cabinet on September 18 decided to go ahead with the preparatory work for it. The foundation for a transition to ONOE was laid before the Lok Sabha election when a nine-member committee led by former president Ram Nath Kovind presented a report in March 2024 recommending it. The report laid out its reasons and also said that legal changes synchronising Lok Sabha and state assembly elections do not require the union government to get concurrence of state assemblies. Synchronising local body elections, however, will need the concurrence at the level of state assemblies. We have been there before Between 1951 and 1967, India witnessed ONOE. Subsequently, when the electorate didnâ€™t always give a decisive mandate, some governments didnâ€™t last their full course and elections became asynchronous. This happened in the natural course of Indiaâ€™s democratic evolution. Therefore, the current drive to ONOE is to reset democracy by terminating the life of most state assemblies before they finish their natural course (this needs to happen once). Not all political parties were in favour of this disruptive step. The Kovind Committee report said 15 of the 47 political parties, or 32 percent, it consulted did not favour ONOE. A disruption of this scale where the entire cost of transitioning to ONOE has to be borne by states needs a powerful reason. Arguments in favour The strongest arguments in favour of ONOE in the Kovind Committee report are the benefits to the administrative system which provides the manpower for the election machinery. These benefits includes less disruption for staff and some level of cost compression. The weak link The most unconvincing aspect of the Kovind Committee report is the attempt to link economic growth outcomes to simultaneous elections. The report sidesteps the most important aspect of Indiaâ€™s economic track record. The economic growth spurt of the last 44 years came when we had asynchronous elections. The report appears to incorrectly conflate policy stability with elections. They are often unrelated. To illustrate, in the 1990s, India had five prime ministers, but economic policy across governments displayed a level of consistency that produced significant benefits later. Federal argument As a transition to ONOE has clear downsides for states, there has to be a more comprehensive assessment of costs and benefits than what the Kovind Committee attempted.Â  The Committee was necessarily limited in its assessment because it had a narrow remit. The high point of Indian federalism was the transition to GST in 2017, which represented the efforts of four union governments and a willingness on the part of states to voluntarily forego unilateral taxation powers for a larger cause. Since then, federalism has been under stress. One area where itâ€™s clearly evident is in the presentations opposition-administered states have been making to the 16thÂ Finance Commission. The Commission is in the midst of information gathering prior to preparing its report. Its report will be tabled at a time when some states feel they have been getting a raw deal in the allocation of resources. To illustrate, in a presentation to the Finance Commission in August, the Karnataka government asked for all cess and surcharge levied by the union government to be capped at 5 percent of the gross tax revenue (GTR). The background to this demand is that cess and surcharge are excluded from the divisible pool of tax resources shared among centre and states. Opposition-administered are vocal in their displeasure with a growing level of cess and surcharge that make up GTR as it reduces the fiscal space they get to fulfil promises made in their state election manifesto. The case against ONOE ONOE represent a disruption rather than a revolution. The NDA government on September 18 justified its decision on starting the transition to ONOE by citing the recommendations of the Kovind Committee. To justify this level of disruption, we need benefits that are far greater than what the Kovind Committee detailed. The Committee, limited by its remit, ignores the current political environment in India and the stress that Centre-State relations are under. The scale of political costs of transition will depend heavily on the harmony between the union government and opposition-administered states. The one thing that is absolutely clear is that we have long left the goodwill that was needed to roll out GST behind us. Thereâ€™s bitterness in the relationship. That makes the case for a transition to ONOE weak as we are underestimating the political costs. Itâ€™s best to drop this idea now. Instead, a reset of Centre-State relations should be the priority.

"Why India needs to implement ‘One Nation, One Election’ policy",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/why-india-needs-to-implement-one-nation-one-election-policy-12825411.html,Politics," September 19, 2024 / 14:16   ","The Narendra Modi government has passed a cabinet resolution to pursue the ‘One Nation, One Election’ policy. If implemented, it isn’t going to be something new for the Indian polity. Elections to the Lok Sabha and legislative assemblies of states were mostly held simultaneously from 1951-52 to 1967. Interestingly, some of the state assemblies were dissolved in 1957 by the Congress government at the Centre to hold simultaneous polls, and this was done with consensus among all the political parties. The states whose assemblies were dissolved prior to completion of their term to facilitate simultaneous elections for the Lok Sabha and all state assemblies included Bihar, Bombay, Madras, Mysore, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. According to the ECI’s report on the Second General elections in India (Volume I), “The Commission called a conference of the All-India Political Parties in New Delhi on the November 13, 1956, to elicit their views on the most convenient period in February-March, 1957, for holding the general elections. The representatives of the political parties expressed themselves unanimously that the poll should be held continuously without any long break.” The ECI report in 1962 also advocated for simultaneous polls in concurrence with all the political parties. The Law Commission of India in its 170th Report on ‘Reforms of the Electoral Laws’ submitted way back in 1999, observed that: “This cycle of elections every year, and in the out of season, should be put an end to. We must go back to the situation where the elections to Lok Sabha and all the Legislative Assemblies are held at once. It is true that we cannot conceive or provide for all the situations and eventualities that may arise whether on account of the use of Article 356 (which of course has come down substantially after the decision of the Supreme Court in S.R. Bommai vs Union of India) or for other reasons, yet the holding of a separate election to a Legislative Assembly should be an exception and not the rule. The rule ought to be ‘one election once in five years for Lok Sabha and all the Legislative Assemblies.”  The Law Commission reports in 2015 and 2018 also favoured simultaneous polls.  The annual Report of Election Commission of India in 1983 also advocated for ‘One Nation One Election Policy’. In September, 1982 the Commission recommended holding simultaneous elections to the House of the People and the Legislative Assemblies of States for the following weighty reasons: (1) Considerable saving on the colossal avoidable administrative and other expenditure incurred on account of holding of separate General elections (2) Substantial economy through revision of electoral rolls for the House of the People and the State Legislative Assemblies simultaneously instead of undertaking them on a countrywide basis twice over in two different operations. (3) For the conduct of elections, civilian personnel running into about twenty-five lakhs of officers and staff and a few lakhs of police personnel are deployed every time for about two to three months thereby seriously affecting their normal duties. (4) During elections whether for the Lok Sabha or the Assemblies, the entire administrative set up throughout the country slows down considerably and all other normal functions and activities of the Government, including developmental work, are pushed to the background. These create a lot of hardships and sufferings to the common man. The situation con (6) On account of the de-linking of the General elections to the House of the People from that of the State Legislative Assemblies, there is a duplication of the expenditure incurred by the candidates and political parties which results in the pumping in of considerable resources, thereby indirectly affecting money supply in the economy. Further by such de-linking, the candidates at Parliamentary election need more money and resources to fight the election singlehanded over a wide area without the backing and co-operation of companion candidates of the assembly segments. This also, it is suspected, tends to lead to difficulties for the candidates in keeping within the ceiling for election expenses. (7) The dismantling of the temporary but complicated superstructure raised for the purpose of election by accretion of huge personnel is required to be done as speedily and smoothly as of putting up the super-structure, and normal conditions should be restored quickly. In this respect also, simultaneous elections would be highly desirable.  The ECI report said, “Having regard to the above considerations, the Commission is strongly of the view that a stage has come for evolving a system by convention, if it is not possible or feasible to bring about a legislation, under which the General elections to the House of the People and Legislative Assemblies of the States are held simultaneously. After all, such an arrangement worked immensely satisfactorily, generally speaking, prior to 1967.  National Commission to review the working of the Constitution headed by former Chief Justice of India M. N. Venkatachaliah recommended in the first volume of its report in 2002, “With a view to reducing election costs and strain on human and other resources, State and Parliamentary level elections, to the extent possible be held at the same time.” It is clear that several constitutional bodies have always been in favour of restoring the ‘One Nation, One Election’ principle that was followed till 1967. The imposition of a model code of conduct during polls which are held at different times has a severe impact on the governance as governments aren’t allowed to take important policy decisions. The common people of India have been bearing the burden of elections around the year for too long. "
Reviving the Voices of History: Celebrating the unsung women of India's constituent assembly,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/reviving-the-voices-of-history-celebrating-the-unsung-women-of-indias-constituent-assembly-12824582.html,Politics," September 18, 2024 / 16:02   ","In the introduction to his book Incarnations: A History of India in 50 Lives, Sunil Khilnani writes, “India’s history is a curiously unpeopled place... it has dynasties, epochs, religions, and castes, but not many individuals. Beyond a few iconic names, most of the important historical figures recede into a haze.” The book aims to “dispelling some of the fog by telling India's story through fifty remarkable lives.” India’s constitutional journey started with the enactment of its Constitution in 1950. However, its trajectory was laid four years prior, when in December 1946, 299 members of the Constituent Assembly met for the first time in the Central Hall of the old Parliament House. Those seated in that Central Hall were stalwarts of their fields and the freedom movement. In that male-dominated assembly, 15 women stood tall. Sadly, their contributions did not receive the recognition they deserved. Just about 5 percent of the total membership, their voices could have easily gone unheard. However, they were women of high calibre and mettle. They made their voices heard, and their dissent was registered. But barring the few, stories of more than half of them did not get the due recognition in the pages of history. However, finally, their life stories have been retrieved from the “haze” and historical oblivion in a wonderful new book titled 'The Fifteen: The Lives and Times of the Women in India’s Constituent Assembly' authored by Angellica Aribam and Akash Satyawali. The authors make a pertinent point when they write, “Although the Constituent Assembly was meant to be a microcosm of India, certain sections of the population were not adequately represented. Only fifteen women were members of this distinguished body.” The fact that there were only 15 women members in the assembly (which came down to 13 after the resignations of Leela Roy and Malati Choudhury) speaks volumes about the male-dominated society. Even after 76 years of independence, when India held general elections in 2024, it chose merely 74 female members, which is only 15 percent of its total membership. Thus, the small number of women members in the assembly at that time is not surprising; rather, it is the historical indifference to recording their achievements that is more surprising. The book fills this large gap by providing short biographical accounts of these women leaders. The sketches are short and at times leave the readers wanting for more. Nevertheless, it provides a solid background of their politics, ideology, social context, philosophy and above all their struggles and their contribution to nation-building. The book is full of rich and interesting anecdotes related to the members which spice up the historical retelling of these extraordinary lives. For example, the name of Ammu Swaminathan might not ring a bell to the majority of readers initially. But it becomes familiar when it is revealed that she was the mother of Captain Lakshmi Sahgal, the iconic commander of Rani of Jhansi Regiment of Indian National Army (INA). Ammu’s struggle against caste discrimination and her fight for women's rights especially in the context of property rights is inspiring. At the same time, her “socialite” lifestyle and illustrious family tree that had Mrinalini Sarabhai as the daughter and Vikram Sarabhai as the son-in-law make it extremely fascinating. Similarly, the story of Annie Mascarene, a Latin Christian who had to struggle against the double odds of gender and caste-based discrimination is inspiring. Her struggle was further accentuated because of the financial constraints. However, through her grit and determination, she went on to do a double MA and later fetched a law degree. During the Constituent Assembly debate, she lent a powerful voice on important constitutional issues. The majority of women members came from relatively privileged backgrounds. From royalty to politically and socially influential families, the majority of these women had social conditioning that made them what they were—independent, educated, politically aware and socially assertive. But there were exceptions too and the most noteworthy among them was that of Dakshayini Velayudhan. Velayudhan belonged to the Pulya caste, marked as untouchables or ‘slave caste'. The extent of discrimination and injustice this caste faced can be gauged from the fact (as highlighted by the authors) that Pulya women were not allowed to wear upper clothes and their children were barred from the government school. Coming from such a background and then achieving excellence in education and becoming a prominent voice of the Dalit community and marginalised class, is a story that can inspire anyone. Other women who have been profiled in the book had illustrious careers. Rajkumari Amrit Kaur became India’s first health minister. Sarojini Naidu—a household name, became India’s first woman Governor. Sucheta Kripalani became India’s first woman Chief Minister of the most populous and politically significant state. Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit headed the delegation to the UN General Assembly session of 1946 and later became Ambassador to Russia. They all rose to prominence on their sheer hard work. They all contributed immensely and they have been widely celebrated. However, the life stories of some of the members like Kamla Chaudhuri, Malati Devi Choudhury and Durgabai Deshmukh have remained largely buried in government archives away from the mainstream. The book makes a serious attempt to unearth these stories and pave the way for further research which might result in detailed biographical accounts of these great personalities. As India prepares to celebrate its 75th year as the Republic, the contribution of these 15 women icons needs to be celebrated, and reading this book can be a good starting point.

Ram Nath Kovind panel report on simultaneous polls placed before Cabinet: Report,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/politics/ram-nath-kovind-panel-report-on-simultaneous-polls-placed-before-cabinet-sources-12824464.html,Politics," September 18, 2024 / 14:36   ","The report of the high-level committee on ’one nation, one election’ was placed before the Union Cabinet on Wednesday, sources said. The panel headed by former president Ram Nath Kovind had submitted the report in March ahead of the announcement of Lok Sabha elections. Placing the report before the Cabinet was a part of the law ministry’s 100-day agenda. The high-level committee had recommended simultaneous elections for the Lok Sabha and state Assemblies as the first step followed by synchronised local body polls within 100 days. The panel had also proposed setting up of an ’Implementation Group’ to look into the execution of the recommendations made by the committee. Simultaneous polls will help save resources, spur development and social cohesion, deepen ”foundations of democratic rubric” and help realise the aspirations of ”India, that is Bharat”, the panel had said. The panel also recommended the preparation of a common electoral roll and voter ID cards by the Election Commission of India (ECI) in consultation with state election authorities. At present, the ECI is responsible for the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls, while the local body polls for municipalities and panchayats are managed by state election commissions. The panel recommended as many as 18 constitutional amendments, most of which will not need ratification by state Assemblies. However, these would require certain Constitution amendment Bills that would need to be passed by Parliament. Some proposed changes regarding the single electoral roll and single voter ID card would need ratification by at least half of the states. Separately, the Law Commission is also likely to come up soon with its own report on simultaneous polls, of which Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been a strong votary. Sources said that the Law Commission is likely to recommend holding simultaneous polls for all three tiers of the government — the Lok Sabha, state Assemblies and local bodies like municipalities and panchayats — starting with 2029 and a provision for unity government in cases like hung house.

India must address Bangladesh’s challenges directly amid diplomatic tensions,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/india-must-address-bangladeshs-challenges-directly-amid-diplomatic-tensions-12824206.html,Politics," September 19, 2024 / 15:53   ","Trains between Bangladesh and India have stopped running. There are three pairs of cross-border trains, but none are currently operating. Additionally, New Delhi has indefinitely shut down all Indian visa application centers (IVACs) across Bangladesh, effectively cutting off all people-to-people contact. Dangerous Diplomatic Silence But the biggest giveaway of the dangerous slide in India-Bangladesh relations is the radio silence after Bangladesh’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus sent a formal request for a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the United States on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly. Both leaders are scheduled to travel to New York this week, but Modi is clearly hesitant to meet Yunus, as the latter is likely to raise contentious issues such as the extradition of fugitive ex-premier Sheikh Hasina. There are currently no indications that New Delhi will address Dhaka’s valid request for Yunus’ engagement with Modi. It would be beneficial for India to sit down with Yunus and clear the air to establish at least a functional relationship between the two countries. Need for Comprehensive Engagement I think India should shed its reluctance and meet ‘Bangladesh 2.0’ self-assuredly without any inhibitions to thrash out issues thrown up by the sudden regime change. Let’s start by acknowledging that there are indeed bilateral problems. And the right approach for a resident power is to confront them instead of avoiding discussing difficult issues. We have, no doubt, suffered a setback and we must sensibly accept the profound changes and new ground realities. But we should keep our chin up and talk rather than withdraw into our shell. New Delhi’s inability to confirm a Modi-Yunus tete a tete in the Big Apple is of a piece with our High Commissioner in Dhaka Pranay Verma’s reticence to meet political players across the board in Bangladesh. He did call on Yunus soon after the 84-year-old Nobel Laureate took his turbulent country’s reins in his hands. But Verma has so far shied away from meeting the leadership of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, Jamaat-e-Islami Party, Workers Party and Jatiya Party, not to mention the Awami League which is on the run, and other smaller outfits. Ultimately, elections will be held and all these players, particularly the BNP and Jamaat, will be in the race to form the next government in Bangladesh. So it’s imperative to hold dialogues with each one of them instead of keeping them at arm’s length. No Bangladeshi politician will say “no” to Verma if he sounds them out for a meeting. I fail to understand what’s stopping him from talking to them. He had no problems interacting regularly with Hasina; the dapper diplomat must now diversify and play the field in our national interest. To Verma’s credit, it must be said that while inexplicably abstaining from courting politicians of various hues, he is however interacting proactively with key Advisors in charge of various departments in the interim administration. He recently held sessions with ex-Foreign Secretary Muhammad Touhid Hossain, Foreign Affairs Advisor, retired Lieutenant General Alam Chaudhury, Home Affairs Advisor, Fauzul Kabir Khan, Energy Affairs Advisor, Salehuddin Ahmed, Economic Affairs Advisor and Fisheries Advisor Farida Akhtar. Unresolved Issues But this is simply not enough as Advisors are, after all, birds of passage and are no substitute for hard-core politicians who will inevitably occupy key posts in the elected government sooner than later. New Delhi should therefore start engaging with all the players in the political spectrum without losing any more time. As Chinese, Pakistani and British diplomats have stolen a march on us in this sphere, we have a lot of catching up to do. So, let’s get cracking. At this critical juncture, India must come to terms sportingly with what Bangladeshis want rather than try to impose our code of conduct on the smaller nation. Let Bangladesh run its own affairs and decide what’s good for it. If Bangladeshis want to proclaim Mohammad Ali Jinnah instead of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as the nation’s father, it’s really their business, not ours. If Urdu stages a comeback in Bangladesh, so be it. Gone are the days of micromanaging Bangladesh. We can’t be Big Brother anymore; at best we can be an elder brother! Managing Bilateral Relations If good sense prevails and India agrees to a Modi-Yunus meeting on American soil, Yunus is bound to raise not only the uncomfortable issue of sending Hasina back to Bangladesh to face trial, but also the alleged irregularities in the deal that the Hasina government signed with the Adani Group for supplying electricity. As South Asia’s tallest leader and India’s foremost spokesperson, Modi should address these concerns immediately and put Bangladesh at ease. Because of the vicious disinformation campaign over treatment of Hindus in Bangladesh, there is every likelihood of the Bangladesh cricket team visiting India from September 19 being subjected to hostilities from the crowd in the stadiums. Authorities in India must therefore ensure that there are no Islamophobic chants aimed at the visitors as political agendas would ultimately hurt our national interests.

Arvind Kejriwal: Activist and politician with many a surprise up his sleeve,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/arvind-kejriwal-activist-and-politician-with-many-a-surprise-up-his-sleeve-12823915.html,Politics," September 17, 2024 / 18:47   ","Arvind Kejriwal is a politician who probably likes to catch people unawares. Beset by charges of corruption, the AAP supremo resigned as Delhi chief minister on Tuesday and sought a referendum on his ""politics of honesty"", the second time he has done so in his 11-year political career. Two days after he was released from Tihar Jail in the excise policy graft case, Kejriwal took everyone by complete surprise when he announced on Sunday he would resign as chief minister and return only if people give him a ""certificate of honesty"" in the upcoming Delhi Assembly polls. Ever the politician with an eye on theatrical effect, he also sought early polls in the city. Clever politics or foolish overreach. The jury will be out on whether Kejrwial played his cards wisely or miscalculated the risk till elections, due in February, are held. But the 55-year-old, who tendered his resignation to Lt Governor VK Saxena on Tuesday after picking senior AAP leader Atishi as his successor in the post, is someone who clearly enjoys doing the unexpected. In December 2013, he took oath of office as chief minister for the first time. Just 49 days later, on February 14, 2014, he quit in a blaze of headlines after AAP's alliance partner Congress opposed his pet project ""Janlokpal Bill"". That dramatic resignation was preceded by visuals of him sleeping in his blue Wagon R in the cold Delhi winter as he staged his protest. Kejriwal, who first came into the limelight as part of Anna Hazare's India Against Corruption campaign, worked hard to seal his image as an everyday man holding his values close to his heart. Declaring his latest decision to resign on Sunday, the IIT graduate and one-time RTI activist said he had stepped down first in 2014 because of his ""principles"". ""Kejriwal has a mind of his own and he is always prepared to experiment and try political moves that border the risky territory. Maybe he is on the path of becoming the biggest political maverick in the history of the country's politics,"" a senior party leader told PTI on condition of anonymity after his decision to step down. Kejriwal was not born into politics and chose not to join an established party but form his own from the ground up. The cleverly named Aam Aadmi Party has been led almost singlehandedly by him. His party – projecting itself as a champion of public welfare initiatives to provide free electricity and water supply, health and education among others -- has quickly grown in the fiercely contested political arena of the country. In 2013, when AAP made its maiden foray into electoral politics, the party won 28 of 70 assembly seats. It has now become the third largest national party of the country after the BJP and Congress. In April last year, the Election Commission recognised the AAP as a national party based on its electoral performance in four states — Delhi, Goa, Punjab and Gujarat. In Delhi, the AAP rode the Kejriwal popularity wave to come back to power in Delhi in 2015 and 2020 winning 67 and 62 seats respectively, practically obliterating the opposition BJP and Congress in assembly polls. In March 2022, the party swept Punjab, winning 92 of the 117 assembly seats. However, Kejriwal’s efforts for a larger footprint have not been very successful and he has so far been confined only to Punjab and Delhi. From leading the India Against Corruption movement to becoming chief minister of Delhi thrice in a row, Kejriwal has had a chequered career as a bureaucrat-turned-activist-turned-politician. Ahead of the general elections this year, he joined the INDIA bloc of opposition parties, whose leaders he had earlier slammed over corruption issues. The AAP has three Lok Sabha MPs from Punjab and 10 Rajya Sabha MPs. He was also under the scanner for adopting a ""soft Hindutva"" approach exemplified by his free pilgrimage scheme and chanting of ""Jai Sri Ram"" slogans in the Delhi Assembly. He once demanded that photos of Ganesha and Lakshmi be put on currency notes for the economic prosperity of the country. Hailing from Haryana's Hisar, Kejriwal earned his engineering degree from IIT Kharagpur and became an Indian Revenue Services(IRS) officer. After quitting the income tax officer's job in 2000, he worked in the field of Right to Information (RTI) Act and lived in the slums of Delhi, apparently to understand the problems faced by people living there. In 2011, he joined the anti-corruption movement initiated by Hazare. Emerging from the anti-corruption movement, AAP was founded in the national capital by Kejriwal and his closest associates in 2012. Kejriwal, who was challenged by politicians during his India Against Corruption days to take a plunge into active politics and taste realpolitik, managed to keep issues like health, education, water and electricity supply at the core of his politics and governance. His detractors slammed him for pursuing ""freebies"" politics. The arrest of Kejriwal in a corruption case in March this year and his over five months behind bars is considered a huge taint for the man who held a 14-day fast in 2013 to put pressure on the then Sheila Dikshit government for action over ""inflated"" water and electricity bills. The ‘muffler man' who makes it a point to dress like the “aam aadmi” with oversized shirts found himself in trouble over allegations of misusing government funds to renovate the chief minister’s official residence. According to the chief secretary's report, around Rs 53 crore was spent on renovation of the CM's bungalow. AAP insiders claim that by resigning from the post of chief minister, Kejriwal also intended to leave his official residence dubbed ""Sheesh Mahal"" by BJP leaders who have been relentless in attacking him. Accusing the BJP of mudslinging, Kejriwal used the Ramayana to make his point in his speech on Sunday. ""When Lord Rama returned from his exile after 14 years, Sita Maiyya had to undergo ‘agni pariksha’. Now, I have come back from jail, and I am ready to undergo 'agni pariksha'."" Kejriwal has justified his decision to resign as chief minister saying he earned nothing in his life except ""respect and honesty"" and he joined politics to do something for the country rather than playing ""game of money from power and power from money"". In the run-up to the 2015 Delhi Assembly polls, he constantly apologised for his actions during the 49-day tenure in 2013 and promised not to quit again. Nine years later, that promise has clearly been forgotten. His decision to again quit the chief minister's post hints at the ""adventurous and risk taking nature"" of Kejriwal, said his party leaders.

What historical data suggests about who could win J&K polls,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/politics/what-does-historical-data-say-about-who-could-win-jk-12823851.html,Politics," September 17, 2024 / 18:43   ","Jammu and Kashmir will begin its first phase of a historic assembly election--first since the region lost its special status in 2019. The peopleâ€™s Democratic Party has 21 candidates, National Conference is contesting 18 seats and the BJP is contesting 16 seats while the Congress has nine candidates. The first phase of this high stakes battle kicks off on September 18, an election that will test Mehbooba Muftiâ€™s Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party. The PDP matriarch had won nearly 50 percent of the 19 seats up for grabs in elections held in the valley a decade ago. The first phase also includes her family seats of Anantnag and Bijbehara, where the third generation of the Mufti family, Mehboobaâ€™s daughter Iltaja Mufti, is contesting against an old-time PDP loyalist. Can PDP repeat its performance? A Moneycontrol analysis shows that JKPDP won nearly half the seats in the elections conducted between 2002 and 2014. It had wrested control of the seven districtsâ€”Pulwama, Shopian, Kulgam, Anantnag, Kishtwar, Doda and Rambanâ€”from the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference in 2002. In the 1998 elections, JKNC won 14 of the 19 seats in the seven districts. The contest will also be tough for the Congress and BJP, which held 21 percent of the seats contested in the assembly elections a decade ago.  CongressÂ and BJP While Congressâ€™ tally had reduced to four from seven in 2008, BJP had opened its account in the region for the first time since 1996, winning four seats in 2014. BJP would hope that improved track record over the last decade will likely bring more votes for the party. According to Niti Aayog, multidimensional poverty in the union territory was reduced to 4.8 percent in 2019-21, compared with 12.6 percent in 2015-16. Ramban, which comprises two assembly constituencies, has the highest multidimensional poverty across districts at 14.9 percent. Kishtwar and Doda, comprising six of 24 assembly constituencies, also have a high poverty rate compared with the rest of the districts. Delimitation is also likely to create challenges for contesting parties, as five new constituencies will be electing candidates for the first time.  "

Atishi, who was chosen as Kejriwal’s successor at an AAP legislature party meeting, said, “We have staked claim to form a new government. I will protect the interests of Delhi people.” Elaborating on the developments, Delhi minister Gopal Rai said, “We have informed the LG about his decision. Atishi has presented her claim to form the government. We have requested the LG to decide on a date for the oath-taking ceremony so that the work of two crore people can be carried on.” Chief minister-designate Atishi has alleged that Arvind Kejriwal has been falsely implicated and is being targeted by central probing agencies. ""The Supreme Court not only granted him but also made harsh remarks against the Centre and its probe agencies calling them a caged parrot,"" she added. ""Had it been some other leader, they would have kept the chief minister's chair but Kejriwal decided to go to the people's court. He resigned. This is a sad moment for us,"" Atishi said. The people have vowed to choose Arvind Kejriwal as the chief minister again in the soon-to-be-held Delhi assembly polls, she added. (With PTI inputs) "
AAP asks Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal to quit over controversial remarks on Atishi,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/aap-asks-rajya-sabha-mp-swati-maliwal-to-quit-over-controversial-remarks-on-atishi-12823641.html,Politics," September 17, 2024 / 15:51   ","The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday asked its Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal, who has accused Arvind Kejriwal's aide of assaulting her, to quit the Upper House following her comments about Delhi's chief minister-designate Atishi Marlena. Shortly after AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal announced that the senior minister would take over from him as the chief minister, Maliwal, who has been at loggerheads with the party, took to microblogging site X and described Atishi's appointment as a ""sad day for Delhi"". ""Today is a very sad day for Delhi. Today, a woman whose family fought a long battle to save terrorist Afzal Guru from being hanged is being made the Chief Minister of Delhi. His parents wrote mercy petitions to the Honorable President to save terrorist Afzal Guru. According to him, Afzal Guru was innocent and was framed as part of a political conspiracy,"" she said.pic.twitter.com/SbllONqVP0Swati Maliwal (@SwatiJaiHind) September 17, 2024 Describing CM-designate Atishi as the ""dummy CM"", Maliwal wrote, ""Although Atishi Marlena is just a 'dummy CM', still this issue is related to the security of the country. May God protect Delhi!"" She also shared a mercy petition signed by Atishi’s father, Vijay Singh, and her mother, Tripta Wahi, which was addressed to then-President Pranab Mukherjee. The petition urged the President to stop Guru’s execution and called for a parliamentary inquiry into the case, saying, ""We, therefore, appeal to you (The President) to not only set aside the punishment given to Mohd Afzal but also to facilitate a Parliamentary inquiry into the entire episode"". In an old video, Atishi’s mother is heard criticising Guru's execution, saying, ""We are unhappy that Afzal has been made, in our understanding, a scapegoat"". Maliwal also posted a video message, saying, ""This is an extremely unfortunate day for Delhi. A woman like Atishi is going to become the CM of Delhi, whose own family fought a long battle to save terrorist Afzal Guru from death penalty. Her parents wrote mercy petitions to the President several times, that he was innocent, that he should not be hanged, and that he was a victim of political conspiracy. How wrong is this? Today, Atishi will become the CM but we all know that she will be only a ""dummy CM"". Still, this is a major issue because she will be the CM and this matter is directly linked to the security of the country as well as Delhi. God save the people of Delhi from such a CM"". Atishi had addressed the controversy in 2019. “I am not responsible for any political decisions made by my parents. The responsibility and accountability for those actions lie with them and they are fully capable of expressing their own views. I can speak for myself, and I was not in support of that decision,” she said in an interview to Amar Ujala. Reacting to Maliwal's remarks, party MLA Dilip Pandey demanded her resignation from the Rajya Sabha, accusing her of furthering BJP's interest . ""Swati Maliwal goes to the Rajya Sabha on AAP’s support but follows the BJP’s script. She should seek a Rajya Sabha ticket from the BJP if she has any sense of shame or morality left and should resign immediately,"" he said. The Aam Aadmi Party named Atishi as the chief minister of Delhi, two days after Kejriwal  said he would quit the position. Kejriwal proposed Atishi's name for the top job during a legislative party meeting. A few months ago, Maliwal accused Kejriwal’s aide Bibhav Kumar of assaulting her at the chief minister’s residence, leading to a public spat with the party. Kumar was recently granted bail by the Supreme Court in the case.

There are two types of politics - politics of convenience and politics of conviction. After seeing Emergency in 1975, I have been doing the politics of conviction, so this kind of thought never came to my mind. My party’s decisions are supreme for me,” Gadkari said at the News18 Chaupal event on September 16. The comments come days after Gadkari said a senior politician from the opposition had approached him with an offer to back his candidacy for the prime ministerial post ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. However, Gadkari revealed that he turned down the offer, citing his unwavering commitment to his party and its ideology. Meanwhile, Gadkari said he is hopeful BJP will win upcoming state elections in Maharashtra, and he will make up for lost seats. While commenting on religion being used in politics, Gadkari said politicians who can't win elections based on their work talk about religion. The minister also said he doesn't think there is discrimination against Muslims in Uttar Pradesh.

To honour the Prime Ministerâ€™s birthday every year, the Bharatiya Janata Party celebrates 'Seva Parv', a fortnight-long festival to showcase Modiâ€™s commitment to citizens' welfare and also service to mankind. The party is set to launch 'Seva Pakhwara' or 'Seva Parv' on Tuesday, where workers organize blood donation camps and cleanliness drives across the country â€“ mainly in at hospitals, schools and other public places. While the â€˜Seva Parvâ€™ will still be in focus, two other events will also attract attention this year.Rajasthan's popular Ajmer Sharif Dargah is set to dish out a 4,000-kg vegetarian langar to celebrate PM Modi's birthday, and many businesses in Gujarat's Surat have announced discounts on their offerings ranging from 10 percent to 100 percent on September 17 in hotels, markets, and transport services. Letâ€™s take a look at how Prime Minister Modi has celebrated his birthday over the last few years: 2023: Modi marked his birthday by announcing PM Vishwakarma Yojana, seen as a game changer skilling scheme for peasants, craftsmen and artisans of the country. He also launched two key projects - India International Convention and Expo Centre (IICC) and the extension of Delhi Airport Express line. In his Lok Sabha constituency Varanasi, Modiâ€™s well-wishers engaged in fervent festivities and cut a 73-kg laddoo cake instead of a conventional cake, to symbolise his age, along with 'Akhand Ramayan Path' at the Hanuman temple. 2022: Eight Cheetahs were brought from Africaâ€™s Namibia to Gwalior as part of the Cheetah Reintroduction Project on the PMâ€™s birthday. Having got extinct from the Indian sub-continent, the Cheetahs got a fresh lease of life after PM Modi released the cheetahs at the Kuno National Park (KNP) in Madhya Pradesh and also clicked their pictures. 2021: A special drive was undertaken to speed up India's battle against the Coronavirus, and the country administered a staggering 2.26 crore Covid vaccinations on a single day, to mark PM Modiâ€™s birthday. 2020: Since the country was in the grip of the Covid-19 pandemic, there weren't any celebrations to mark Modiâ€™s birthday. However, the party did organise camps and help desks as part of 'Sewa Saptah', where rations were distributed to the poor and needy while blood donation camps were organised at several places. 2019: The 'Namami Narmada' festival in Gujarat's Kevadiya was celebrated to mark the filling of the dam to its full reservoir level of 138.88 metres. Prime Minister Modi also addressed a large public gathering near the Statue of Unity. The statue was built as an ode to the Iron Man of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the first home minister of independent India.

On being asked how it feels to be a part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Cabinet, the 41-year-old minister said, “What has been more momentous than this feeling has been the past three years’ journey that led me to this place. In the year 2021, fissures appeared within the party, my family also saw separation in the process… I felt like everything that I call my own slipped through my fingers; there was a point where I was left with nothing, was thrown out of my own party, dubbed a nepo kid, and had to build from scratch.” “However, I was resilient through it all and built my party and myself again… everything I have now is the byproduct of these struggles,” he added. When asked if he is scared or if some other party has been triggering his reactions from time to time, Paswan reiterated that the LJP got together to fight the Lok Sabha elections and won all five seats from which it contested. He said, “Darta mein kisi se nahi hu; dar ab nahi lagta hai kisi baat ka (not scared of anyone or anything anymore)."" “When you have lost much and gained so much more thereafter, you lose your fear of losing.” He further said, “Right now, my focus and my party’s focus is entirely on the upcoming Bihar elections”. When asked why he makes statements that make people wonder whether is working for or against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the union minister said, “My relation with my Prime Minister is that of an unbreakable bond that will remain so till my last breath… no power in the world can break it.” He added, “I shared this bond with him when we were not political allies, for instance, during the 2020 elections. Even then I had said, ‘mere dil mein baste hai mere Pradhan Mantri’”. “As for the demands I had raised since Modi 3.0 formed, one must understand that I have a party of my own and we have our own set of ideologies – we have our own concerns and priorities. In the year 2014, when LJP had become a part of the NDA alliance and I made my foray into politics, even then I had clarified that our alliance is based on specific agendas. In fact, any alliance or coalition is always formed on the basis of agendas. If you all of your agendas align, then you might as well be one party,” Paswan said. He added, “Whatever differing points I have raised since Modi 3.0 was formed were on the basis of my party’s agenda and ideologies… Neither my father Ram Vilas Paswan compromised the party’s ideologies, nor will I.” However, he said, he is happy to point out that despite Opposition claims of the Modi govt not paying heed to grievances or opposing viewpoints, PM Modi’s government has so far taken cognizance of every point that was raised by the LJP before taking any decision. Speaking on Aam Aadmi Party’s National Convenor Arvind Kejriwal’s resignation, he said, we have to wait and see if he favours a member of his family and brings them to power after talking against dynasty politics for so long.

In a conversation with CNBC-TV18, Nilesh said that while India's weightage in MSCI indices has been rising, foreign investors are yet to fully catch up, and the latest out-sized Fed rate cut could be a trigger. ""Markets will favour strength, and India has been the strongest bastion for equities"", he added.

Nifty 50 index too high a new high, riding on gains in Dow Jones and S&P 500. The US market strength is supporting the bull run in Asian equities. India's strong growth outlook, relatively benign inflation, and a strong gush of liquidity in equities, all are helping extend the stock market run up, said Nilesh Shah. The move should continue with some routine pauses in between, he added. ""While US growth has been a concern for global economic recovery, this headwind can be a tailwind for India, along with the rush of liquidity,"" Shah added. Fed rate cuts have not greatly moved Indian stock market in the past, but Nilesh believes this time could be 'different'. Nilesh Shah added that Indian midcap IT names are a good space to be in, after the Fed rate cut, for they are expected to grow faster than the largecap names, as a bet on US economy.

Banking Stocks Lead the Charge: The Nifty Bank index rose for the seventh consecutive session and hit a fresh high of 53,357 led by gains in ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, and Kotak Mahindra which were up 1-2 percent. Banking stocks hold the maximum weight in the benchmark indices. After having declined by 1.5 percent in July and 0.4 percent in August, the index has risen over 4 percent so far in September.

Why banking stocks will continue to struggle even if RBI follows Fed's 50 bps rate cut path,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/why-banking-stocks-will-continue-to-struggle-even-if-rbi-follows-feds-50-bps-rate-cut-path-12826104.html,Market," September 20, 2024 / 11:29   ","Rate sensitive stocks tend to rejoice on easing of monetary policy, and with the US Fed announcing a jumbo rate cut of 50 basis points, it is a no brainer that banking stocks may also attract huge investor interest. However, this time, it is different. While hopes for RBI to follow steps of the Fed have increased, market experts expect the underperformance of banking stocks to continue in the near-term on account of a combination of factors including trailing margins, sluggish deposit growth, and widening credit-to-deposit (CDR) ratio. Chokkalingam G, founder of Equinomics Research, cautioned that even if the RBI cuts interest rates, banking stocks are unlikely to see relief in the near term. He highlighted factors such as increased liquidity requirements, higher provisions for credit losses, slow deposit growth, and the widening CDR ratio as ongoing challenges that will keep banking stocks under pressure. So far this year, the Bank Nifty index has risen 9 percent, significantly underperforming benchmark Nifty 50's 16 percent gains. Dnyananda Vaidya, research analyst tracking BFSI sector at Axis Securities concurred to this view, saying that a rate cut by RBI would dent lenders margins in the near-term with higher share of repo-linked loans. Repo-linked loans adjust with changes in the repo rate, potentially narrowing the gap between deposit and loan rates, thereby, squeezing bank margins. However, the Street is split on whether a rate cut by the RBI will happen this year. While some experts anticipate a small rate cut in the October meeting, most are betting on a delayed cut, likely in December or even next year. Which lender will feel the most margin pressure? If the RBI mirrors the Fed's 50 bps rate cut, large private banks like HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, and ICICI Bank are expected to see a margin impact of 15-20 bps, according to Nomura analysts. This is because 50-60 percent of their loan books are directly linked to the repo rate or external benchmarks.  Smaller private banks such as IndusInd Bank, AU Bank, and Bandhan Bank, which have a higher share of fixed-rate loans, will be less affected. Similarly, PSU banks like SBI, which has more MCLR-linked loans, will also experience less impact. Before FY20, banks didn't use repo rates or external benchmarks for floating rate loans; instead, they based lending rates on their internal benchmarks like the MCLR. In October 2019, the RBI mandated that new floating rate loans for retail and MSME sectors be linked to the repo rate or another external benchmark, making lending rates more sensitive to changes in external interest rates.  Despite the margin pressures, the overall impact on banks' return on assets (RoA) is expected to be limited, thanks to potential mark-to-market (MTM) gains from their treasury books, said Nomura. Treasury gains occur when bond prices rise after a rate cut, benefiting banks with large government bond portfolios. Large private lenders like HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, and ICICI Bank are likely to see a 5-10 bps RoA impact, while IndusInd Bank, Bandhan Bank, and AU Bank will experience minimal RoA pressure. Will deposit, CASA ratio improve with a rate cut? Historically, the CASA ratio of the banking system has improved during rate cut cycles. For example, between FY15 and FY17, the CASA ratio rose by around 600 bps, and it improved by 260 bps between FY19 and FY21. However, the RBI's aggressive monetary tightening over the past two years caused the CASA ratio to drop by about 450 bps by March 2024. A future rate cut could help the CASA ratio recover from these low levels, as each 1 percentage point increase in the CASA ratio typically boosts banks' net interest margin (NIM) by 4-5 bps, according to Nomura analysts. Deposit growth could also improve if the RBI shifts to a more accommodative policy. Nomura projects system deposit growth to rise to 13 percent year-on-year for FY25, up from around 11% as of August 9, 2024.

Shaktikanta Das tames volatile Rupee with $689 billion in forex reserves,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/shaktikanta-das-tames-volatile-rupee-with-689-billion-in-forex-reserves-12826091.html,Market," September 20, 2024 / 11:14   ","India’s central bank chief Shaktikanta Das has pulled off a rare balancing act: Clamping down on volatility in the rupee while allowing it to drift lower to aid Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s export ambitions. The Reserve Bank of India’s foreign-exchange reserves have swelled to almost $700 billion in a move reminiscent of China’s accumulation two decades ago. Frequent interventions under Das, whose six years in office are due to end in December, have transformed the rupee from Asia’s most volatile currency to one of the least. At the same time, the exchange rate has dropped to record lows near 84 per dollar without sparking warnings about spiraling import costs and inflation. The latest example: The rupee’s move was comparatively slight when the Federal Reserve’s outsized interest-rate cut this week jolted global markets. Clamping down on volatility and building up a stockpile of foreign exchange holdings to safeguard the economy in the event of skittish overseas investors pulling funds has been a key plank of the RBI governor’s tenure. While the strategy has helped attract foreign investment and improved a current account deficit that often caused headaches for Das’s predecessors, the interventions also bear risks and have been censured by the US Treasury. Das had some structural tailwinds on his side. Nearly $20 billion of debt inflows largely linked to JPMorgan Chase & Co’s inclusion of India in its flagship emerging markets bond index has allowed officials to mop up hard currency, while bullish investors bet big on the world’s fastest growing major economy, helping its stock market overtake Hong Kong to become the world’s fourth largest this year. India’s current account deficit has also narrowed recently thanks to cheaper oil from Russia and global firms setting up service hubs to tap growth in the nation of 1.4 billion people. With the rupee on an even keel, the RBI is now in a position to follow the Fed and lower interest rates as inflation moderates toward its 4% target. While a cut may still happen this year, navigating the easing cycle and maintaining the hard-won currency stability may end up in a successor’s hands. There’s no indication yet who might succeed Das, when an announcement will come, or whether he’ll get another extension. “They’ve been successful in achieving their objectives and in a sense ringfencing India to some of the external shocks,” said Sonal Varma, chief economist, India and Asia ex-Japan at Nomura Holdings Inc. “The strategy of building fx reserves can and should continue.” Das, a former career bureaucrat, has frequently referred to the stockpile as an “umbrella.” The rationale for the rainy day fund is to allow India to avoid a repeat of the 2013 “Taper Tantrum,” when investors bracing for a paring of US stimulus triggered the country’s worst currency crisis in two decades. The RBI did not respond to an email from Bloomberg seeking comment on its exchange rate policy. Due to its forays into the market, India landed on the Trump administration’s watch list for currency manipulators in 2018, and again in 2020. The International Monetary Fund also took the country to task, saying last December that management of the rupee had gone so far as to no longer make it a floating exchange rate. The RBI “strongly disagreed” with that assessment, the Washington-based lender said. Das pushed back while at an IMF-World Bank meeting in Morocco last year, saying the US practice of putting emerging markets countries on a watchlist failed to take into account the challenges they face. “This policy is not without shortcomings – exceptional stability can disincentivise hedging, making the exchange rate susceptible to unexpected external shocks,” said Dhiraj Nim, economist and foreign exchange strategist at ANZ Group Holdings Ltd. “However, at present, it does seem that benefits are outweighing costs.” Those pluses include helping make Indian financial assets attractive to global funds and facilitating the government’s ambition for overseas trade increasingly to be denominated in rupees. Boosting exports — including of items like semiconductors that are crucial to Modi’s dream of having a $500 billion electronics sector by the end of the decade — is another advantage. “The currency has been on a gradual depreciation bias over the past few quarters, to adjust for external imbalances and inflation-adjusted moves of key trading partners,” said Radhika Rao, a senior economist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. Steering a steady course on the exchange rate and forestalling capital flight also has implications for stability of the financial system, another of Das’s policy objectives. Earlier this year, authorities practically shut down a large part of the currency futures market in a bid to crack down on speculators. They’ve also stamped out arbitrage opportunities via offshore markets by intervening in the non-deliverable forwards market in centers like Singapore. “The currency can come under sudden pressure if there is no safeguard,” said R. Gandhi, who served as an RBI deputy governor between 2014 and 2017. “India should continue to accrue more reserves, not only to fight the volatility, but also to improve the import cover to give more strength to the economic fundamentals of the country.”

The downgrade by Investec comes on the back of ""out-of-sync valuation""Â that ignores margin risk. Moreover, the brokerage firm feels that the airline operator exhibits unexcitingÂ earnings growth over the next three yearsÂ and premium valuations. While the large order book offers growth visibility, it does not guarantee earnings growth because of its higher sensitivity to margins,Â added Investec. ALSO READ:Â Neutral InterGlobe Aviation; target of Rs 4970: Motilal Oswal The market share of India's largest airline, IndiGo, grew in August and July after falling 80 basis points in June.

"Will be profitable by 2025, a higher priority than IPO: Tekion CEO Jay Vijayan",https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/will-be-profitable-by-2025-a-higher-priority-than-ipo-tekion-ceo-jay-vijayan-article-12826073.html,Market," September 20, 2024 / 11:20   ","Tekion founder and CEO Jay Vijayan said his cloud-native automotive platform venture will be profitable by 2025. The former Chief Information Officer of Tesla also added that profitability is a higher priority than going public for the eight-year-old company. “We want to get the fundamentals solid and strong. So profitability will be a higher priority than an IPO,” Vijayan told Moneycontrol. An initial public offering (IPO) is one of the milestones but not an end goal, said Vijayan, formerly a close associate of Elon Musk, who left the electric car maker to start Tekion, a firm that reimagines the car buying and selling experience for dealers, auto-makers, and customers. The Pleasanton, US-based firm has so far raised $640 million, with current valuations standing at over $4 billion. Key investors include Index Ventures, Dragoneer, Advent International, Durable Capital Partners, BMW I Ventures, Hyundai, and Airbus Ventures, amongst others. At the end of 2023, the company generated revenue worth over $100 million. Tekion employs close to 3,000 people globally and has plans to hire nearly 300 people globally in the next 10-12 months, out of which 200 will be hired in India.At present, the company has over 3,000 employees about half of them are based in India. The employee base in India are engaged primarily in product, designing, engineering, support centre, etc. Also read: We are Salesforce but 20 years in the future: Tekion CEO Jay Vijayan Path to Profitability The company is taking many steps to become profitable by 2025 such as setting up processes and discipline to ensure repeatable execution. ""So we want to have more repeatable execution and setting (up of) targets and meeting it consistently, even for internal purposes,"" Vijayan said. To do that, the company roped in Jacob Shulman as the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) at the beginning of 2024. Shulman has previously donned the hat of a CFO in two listed companies - JFrog and Mellanox Technologies. Another bet the company has taken is to invest in building the ubiquitous AI. And Generative AI (Gen AI) capabilities are now embedded in every offering of Tekion's sales. “We'll be investing a lot more in AI. It's not something separate we have to go and sell but within the product, we'll keep enhancing,” Vijayan said. Clearing Challenges Tekion’s platform is designed to address key pain points for automotive dealerships and original equipment manufacturers. One of the successes it has had is in the reduction of operational errors and back-end reconciliation issues. ""What happens is, outside of Tekion, they put a small army of people to do all manual. What happens when things are done in manual? Errors. We eliminate errors. No errors at all,"" Vijayan said, explaining how the company leverages its services when transactions are made using Point of Sale (PoS) machines. In the US, traditional car dealerships manage payments for a single repair order involving multiple steps and manual reconciliation. For example, if a repair order includes items covered by warranty, a credit card payment, and cash, different systems handle each transaction. This requires a team to manually reconcile payments, compare statements, and input data into a ledger. Tekion automates this entire process, a major difference from how these transactions are usually done in India. The company has integrated over 52 brands in its Automotive Retail Cloud platform, including some of the top names such as General Motors, Ford, Jeep, Honda, Hyundai, and Toyota, among others. Indian Issues While Tekion’s operations have been successful in the US and Europe, the company is yet to enter the Indian market. The high cost of cloud infrastructure in India has slowed down plans for the company. ""The same cost economics will not work in India. Because just simply, Indian businesses pay one-tenth of what US businesses pay for the same functionality and same software. So, we need to work out on the same economics,"" Vijayan explained on why the company hasn’t entered the Indian market yet. Moreover, price sensitivity in India adds another layer of complexity. Though Tekion does not have immediate plans for expansion into India, Vijayan remains optimistic about the potential. “We’re keeping an eye on the market, but right now, the focus is on strengthening our presence in existing regions,” he said.

"LTIMindtree a key beneficiary of US rate cut cycle, says MOSL",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/ltimindtree-a-key-beneficiary-of-us-rate-cut-cycle-says-mosl-12826075.html,Market," September 20, 2024 / 10:54   ","Motilal Oswal Securities has reiterated its Buy on LTMindtree, with a target price of Rs 7400 per share, as the brokerage bets a recovery in America's BFSI sector will be a key factor driving future growth. The target price implies a 16% potential upside for the stock. MOSL said LTIM may clock a CAGR of 10%/13.7% in USD revenue/INR PAT over FY24-27E. The US BFS sector accounts for 35 percent of LTIMindtree's revenue. After the Fed rate cut, there is anticipation that more ERP modernization projects could take off the ground, which in turn will help LTIMindtree. The MOSL note said it sees US clients resuming â€˜high-priorityâ€™ projects in this vertical. LTIMindtree needs to be watchful of concerns over margin expansion and churn at the top level, MOSL note said. The midcap IT company's strength lies in data engineering, and ERP modernization, and it is well-placed to benefit from the emerging opportunity arising out generative AI investments. ""Initial investments (by US clients) will be centered on data, cloud, and digital infrastructure, and LTIMindtree is well-placed to leverage this emerging opportunity,"" said the MOSL note. During the June quarter earnings call, CEO and MD Debashis Chatterjee said, ""It's too early to call out for the rest of the year. But at least in some verticals, BFS especially, we can see the momentum continuing till end of the year as well for the full year. But it's difficult to call out every industry at this point of time. But at a broad level, the momentum is continuing into Q2 as well."" In Q1FY25, LTIMindtree's BFSI business returned to 2.8% QoQ growth after four consecutive quarters of decline. MOSL said the June quarter saw 'greenshoots' in some client spends, in terms of allocation to high transformation in BFSI, which is LTIM's largest vertical. The company is also seeing good momentum in manufacturing, and MOSL believes this is likely to sustain, as the rate cut cycle will 'further spur investments in technology'. However, there is a note of caution. MOSL said further re-rating of the stock will depend on margin as well as volume recovery, since there are not too many levers apart from the revenue growth. Staffing is another factor that could impact LTIMindtree's execution. ""Headcount addition has been meek in the past four quarters and ramping up hiring could lead to margin pressures."" The merger resulted in top-level exits, leading to a high attrition rate among the senior management, but MOSL added that the worst is behind and the top-level churn is likely tobe 'benign'.

No material change in market outlook post Fed rate cut; all eyes on RBI now: MC Poll,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/no-material-change-in-market-outlook-post-fed-rate-cut-all-eyes-on-rbi-now-mc-poll-12826053.html,Market," September 20, 2024 / 10:28   ","Market experts are of the view that while the 50 basis points rate cut by the US Federal Reserve can be looked as a positive for equity markets globally, including India, it does not significantly change the outlook immediately since it was largely on expected lines. More importantly though, they believe that all eyes are now on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and a rate cut by the central bank would send a strong signal while providing a booster shot in terms of improving investor sentiments and flows -- both domestic and foreign institutional – as well. Moneycontrol reached out to more than a dozen market experts across categories including, research analysts and fund managers. The unanimous view was that the US Fed rate cut was on expected lines – hence the subdued reaction on Thursday – and the focus will now shift to RBI as the Monetary Policy Committee is scheduled to meet next month. Incidentally, a MC Poll of 18 economists on Thursday showed that just three predicted the possibility of a 25 basis points rate cut by RBI in October. “The focus is more on the RBI's reaction, which is expected to be delayed and not immediate. The market will be watching for RBI’s announcements and outlook rather than the Fed's actions,” said Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities. “There is a likelihood of a change in stance from the RBI, and a rate cut may happen in the next meeting. Overall, there is no significant change expected, and the market is waiting to see what the RBI will do next to assess the potential impact,” added Jasani. In a similar context, Emkay Global said that it expects the RBI to follow the US Fed and cut rates either in October or December. “Our view is that the impact of the rate cuts on the broader markets… is likely to be limited. Select sectors may do well, but only if there is a second-order impact on earnings,” it said. This assumes significance as while the US Fed decision was keenly awaited the ‘buy on rumour, sell on news’ approach of the broader market ensured that there was no exuberance visible in the Indian markets on Thursday. The benchmark Sensex gained a mere 236 points on Thursday to close at an all-time high of 83,184.80 while the broader Nifty ended the day at 25,415.80, up 38.25 points. “In terms of market reaction, the immediate response may appear as a ‘knee-jerk’ reaction, common with the 'buy the rumour, sell the news' dynamic. However, on a broader scale, this is a favourable development for emerging markets, including India. Key sectors like financials, pharma, and IT, which are closely tied to global trends, are well-positioned to benefit from renewed demand,” said Krishna Appala, Senior Research Analyst, Capitalmind Research. Similarly, Deepak Ramaraju, Senior Fund Manager, Shriram AMC, is of the view that the markets are expected to remain range-bound but with a positive bias as central banks of broader emerging economies are likely to undertake rate cut decisions. “On the domestic front, RBI will focus on the data and might likely undertake a rate cut in December… The FII flows can be outbound in the short term and as the US dollar starts easing, the flows can come back into India,’ said Ramaraju. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have been buying aggressively buying shares in the Indian stock market in the recent past with the September net buying pegged at nearly $4 billion – a huge jump from previous month’s $873 million. “In terms of FII inflows, while there's a lot of talk about how this could benefit India, it's not guaranteed. Yes, the Fed rate cut is positive for capital flows, but there are other factors to consider -- US elections, earnings, oil prices, and more,” said Trideep Bhattacharya, CIO, Edelweiss Asset Management. “In terms of capital flows, falling interest rates generally boost capital inflows into emerging markets. The second-order impact is that sectors benefiting from rate cuts, as we transition from rising to falling rates, will likely see positive effects. For Indian markets, sectors such as non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), real estate, and IT services are expected to benefit from this environment,” he added. “The (US Fed) rate cut was largely in line with expectations… Our outlook on the equity side remains bullish… As for the RBI, we are watching to see if they will follow suit. The RBI has expressed its intent to follow domestic cues, but given the state of domestic macroeconomics, including persistent inflation concerns, the RBI may not act in perfect alignment with recent events,” said Nirav Karkera, Head of Research at Fisdom. “There could first be a change in stance, with a potential rate cut happening in the next monetary policy announcement. However, we do not expect the RBI to make an immediate move or match the recent rate cut in size,"" added Karkera. On a different note, a section of market experts are also advising investors to remain cautious as valuations currently seem to be in the higher range and not exactly in sync with earnings and fundamentals. “We have been maintaining our view for last couple of months that Fed would be cutting rates soon and that has now come upon. However, the intensity of rate cuts seems steep and could be more political agenda driven for the US. We maintain our cautious optimism view on Indian markets and are focusing on bottom-up stock ideas where valuations and earnings are in sync,” said Aniruddha Sarkar - Chief Investment Officer & Portfolio Manager - Quest Investment Advisors.

"China's Guotai, Haitong securities merger resembles the Swiss model",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/chinas-guotai-haitong-securities-merger-resembles-the-swiss-model-12826056.html,Market," September 20, 2024 / 10:27   ","A shotgun marriage might avert an immediate catastrophe, but is not enough to bury all the conflicts. As regulators in Switzerland are finding out, forcing UBS Group AG to take over embattled Credit Suisse Group AG in 2023 has resulted in resentments that sometimes bubble up in the form of creditor lawsuits, disputes over executive pay, and what constitutes a healthy balance sheet. China is combining Guotai Junan Securities Co and Haitong Securities Co, two of the biggest brokerages and both partly owned by the Shanghai government, in a share swap deal. The new entity will be the largest broker by asset size, topping Citic Securities Co. in areas such as stock trading and margin finance.  While the merger was touted as a big step in Beijing’s yearslong ambition to create an “aircraft carrier-sized” investment bank, the reality may be closer to a scenario in which Haitong needed to be rescued. Not unlike Credit Suisse, Haitong’s overseas arm dabbled in risky margin loans and sold funds that contained illiquid assets. The meltdown of New York-based family office Archegos Capital Management, as well as the collapse of supply chain funds linked to Greensill Capital, were major contributing factors to Credit Suisse’s demise in 2023. In all likelihood, Haitong International, the overseas unit, is edging toward negative equity, if not there already, thereby making a strong case for a bailout now. As of June, the subsidiary reported net assets of only HK$1.4 billion ($180 million), against HK$113 billion in total assets. As a major underwriter for Chinese firms that raised offshore debt in Hong Kong and a trader in those instruments, the subsidiary has incurred huge losses since real estate developers’ bonds started to default in 2021. Despite posting three consecutive years of losses, a sizable chunk of its holdings may not be properly written down yet, strongly suggesting more red ink to come. As of June 2023, Haitong International held HK$31.8 billion in financial assets, with HK$23.1 billion, or over 70% of the total, counted as level 3 fair value measures, which often rely on unobservable inputs to value hard-to-sell assets. Most were in the form of unlisted investment funds. In other words, they were not yet mark-to-market. By comparison, Guotai Junan’s overseas arm is in much better shape, with level 3 financial assets amounting to only 15% of the total.  Haitong International was delisted and taken private by its parent in January. As a result, we do not have more detailed information on the valuation of its financial holdings since June 2023. Haitong Securities and Guotai Junan didn't reply to an emailed request for comments on the merger’s rationale. More than a year after their merger, UBS was still dealing with Credit Suisse’s unsound business associations. It has offered to repay investors 90% on Credit Suisse’s supply chain funds, which had exposure to loans made by Greensill that were marketed as safe investments. Similarly, Guotai Junan will have to figure out what to do with Haitong International’s investment funds. Liquidating Haitong International is not an option, however. It’s a prominent book runner in Hong Kong’s debt capital markets, taking orders for new issues and having established trading lines with most houses. This year, it’s an active underwriter in offshore bond issues by indebted local government financing vehicles in China. In other words, it still serves a purpose, and could possibly therefore make a comeback. There’s a lot of resentment in the aftermath of the Credit Suisse takeover. Senior executives at UBS felt that they were being punished for its smaller rival’s reckless behavior. While China has a long history of keeping the lid on dissatisfaction, make no mistake, discontent is there. After all, just like the arranged marriage in Switzerland, Shanghai-based Guotai Junan and Haitong are practically two sides of the same coin, strong in stock trading and weak in equity underwriting. Their merger has little synergy. The most plausible rationale may be a reluctant bailout. Credit: Bloomberg  "

This capital influx is expected to facilitate IndoStar’s accelerated growth in its primary sectors of vehicle finance and small business loans. Bobby Parikh, chairman of IndoStar, highlighted the strategic importance of this move, emphasising a renewed focus on core business areas. “We are confident that under EQT's stewardship, IndoStar Home Finance will continue to thrive,” he stated. IndoStar has strategically prioritized the expansion of its loan book in the used CV and affordable housing finance segments. It anticipates that a reinforced management team, enhanced processes, and a favorable economic climate will serve as catalysts for growth in these segments, said Motilal Oswal, in note on August 1.

The nascent recovery in the US BFSI was a key consideration, but our decision was also driven by LTIM's superior offerings in data engineering and ERP modernization, along with its strong ecosystem partnerships. These factors position the company well for clientsâ€™ next-gen and pre-GenAI spending. Since the upgrade, the stock has outperformed both the Nifty 50 index and Nifty IT index (LTIM gained 11.0% vs. ~2.5% for Nifty 50 and ~5.0% for Nifty IT). Going forward, we believe that the US BFS recovery will remain a key monitorable, with clients resuming â€˜high-priorityâ€™ projects in this vertical (BFSI accounts for ~35% of the revenue). This, coupled with the resumption of ERP modernization projects, could catapult revenues higher for LTIM. Outlook However, the margin expansion and churn at the top-level management remain key concerns to our thesis. We value LTIM at 35x Sepâ€™26E EPS. We reiterate BUY with a TP of INR7,400, implying a 16% upside potential.

Why banking stocks will continue to struggle even if RBI follows Fed's 50 bps rate cut path,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/why-banking-stocks-will-continue-to-struggle-even-if-rbi-follows-feds-50-bps-rate-cut-path-12826104.html,Stocks," September 20, 2024 / 11:29   ","Rate sensitive stocks tend to rejoice on easing of monetary policy, and with the US Fed announcing a jumbo rate cut of 50 basis points, it is a no brainer that banking stocks may also attract huge investor interest. However, this time, it is different. While hopes for RBI to follow steps of the Fed have increased, market experts expect the underperformance of banking stocks to continue in the near-term on account of a combination of factors including trailing margins, sluggish deposit growth, and widening credit-to-deposit (CDR) ratio. Chokkalingam G, founder of Equinomics Research, cautioned that even if the RBI cuts interest rates, banking stocks are unlikely to see relief in the near term. He highlighted factors such as increased liquidity requirements, higher provisions for credit losses, slow deposit growth, and the widening CDR ratio as ongoing challenges that will keep banking stocks under pressure. So far this year, the Bank Nifty index has risen 9 percent, significantly underperforming benchmark Nifty 50's 16 percent gains. Dnyananda Vaidya, research analyst tracking BFSI sector at Axis Securities concurred to this view, saying that a rate cut by RBI would dent lenders margins in the near-term with higher share of repo-linked loans. Repo-linked loans adjust with changes in the repo rate, potentially narrowing the gap between deposit and loan rates, thereby, squeezing bank margins. However, the Street is split on whether a rate cut by the RBI will happen this year. While some experts anticipate a small rate cut in the October meeting, most are betting on a delayed cut, likely in December or even next year. Which lender will feel the most margin pressure? If the RBI mirrors the Fed's 50 bps rate cut, large private banks like HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, and ICICI Bank are expected to see a margin impact of 15-20 bps, according to Nomura analysts. This is because 50-60 percent of their loan books are directly linked to the repo rate or external benchmarks.  Smaller private banks such as IndusInd Bank, AU Bank, and Bandhan Bank, which have a higher share of fixed-rate loans, will be less affected. Similarly, PSU banks like SBI, which has more MCLR-linked loans, will also experience less impact. Before FY20, banks didn't use repo rates or external benchmarks for floating rate loans; instead, they based lending rates on their internal benchmarks like the MCLR. In October 2019, the RBI mandated that new floating rate loans for retail and MSME sectors be linked to the repo rate or another external benchmark, making lending rates more sensitive to changes in external interest rates.  Despite the margin pressures, the overall impact on banks' return on assets (RoA) is expected to be limited, thanks to potential mark-to-market (MTM) gains from their treasury books, said Nomura. Treasury gains occur when bond prices rise after a rate cut, benefiting banks with large government bond portfolios. Large private lenders like HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, and ICICI Bank are likely to see a 5-10 bps RoA impact, while IndusInd Bank, Bandhan Bank, and AU Bank will experience minimal RoA pressure. Will deposit, CASA ratio improve with a rate cut? Historically, the CASA ratio of the banking system has improved during rate cut cycles. For example, between FY15 and FY17, the CASA ratio rose by around 600 bps, and it improved by 260 bps between FY19 and FY21. However, the RBI's aggressive monetary tightening over the past two years caused the CASA ratio to drop by about 450 bps by March 2024. A future rate cut could help the CASA ratio recover from these low levels, as each 1 percentage point increase in the CASA ratio typically boosts banks' net interest margin (NIM) by 4-5 bps, according to Nomura analysts. Deposit growth could also improve if the RBI shifts to a more accommodative policy. Nomura projects system deposit growth to rise to 13 percent year-on-year for FY25, up from around 11% as of August 9, 2024.

The downgrade by Investec comes on the back of ""out-of-sync valuation""Â that ignores margin risk. Moreover, the brokerage firm feels that the airline operator exhibits unexcitingÂ earnings growth over the next three yearsÂ and premium valuations. While the large order book offers growth visibility, it does not guarantee earnings growth because of its higher sensitivity to margins,Â added Investec.

No material change in market outlook post Fed rate cut; all eyes on RBI now: MC Poll,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/no-material-change-in-market-outlook-post-fed-rate-cut-all-eyes-on-rbi-now-mc-poll-12826053.html,Stocks," September 20, 2024 / 10:28   ","Market experts are of the view that while the 50 basis points rate cut by the US Federal Reserve can be looked as a positive for equity markets globally, including India, it does not significantly change the outlook immediately since it was largely on expected lines. More importantly though, they believe that all eyes are now on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and a rate cut by the central bank would send a strong signal while providing a booster shot in terms of improving investor sentiments and flows -- both domestic and foreign institutional – as well. Moneycontrol reached out to more than a dozen market experts across categories including, research analysts and fund managers. The unanimous view was that the US Fed rate cut was on expected lines – hence the subdued reaction on Thursday – and the focus will now shift to RBI as the Monetary Policy Committee is scheduled to meet next month. Incidentally, a MC Poll of 18 economists on Thursday showed that just three predicted the possibility of a 25 basis points rate cut by RBI in October. “The focus is more on the RBI's reaction, which is expected to be delayed and not immediate. The market will be watching for RBI’s announcements and outlook rather than the Fed's actions,” said Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities. “There is a likelihood of a change in stance from the RBI, and a rate cut may happen in the next meeting. Overall, there is no significant change expected, and the market is waiting to see what the RBI will do next to assess the potential impact,” added Jasani. In a similar context, Emkay Global said that it expects the RBI to follow the US Fed and cut rates either in October or December. “Our view is that the impact of the rate cuts on the broader markets… is likely to be limited. Select sectors may do well, but only if there is a second-order impact on earnings,” it said. This assumes significance as while the US Fed decision was keenly awaited the ‘buy on rumour, sell on news’ approach of the broader market ensured that there was no exuberance visible in the Indian markets on Thursday. The benchmark Sensex gained a mere 236 points on Thursday to close at an all-time high of 83,184.80 while the broader Nifty ended the day at 25,415.80, up 38.25 points. “In terms of market reaction, the immediate response may appear as a ‘knee-jerk’ reaction, common with the 'buy the rumour, sell the news' dynamic. However, on a broader scale, this is a favourable development for emerging markets, including India. Key sectors like financials, pharma, and IT, which are closely tied to global trends, are well-positioned to benefit from renewed demand,” said Krishna Appala, Senior Research Analyst, Capitalmind Research. Similarly, Deepak Ramaraju, Senior Fund Manager, Shriram AMC, is of the view that the markets are expected to remain range-bound but with a positive bias as central banks of broader emerging economies are likely to undertake rate cut decisions. “On the domestic front, RBI will focus on the data and might likely undertake a rate cut in December… The FII flows can be outbound in the short term and as the US dollar starts easing, the flows can come back into India,’ said Ramaraju. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have been buying aggressively buying shares in the Indian stock market in the recent past with the September net buying pegged at nearly $4 billion – a huge jump from previous month’s $873 million. “In terms of FII inflows, while there's a lot of talk about how this could benefit India, it's not guaranteed. Yes, the Fed rate cut is positive for capital flows, but there are other factors to consider -- US elections, earnings, oil prices, and more,” said Trideep Bhattacharya, CIO, Edelweiss Asset Management. “In terms of capital flows, falling interest rates generally boost capital inflows into emerging markets. The second-order impact is that sectors benefiting from rate cuts, as we transition from rising to falling rates, will likely see positive effects. For Indian markets, sectors such as non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), real estate, and IT services are expected to benefit from this environment,” he added. “The (US Fed) rate cut was largely in line with expectations… Our outlook on the equity side remains bullish… As for the RBI, we are watching to see if they will follow suit. The RBI has expressed its intent to follow domestic cues, but given the state of domestic macroeconomics, including persistent inflation concerns, the RBI may not act in perfect alignment with recent events,” said Nirav Karkera, Head of Research at Fisdom. “There could first be a change in stance, with a potential rate cut happening in the next monetary policy announcement. However, we do not expect the RBI to make an immediate move or match the recent rate cut in size,"" added Karkera. On a different note, a section of market experts are also advising investors to remain cautious as valuations currently seem to be in the higher range and not exactly in sync with earnings and fundamentals. “We have been maintaining our view for last couple of months that Fed would be cutting rates soon and that has now come upon. However, the intensity of rate cuts seems steep and could be more political agenda driven for the US. We maintain our cautious optimism view on Indian markets and are focusing on bottom-up stock ideas where valuations and earnings are in sync,” said Aniruddha Sarkar - Chief Investment Officer & Portfolio Manager - Quest Investment Advisors.

"Brokerages weigh impact of US court's patent decision on Zydus Life, Lupin; shares in focus",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/brokerages-weigh-impact-of-us-courts-patent-decision-on-zydus-life-lupin-shares-in-focus-12825953.html,Stocks," September 20, 2024 / 09:06   ","Pharma majors Zydus Life and Lupin shares will be in focus on September 20, after the USÂ Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit stated that theÂ district court whichÂ invalidated the â€˜780 patent covering Mirabegron erred in the decision-making process. Zydus Life and Lupin are the only two players that have launched generic Mirabegron at risk.Â However the maker of the original,Â Astellas Pharma Inc., sued to blockÂ Lupinâ€™s and Zydusâ€™ generic versions, stating it infringes on their patent. A federal judge rejected this request in April 2024. Mirabegron is used in the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency and urinary frequency. The companies are among the first to launch the generic version in 25 mg dosages in the US market and is prepared to launch 50mg dosages imminently. Follow our market blog to catch all the live updates InCred Equities maintained its 'add' rating on Lupin, with a target price of Rs 2,329 per share, while reiterating its 'add' Zydus Life, but cut its target price to Rs 1,330 per share. The brokerage noted that there are various potential outcomes, but despite the ongoing litigation, it does not foresee any immediate risks to the earnings estimates. Currently, InCred Equities projects revenue of $135 million and $35 million from Mirabegron for Zydus, and $70 million and $10 million in FY25 and FY26, respectively. JPMorgan added that while the development adds uncertainity to the litigation outcome, the international broking firm believes it is not likely to impact Lupin's or Zydus' product strategy at the moment. The current development might stall incremental generic entry from other players for six to nine months, until clarity emerges. Also Read |Â Lupin launches Mirabegron extended-release tablets in US after USFDA nod In the worst case scenario, both the players end up paying damages based on a percentage of loss of profits which was incurred by the innovator. For Lupin, the drug accounts for eight percent of its FY25 profits, while it is 12 percent for Zydus Lifesciences. Japanese brokerage Nomura sees two outcomes: the first, the generic is barred from being sold and the second, Zydus and Lupin continue to sell the product. In the first case, the innovator may pursue an injunction against generics on the back of the appeals court decision. If successful, generic will have to stop selling, thus impacting upsides forecasted for FY25/26/27. ""WeÂ think the impact on FY25 earnings will be lower than the total contribution, as the companies have already booked more than 50 percent of the FY25F sales in 1HFY25, in our view,"" said the brokerage. In the event that Lupin and Zydus are allowed to sell the product, Nomura said, ""We think thecompanies have made assessment of infringement, in case the patent is held valid. Wethink the scope for non-infringement is high particularly for the 25mg strength.Â The risk of damages may be limited to the upside earned from the product and may not bematerially higher (triple damages)."" Bank of America also does not believe that the pharma players will stop selling their generic versions, but the uncertainty of events does create a near-term overhang. As a result, BofA slashed its target prices on Lupin to Rs 1,560 from Rs 1,660 and on Zydus Life to Rs 1,145 from Rs 1,310 earlier.
