The VRS scheme is open to employees who have completed five years of service with the company while the voluntary separation scheme (VSS) has been offered to employees with less than five years of service at the airline, they said.



Air India confirmed the developments without sharing the specific details of the twin schemes that the airline rolled out on Wednesday giving the aspirants a one-month window to apply for VRS/VSS.

Vistara is a joint venture between Singapore Airlines and Tata Group.

Asian currencies were rangebound and lacked direction while the dollar index dipped. The dollar is no longer as dominant as it was in the eighties or nineties but it’s no pushover either as countries such as China push their own currency as a replacement Forex traders said a weak American currency and firm trend in the equity markets supported the local currency even as investors remained concerned ahead of the RBI's monetary policy decision to be announced on Friday. As long as the dollar is the competition for domestic transactions, stabilising the peso will not be easy A surging US currency, and weakening counterparts in Asia, aren’t signs that the world is entering a new FX war Union Home Minister Amit Shah added that rupee trade pact will be the priority of them in the days to come. Having traded in a tight range over the past few days, a buoyant dollar finally broke above the 155 yen level for the first time since 1990 in the previous session Forex and money markets were closed on Wednesday on account of 'Ram Navami'. The greenback is strong because the American economy is vigorous. The region does have choices, none of them easy In the last two quarters of this financial year, the rupee-dollar exchange rate stabilised at around Rs 83.0 per dollar it has happened mainly due to narrowing down of deficit on current account resulting from significant increase in exports of goods and services and trend towards de dollarisation Most Asian currencies fell with the Thai baht down 0.3% and leading losses, while the offshore Chinese yuan also weakened 0.1% to 7.26. The Dollar Index (DXY00) surged to its highest level in 4-1/2 months, ending with a gain of 0.48%. This uptick was initially fueled by last Friday's robust US February personal spending report, which boosted confidence in the dollar. Furthermore, Federal Reserve Chair Powell's remarks on Friday, indicating no rush to lower interest rates, provided additional support to the dollar. On Monday, the dollar continued its upward trajectory following the release of the stronger-than-expected March ISM manufacturing index, signaling a hawkish stance on Fed policy. In contrast, the Reserve Bank of India introduced regulations stating that exchange-traded rupee derivative transactions should solely serve hedging purposes. The Reserve Bank of India had previously announced in January that, effective April 5, exchanges would be allowed to offer forex derivative contracts involving the rupee for hedging contracted exposure.

There’s more to this supremacy than mere interest rates The weakening of the Yen, especially to a 34-year low, can have significant impacts on various sectors in India, particularly the automotive industry Inflation has been steadily declining globally. Both the US and euro-zone consumer price measures peaked at just over 9% in mid- to late-2022, with February seeing euro-zone inflation dropping to 2.6%, lower than the 3.1% figure for the US. On the growth outlook, US gross domestic product rose at an annualised 3.2% pace while the euro zone economy stagnated There have been multiple attempts by economists, central bankers and government officials to wean the public off currency and nudge them towards using digital payment platforms but cash tends to bounce back Data on Friday showed a solid U.S. manufacturing sector, with output rebounding by 0.8% last month after a downwardly revised 1.1% decline in the prior month. At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local unit opened at 82.95 and touched the intra-day low of 82.96 and a high of 82.85 against the greenback. The steep currency declines in Africa should force a switch away from imports toward domestic production and exports. But barriers such as high labour costs, expensive power, poor infrastructure and inefficient regulation limit African firms’ competitiveness. The depreciations could end up reducing both imports and domestic consumption and lead to stagflation At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local unit opened at 83.03 and touched the intraday high of 83.00 against the greenback. The dollar had weakened in recent days in line with falling Treasury yields, even after Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday said that a March rate cut was unlikely.

GOLD RATE IN INDIA,"My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now One of the most precious and expensive metals, gold is considered very significant in India and is also one of the prime investment options at the present time. Not just in the form of jewellery. but gold is also valued in forms of art and coins. Despite a continuous hike in gold prices, people in India continue to invest in gold on a regular basis. Gold prices in India keep changing due to multiple factors including global market condition and the strength of the US dollar, thus leaving varying impact from city to city depending on demand and supply in local markets. If you are also planning to invest in gold, consider taking a look at the following details. Before knowing gold rates in India, it is important to know the difference between 24-carat and 22-carat gold. While 24-carat gold is a 100 percent pure form of gold with no trace of any other metal, 22-carat gold has traces of alloyed metals like silver or copper and has 91.67 percent pure gold. There are several factors that affect gold rates in India including fluctuations in the global market to the strength of the USD, import costs, interest rates on banks' fixed deposits, economic stability, seasonal prices, inflation and demand-supply, among others. While high inflation rates increase the demand for gold and vice versa, its price also shoots up as with an increase in demand. Apart from a few global conditions, the international spot price of gold also affects the metal value of gold in India. Just like any other product, demand and supply also affect gold prices. With a rise in demand and supply for gold, its prices have also increased. Even as buying gold has turned out to be a secure form of investment in India, more and more people are engaging themselves in buying gold. With gold rates skyrocketing in recent times, it is important to take note of a few things before investing in precious metals. TODAY Silver Rate Per Gram/Kg Determined by a combination of factors including international market behaviour, demand, supply and inflation, among others, gold prices in India are indicated by the Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd. and the National Commodities and Derivatives Exchange Limited (NCDEX). Factors that potentially affect gold rates in India are fluctuations in the global market, strength of the USD, import costs, interest rates on banks' fixed deposits, economic stability, seasonal prices, inflation and demand-supply. 24-carat gold is considered to be the purest form with 100 percent gold and no traces of any other metal. Auspicious festivals like Dhanteras, Makar Sankranti, Akshaya Tritiya, Dussehra, and Diwali are considered the best time to buy gold in India. It is primarily because jewellers offer a range of discounts on making charges. The purity of gold can be determined by checking the 'Hallmark' sign on the jewellery. Hallmarked jewellery certifies the claimed purity of gold and further engraves the purity level along with the name of the retailer to ensure that customers are not duped. In a bid to bring transparency into jewellery shopping, the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has been designated to implement hallmarking of gold jewellery to ensure that customers buy the purest form of gold. Through this process, the proportionate content of precious metals is determined and recorded through specific marks such as the BIS logo, the purity of the metal and a unique HUID number. To ensure that customers are not duped and sold off with an impure form of gold that has a mix of other alloyed metals, the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has been designated to implement hallmarking of gold jewellery. Beginning with the custom tax that the government imposes for importing gold into the country, it is followed by other taxes levied by sellers including the GST, making charges, and TDS. The fluctuation in the international markets largely impacts the price of gold in India. For example, any rise in the US Fed interest rate will result in money flowing into government securities and the banking system from gold reserves. India is one of the largest gold importers and sees a major impact with fluctuations in gold prices on global markets. Being the safest and profitable form of investment in India, investing in gold will not only come as an asset but is also considered superior to currency. It is one of the few assets that is tangible and creates a perception of safety among investors. Both purchasing and selling gold are very easy in India. Gold investment in India is popular and can be done through various avenues. These include purchasing gold jewelry, coins, bars, or investing in gold ETFs. Gold jewelry serves a dual purpose of adornment and investment, although factors like making charges should be considered. Gold coins and bars can be obtained from authorized dealers or banks in different weights. Alternatively, investors can opt for gold ETFs, which offer liquidity and convenience. The government also issues Sovereign Gold Bonds periodically, providing an alternative investment option. It's important to track gold prices as they are subject to fluctuations influenced by various factors. Proper storage, such as bank lockers or secure vaults, is essential for physical gold investments. Consulting with a financial advisor is recommended to make informed investment decisions based on individual financial goals and risk tolerance. Furthermore, the Gold Monetization Scheme introduced by the government allows individuals to deposit their idle gold with banks and earn interest on it. This scheme aims to put the idle gold held by households to productive use. However, it's important to note that gold investments come with risks. While gold has historically been considered a safe haven asset, its value can also fluctuate based on international market trends, currency exchange rates, and economic factors. Therefore, it's prudent to carefully monitor gold prices and assess the market conditions before making any investment decisions. Seeking guidance from a financial advisor or investment professional can provide valuable insights and help align your gold investment strategy with your overall financial goals.

SILVER RATE IN INDIA,"My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Silver Prices in India: All you need to know about investment, hallmarking and imports Just like gold, silver is also among the most-purchased and preferred investment options in India. Silver is purchased in different forms including silver coins, bars, jewellery, idols, and utensils, among other items. Before investing in silver, it is important to know the current silver rate and further keep track of the market conditions. Apart from the market condition, one must also know about the factors concerning the purity of the silver, the authenticity of the seller, and the standards for determining weight. If you’re planning to invest in silver, here's what you need to know. As per the latest numbers, the silver rate in India stands at Rs 70.9 per gram and Rs 70,900 per kg. The prices are updated every day, at par with industry standards. Like gold prices, silver prices in India are also affected by a number of factors like demand, global market movement, political factors, and government policies. Demand: During festive and wedding seasons, the demand for purchasing precious metals like gold and silver rises significantly, thus leaving a major impact on their prices. Global market: While silver is considered to be a safer option for investors due to its less volatility, the global market movement also affects the price of silver in India. A drop in oil prices and the dollar usually causes a rise in silver prices. For example, if Rupee falls against the Dollar and the international prices are stable, silver is expected to become costlier inIndia. Political factors and government policies: Global political factors and a number of government policies also affect silver prices in India as any kind of change leads to a global impact, thus playing a role in silver prices. Silver rates: On the basis of international market prices, silver rates also change on a regular basis. This is why it is important to keep track of silver prices to buy them at the best rates. Making charges: Just like gold, jewellers may levy making charges on silver jewellery or cutlery. Therefore, it is important to ask directly about the applied making charges to the jewellers. Sellers: People need to research the sellers before purchasing silver to ensure that they buy genuine products with verified purity. This will not only provide them with good quality silver but will also help them to get the best resale value of silver. Certification: While buying silver, it is important to check the certification of the jewellery or the other items. Is investing in silver a bad or good idea?While the cost of silver is far lesser than gold in India, it is still a safe option for investment. Reselling silver jewellery, cutlery, coins, or bars will help get better returns, based on the current market prices. How to Differentiate Between Pure Silver and Sterling Silver?Fine silver is 99.9% pure silver and is soft in comparison to sterling silver. Sterling on the other hand is an alloy that is made mostly of silver and includes a small percentage of copper and zinc to strengthen it. While both of these look almost the same, silver is not very durable due to softness and sterling silver can last a lifetime if properly cared for. On the other hand, sterling silver is more easily tarnished than pure silver, because of the other metals in it. TODAY Gold Rate Per Gram Global market fluctuations and inappropriate or unstable demand and supply ratios can lead to an increase in silver rates, thus impacting silver prices in India. In comparison to silver jewellery, silver coins or bars are significantly heavier and more durable. Thus, buying silver coins or bars can assure a better return and resale value. One can purchase silver bars from banks, certified jewellers, and online agents in India. Customers need to note that banks usually charge higher rates, in comparison to jewellery shops because of the purity checks and assurance that they provide. Hallmarking is essential for ensuring the purity of the silver that you are purchasing. It is used as a seal of purity. Considered a purity indicator, while hallmarking is not yet mandatory for silver, getting it done will help ensure that your purchase meets certain quality standards. The best time to buy silver is during festive or wedding seasons, as jewellers often provide exciting offers and discounts on purchases. VAT and GST are usually charged on both the purchase and sale of silver in India. While there are no such regulations over the limit of owning silver in India, the government does charge certain taxes after a certain purchase limit is crossed. India is among the world’s biggest silver importers. According to a government statement, India imported nearly 245 billion Indian rupees worth of silver in FY 2022. People can opt for a number of ways to invest in silver in India. From purchasing silver jewellery to buying silver coins, and bars, and investing in the Commodity Futures Exchange, there are a lot of options. While silver jewellery is usually purchased for personal use, investments in coins and bars are often by banks and institutions for official purposes. Similarly, professional investors opt for investment in the Commodity Futures Exchange, while keeping an eye on the market.

Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now MC Learn is an initiative by Moneycontrol to help deepen your understanding of financial markets and various asset classes so as to be able to profit from it. A major part of it is devoted to the three key disciplines of the stock market—fundamental investing, technical analysis and futures and options. The stock market can be both inviting and yet intimidating at the   same time. Inviting because of the promise of untold riches it holds. And intimidating because like in any other field, there are rules and concepts an aspiring investor or trader has to master before he or she can hope to succeed. The stock market of today is far more transparent and well-regulated than what it was in the late 80s and early 90s when retail investors first started taking notice of it. But that does not mean that getting rich from stocks has become any easier. If anything, it has become even harder because a lot more data and information is now publicly available than it was in the past. But like human nature, the fundamental character of the stock market has not changed over the years. Fear and greed remain the dominant emotions that throw up opportunities or can bring about ruin. At the same time, the basic skills like good understanding of businesses, the ability to spot trends and the need for patience and discipline, have stood the test of time. So what does it take to be successful in the stock market? Market veterans would say it is a combination of knowledge, experience and of course luck. Experience can come only with time, and lady luck is known to be fickle. But knowledge can be acquired. And that is where Moneycontrol aims to make a difference. Through the following chapters, we will try to answer commonly asked questions as well as explain complex concepts in an easy to understand language, such that by the end of it you should be the master of your investment decisions. More  A look at all the do's and don'ts of investing to help you become a mindful investor. Stocks are categorised into sectors in order to make them easy to compare the businesses or companies that have a similar business model. Timing the market means deciding to buy or sell anticipating a change in trend just before it happens. Experts say trying to time the market is a futile exercise. But is that really the case? In this chapter, we take a look at the pros and cons of timing the market. Understanding the effects of business cycles on the market is essential to identifying a good investment. Inflation is a macroeconomic phenomenon of price increases that directly affects your finances and money. Not only does it limit your ability to spend, it also eats away your returns. Understanding the economic cycle is important for investors. It helps them decide when to invest and when to exit the market, as it directly impacts everything in the investment world such as stocks, bonds, returns and profits. Active investment versus passive investment has been a topic of debate for decades. However, while comparing the two, it is very important to realise that both forms of investing have their pros and cons. In this chapter, we look at the process of buying and selling, the different types of margins that brokers collect from clients, and grievance redress systems. Trading and investing are different approaches, with their respective pros and cons. In this chapter, we will learn about them. It is preferable to open a demat account with a bank or a custodian if you are not a frequent trader All stocks carry risk. Nothing comes with a guarantee. This is the first thing to understand for any investor. Stock markets enable businesses to raise what is called in market parlance as equity capital. At the same time, it provides savers with an alternate avenue to invest their money. Betting on a particular stock vis-à-vis any other means that the investor has a view on why it is likely to do well. Absent this view, any such bet would be akin to gambling, or a coin toss.

Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Cryptocurrencies are digital tokens — not coin or cash — but digital money which allow people to make payments directly to each other through an online system set-up to allow peer-to-peer transactions without needing a bank. Cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries into an online database that describes specific transactions. Cryptocurrency is stored in   a digital wallet. Cryptos came into existence after the 2008 financial market crisis when a need was felt to democratise how currencies are held, exchanged and regulated. That year a person under the anonymous name Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin. Cryptos today also include Ethereum, Tether, Cardano, and Dogecoin, among others. Cryptos are more democratic in nature – you can use them in any part of the world, but as much as you want and use them anywhere. There is a network of people and their computers which maintains a ledger and any transaction must be validated by all those present in that network. The ledger then gets updated to reflect the transaction. This technology is called blockchain. Cryptos also express values in units similar to traditional currency and some people also consider Bitcoin comparable to gold as they are finite in number and supply and need to be mined. Mining is the process by which new cryptos enter circulation and is also a critical component of the maintenance and development of the blockchain ledger. More  Time and again, the RBI has been cautioning investors on crypto currencies, calling it gambling.  This market has been drawing more investors, despite India not having a regulatory framework on crypto. This scenario can’t continue  Several other cryptocurrencies were also trading in the red. The second-most valued digital asset Ethereum was trading at $3,308.98, lower by 3.13 percent, while Tether was flat at $1 Robinhood has expanded in recent years into services including cryptocurrency, retirement products and credit cards. The new requirements aim to crack down on crypto users who may be failing to pay their taxes, and stem from the $1 trillion bipartisan 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. At the time the bill was passed, it was estimated that the new rules could bring in close to $28 billion over a decade. This comes months after nine offshore exchanges in India were blocked for not registering and following local anti-money laundering regulations under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) 2002. CoinDCX aims to get $100 million AUM by 2025 through this product. Citing Sensor Tower data, KuCoin highlighted that it has crossed CoinDCX and CoinSwitch’s app download growth, which saw an increase of 26.3 percent and 15.1 percent respectively, to become the fastest growing. Earlier this year, Mike Novogratz had even predicted that Bitcoin will be ‘larger than gold’ thanks to baby boomers’ trillions. Sato further said there would be a farewell party on May 26 at Flower Kaori in Kotsu no Mori, Narita City, Japan. On Tuesday, Ethereum was poised for its largest two-day surge in almost two years, driven by speculation over the outcome of U.S. spot exchange-traded fund applications for the world's second-largest cryptocurrency. Ether increased by over 8% to nearly $3,780, following a nearly 14% jump on Monday. Bitcoin also saw gains, now just 4% below its March peak of over $73,800. Interest in cryptocurrencies is driven by speculative motives rather than a means of payment for real economic transactions, the RBI bulletin has said Genesis is paying customers back in crypto where possible, but it does not have enough cryptocurrency to give back everything it owes. While Binance’s penalty is yet to be decided, KuCoin which is fully registered has paid out Rs 34.5 lakhs in penalty and is now operational, said FIU-IND director Vivek Aggarwal. In an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol, KuCoin’s CEO Johnny Lyu gets candid about the company’s India ‘glocal’ strategy, challenges of operating an exchange in the country, strategic investment plans, localised payment solutions and more. Bitcoin, which is the largest cryptocurrency by market value, fell 4.04 percent to Rs 51,12,625.33 on April 30, while the second largest digital asset Ethereum slipped 6.25 percent to Rs 2,51,570.37 Going by the trends in all the past Halving events, Bitcoin prices are unlikely shoot up over the next few weeks, experts said. The survey, featuring 8,976 people across the country, found that 45 percent had invested in cryptocurrencies as part of their long-term retirement plans. Financial advisors, however, say investors should limit their investments in cryptocurrencies to the bare minimum and not depend on them for their retirement. Legislation proposed by Congressman Patrick McHenry that would create a regulatory framework for the industry is sorely needed, whatever its final shape The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said a lower court judge should not have relied on a December 2021 user agreement to find that Coinbase did not hold title to, and was not the seller of, 79 tokens that the customers traded. It was the first time since March 24 that the digital asset went below the $65,000-mark. 'It started with a promising opportunity @crankybugatti on Twitter reached out to me regarding a design role in a company related to a web3 communication app called Social Spectra,' Naved Alam, 22, said. Sending the one time wunderkind to jail for 25 years and stripping him of $11 billion should act as powerful deterrent in a business still badly in need of cleaning up The top three exchanges, including WazirX, CoinDCX, and Zebpay, have collectively surpassed trading volumes of over $584 million in March, compared to $189.91 million at the end of February.

He discovered the 'pion' or 'pi meson', a subatomic particle that plays an important function in particle physics. The team has discovered intriguing X-ray characteristics that can potentially provide insights into the nature of black holes, IIT Guwahati said in a statement. This is the first research paper from IIT Madras to be published in the ‘Science’ journal, the institute said in a statement. If obesity really does cause dementia, why have dementia rates been falling in the west in recent decades at the same time as the number of obese people has been increasing? And why have several studies reported evidence of something termed an “obesity paradox”, where being obese appears to be associated with a reduced risk of dementia? An international team of researchers has witnessed this evolutionary marvel unfolding between a species of oceanic algae and a bacterium. Bangalore's water crisis should send alarm bells ringing; more Indian cities could be headed towards water shortages with heat wave predicted in many cities across India. Plus, more environmental news and science updates. This hidden but vast subterranean ocean, within a mineral known as ringwoodite, has far-reaching implications for our understanding of Earth's formation and the origins of its water. April 8 will witness a total solar eclipse. Like fully sighted people, people with partial vision should avoid looking directly at the Sun. Even though we still don’t fully know why lift happens, aerospace engineers work with mathematical equations that recreate the different speeds on the top and bottom of the airfoil. That process is known as circulation. Water scarcity is a pressing issue affecting numerous cities across India, with projections indicating that the situation will only worsen in the coming years. Where does the word eclipse come from? How did the Chinese emperors interpret solar eclipses? What's the Viking tale around solar eclipses and wolves? Prior to April’s total solar eclipse, marvel at these unique tales. The next total solar eclipse is on April 8. In approximately 600 million years, Earth will witness its final total solar eclipse. Temperatures drop, wind patterns change and diurnal animals alter their behaviour in response to the sudden darkness. The research marks a significant leap in understanding the disappearance of tails among early humans and non-tailed apes. El Niño effect on Antarctica: The potential consequences of Thwaites Glacier’s complete meltdown are particularly dire, with projections suggesting it could raise sea levels by more than 60cm. Even though Pluto was called a planet after its discovery, its planetary status has always been under scrutiny after the International Astronomical Union relegated Pluto from the planet club.

GOLD RATE IN INDIA,"My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now One of the most precious and expensive metals, gold is considered very significant in India and is also one of the prime investment options at the present time. Not just in the form of jewellery. but gold is also valued in forms of art and coins. Despite a continuous hike in gold prices, people in India continue to invest in gold on a regular basis. Gold prices in India keep changing due to multiple factors including global market condition and the strength of the US dollar, thus leaving varying impact from city to city depending on demand and supply in local markets. If you are also planning to invest in gold, consider taking a look at the following details. Before knowing gold rates in India, it is important to know the difference between 24-carat and 22-carat gold. While 24-carat gold is a 100 percent pure form of gold with no trace of any other metal, 22-carat gold has traces of alloyed metals like silver or copper and has 91.67 percent pure gold. There are several factors that affect gold rates in India including fluctuations in the global market to the strength of the USD, import costs, interest rates on banks' fixed deposits, economic stability, seasonal prices, inflation and demand-supply, among others. While high inflation rates increase the demand for gold and vice versa, its price also shoots up as with an increase in demand. Apart from a few global conditions, the international spot price of gold also affects the metal value of gold in India. Just like any other product, demand and supply also affect gold prices. With a rise in demand and supply for gold, its prices have also increased. Even as buying gold has turned out to be a secure form of investment in India, more and more people are engaging themselves in buying gold. With gold rates skyrocketing in recent times, it is important to take note of a few things before investing in precious metals. TODAY Silver Rate Per Gram/Kg Determined by a combination of factors including international market behaviour, demand, supply and inflation, among others, gold prices in India are indicated by the Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd. and the National Commodities and Derivatives Exchange Limited (NCDEX). Factors that potentially affect gold rates in India are fluctuations in the global market, strength of the USD, import costs, interest rates on banks' fixed deposits, economic stability, seasonal prices, inflation and demand-supply. 24-carat gold is considered to be the purest form with 100 percent gold and no traces of any other metal. Auspicious festivals like Dhanteras, Makar Sankranti, Akshaya Tritiya, Dussehra, and Diwali are considered the best time to buy gold in India. It is primarily because jewellers offer a range of discounts on making charges. The purity of gold can be determined by checking the 'Hallmark' sign on the jewellery. Hallmarked jewellery certifies the claimed purity of gold and further engraves the purity level along with the name of the retailer to ensure that customers are not duped. In a bid to bring transparency into jewellery shopping, the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has been designated to implement hallmarking of gold jewellery to ensure that customers buy the purest form of gold. Through this process, the proportionate content of precious metals is determined and recorded through specific marks such as the BIS logo, the purity of the metal and a unique HUID number. To ensure that customers are not duped and sold off with an impure form of gold that has a mix of other alloyed metals, the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has been designated to implement hallmarking of gold jewellery. Beginning with the custom tax that the government imposes for importing gold into the country, it is followed by other taxes levied by sellers including the GST, making charges, and TDS. The fluctuation in the international markets largely impacts the price of gold in India. For example, any rise in the US Fed interest rate will result in money flowing into government securities and the banking system from gold reserves. India is one of the largest gold importers and sees a major impact with fluctuations in gold prices on global markets. Being the safest and profitable form of investment in India, investing in gold will not only come as an asset but is also considered superior to currency. It is one of the few assets that is tangible and creates a perception of safety among investors. Both purchasing and selling gold are very easy in India. Gold investment in India is popular and can be done through various avenues. These include purchasing gold jewelry, coins, bars, or investing in gold ETFs. Gold jewelry serves a dual purpose of adornment and investment, although factors like making charges should be considered. Gold coins and bars can be obtained from authorized dealers or banks in different weights. Alternatively, investors can opt for gold ETFs, which offer liquidity and convenience. The government also issues Sovereign Gold Bonds periodically, providing an alternative investment option. It's important to track gold prices as they are subject to fluctuations influenced by various factors. Proper storage, such as bank lockers or secure vaults, is essential for physical gold investments. Consulting with a financial advisor is recommended to make informed investment decisions based on individual financial goals and risk tolerance. Furthermore, the Gold Monetization Scheme introduced by the government allows individuals to deposit their idle gold with banks and earn interest on it. This scheme aims to put the idle gold held by households to productive use. However, it's important to note that gold investments come with risks. While gold has historically been considered a safe haven asset, its value can also fluctuate based on international market trends, currency exchange rates, and economic factors. Therefore, it's prudent to carefully monitor gold prices and assess the market conditions before making any investment decisions. Seeking guidance from a financial advisor or investment professional can provide valuable insights and help align your gold investment strategy with your overall financial goals.

 Air India has rolled out a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) along with a voluntary separation scheme for its non-flying permanent staff ahead of the merger of Vistara with it, according to sources.

The VRS scheme is open to employees who have completed five years of service with the company while the voluntary separation scheme (VSS) has been offered to employees with less than five years of service at the airline, they said.



Air India confirmed the developments without sharing the specific details of the twin schemes that the airline rolled out on Wednesday giving the aspirants a one-month window to apply for VRS/VSS.



This is the third time Air India has come out with a voluntary retirement scheme for its permanent employees since its privatisation two-and-a-half years ago.



Tata Group took over the reins of Air India in January 2022.



Earlier this month, sources in the know had told PTI that the merger is expected to impact around 600 employees from the two airlines.



Tata Group-owned- loss-making full-service carriers -- Air India and Vistara -- together have more than 23,000 employees.



Similar schemes are expected to be announced by Vistara as well soon as after completion of the fitment exercise and assigning of roles some redundancies are bound to creep in, said a source, adding that Air India is trying to accommodate some of the redundant employees with the Air India group or within the Tata Group companies as well.



Vistara is a joint venture between Singapore Airlines and Tata Group.



Once the merger is complete, Singapore Airlines will have a 25.1 per cent stake in Air India.



The fitment exercise -- which involves the evaluation of the roles and responsibilities of staff of both airlines -- in the run-up to the merger has been going on for the past few months.



The exercise takes into account an individual's prior experience, performance and other factors.



As part of consolidating its airline business, Tata Group is also merging Air India Express and AIX Connect (formerly AirAsia India). 
 The net debt to equity ratio declined from 3 times in FY17 to less than one in FY24

Looking To Buy An EV?Everything You Need To Know,"My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Feeling guilty about your contribution to the rising carbon
					footprint? Fancy jumping on the ‘Go-Green’ bandwagon? Well, electric vehicles (EVs) are definitely
					one way to go about it. EVs are no longer just a hope for the future, they are here right now and on
					the cusp of a revolution. As is the case with anything new, the fear of the unknown is real. To
					allay those fears and help you make an informed decision, here is our comprehensive primer on EVs.
					The technology, why it is better, challenges, global picture, and a journey through the history
					books—we have it all covered. It is everything you need to know about EVs. There’s no engine oil to change, in fact no engine to maintain
						at all. Also, fewer moving parts, no belt or chain to be serviced, no transmission fluid to be
						changed, no clogged-up valves or burnt clutch plate and no sweat over emission tests. So, what
						does maintaining an EV entail? Input the values in the boxes with ‘*’ to calculate the running cost
				of an electric car as compared to a traditional car Number should be greater than 0 Localised electric vehicle battery manufacturing may in fact be the only way to realise India’s EV market potential and help the government meet its target of 30% private EV sales by 2030. Currently, both EV batteries and cells are imported and account for about 40-50% of the EV’s total cost. Manufacturing the lithium-ion cells to make the batteries in India would make them cheaper, faster, and allow for large-scale manufacturing! In fact, even Tesla’s Elon Musk recently announced plans to halve battery costs through in-house battery cell engineering! Watch this episode of Drive Report to understand how manufacturing batteries in India will completely change the EV game! The road to electrification has been long and bumpy.Contrary
						to popular belief, the electric car is not a recent invention and predates the internal
						combustion car by nearly 50 years. Here’s a look at the rise, decline and revival of EVs.  First motorised electric carriage is built. While the actual year
									is disputed, a Scotsman named Robert Anderson is credited with creating the first
									crude electric vehicle while another Scotsman named Robert Davidson built a
									prototype electric locomotive in 1837. Capable of towing 6 tons, it had
									non-rechargeable batteries and a severely limited range of 3 km. Rechargeable ones
									wouldn’t be invented until 1859. ‘Electrobat’, first commercial electric car comes out. Top Speed –
									36kph | Range – 40km. It goes on to serve as a cab. US President Theodore Roosevelt
									became the first president to take a ride in the car. Belgian builder Camille Jenatzy builds the first EV to break the
									100kph speed barrier. Ferdinand Porsche builds the first hybrid electric car. Ford Model T arrives and alters the course of history. It is the
									first mass produced internal combustion car. Costs half as much as an EV and is
									resistant to extreme heat and Detroit’s chilly winters. By 1912, costs about $300, a
									fraction of EVs. Fossil fuel powered cars completely outclasses EVs. By the end of WWII, EV makers had either gone bust or converted to
									fossil fuel. Henney Kilowatt is produced. Of the 100 produced, only 47 were
									sold. General Motors comes out with Electrovair II. But its batteries
									could only last 100 recharge cycles. A new pack at the time would cost $1,60,000. A
									Lamborghini 350GT at the time would only cost $5,480. NASA’s Apollo 15 lunar mission required the use of a car/rover on
									the moon. The Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) is produced. It is popularly called the
									‘Moon Buggy’. The 70s fuel prices skyrocket due to an OPEC-imposed oil embargo.
									EVs were once again in focus and the Sebring-Vanguard Citicar and Comuta car became
									popular. The latter became the largest electric car produced in the US; a record
									beaten by Tesla in 2013. Chevrolet comes out with the Electrovette. But after fuel prices
									dipped, eVette’s low range, low speed and outdated battery tech led to its undoing. Chetan Maini’s Reva Electric is set up. GM produces the EV1m the first mass-produced and purpose-designed
									electric vehicle of the modern era. Toyota Prius arrives. Reva-I, also called G-Wiz in European markets is launched. It is
									India’s first production EV and the world’s first, truly affordable EV.s After failing to convince AC Propulsion to put its
									fast-accelerating prototype ‘Tzero’ into production, Martin Eberhard and Elon Musk
									join forces and use the tech under license to form a little-known brand called Tesla
									Motors. Tesla Roadster is launched. It becomes the first lithium-ion
									battery powered production EV and the first EV to cover 320km on a single charge. EV startups like Rivian and Rimac are launched. Rimac goes on to
									produce the Rimac One – the fastest production electric vehicle. Rimac Two hits
									0-100kph in 1.9 secs. Nissan Leaf is launched. Tesla Model S revolutionises the EV market with its mix of space,
									performance and long-distance driving capabilities. BMW i3 is launched. Chevrolet re-enters the EV market with Bolt. Tesla launches Model
									3. Elon Musk debuts the Tesla Cybertruck concept. Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz, Audi and BMW announce plans to go
									all-electric by the end of the decade. Toyota plans to launch EV featuring new technology called
									‘solid-state batteries’ by 2024. Electricity was not readily accessible as it is today. Only few cities in the US had
						access to electricity at the time. Hence, electric cars were not a viable option for many. EVs at the time were mostly used for short distances. As road infrastructure got
						better, the need for long distance drives became a necessity which EVs at the time could not
						meet. After the discovery of Texas crude oil, gasoline prices plummeted making it
						affordable to the average consumer. This led to cheaper operating costs. Henry Ford made car buying cheaper with the introduction of the Ford Model T which
						cost a fraction of what EVs cost at the time. That, along with the invention of the electric
						starter meant gasoline cars were easier to operate. Following the dip in oil price, gasoline cars started getting cheaper. By 1912, the
						price gap between gasoline cars and EV widened. Al electric roadster in 1912 sold for $1750
						while a gasoline car cost just $650. Ford cars were also available in the $500 - $1000 range. 2019 – 2030 Demand growth in the EV industry Copper, nickel and lithium are some of the key metals used
							in EV battery production The demand for EVs is driving the demand for metals, with
							more and more manufacturers joining the EV bandwagon According to Wright’s Law, lithium-ion battery costs fall by 28%
					for every cumulative doubling of units produced. The battery pack is the most expensive component of
					an EV. Thus, the sticker prices of EVs fall as battery costs decline. Some EVs are already cheaper
					to own and operate than comparable gasoline powered cars due to the cost saved from fuel,
					maintenance, and resale value   Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd. All rights reserved. Reproduction of news articles, photos, videos or any other content in whole or in part in any form

Ex-Minister Nagendra being pressurised by ED to spell out names in Valmiki scam: Siddaramaiah,"My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Friday said former minister B Nagendra, who is in ED's custody in connection with the ST Corporation scam, is being pressurised to name some people. Nagendra resigned as Tribal Welfare Minister after the Karnataka Maharshi Valmiki Scheduled Tribe Development Corporation, Accounts Superintendent Chandrasekharan P died by suicide on May 26. The officer said in his suicide note that there was an embezzlement of Rs 187 crore, including the illegal transfer of Rs 88 crore money. Based on a complaint by the Union Bank of India from where the money was illegally transferred to 217 bank accounts in Hyderabad, the CBI launched an investigation and the Enforcement Directorate also joined. ""We have not received any report from the CBI. They have arrested Nagendra. We have the information that he (Nagendra) is being pressured to name so-and-so persons,"" Siddaramaiah said in a press conference. He said the CBI is investigating it on its own. ""The CBI is investigating 'suo motu'. I am underlining this. The ED raided Valmiki Corporation chairperson Basanagouda Daddal and Nagendra's houses. The agency summoned them for inquiry and arrested Nagendra,"" he pointed out. The CM further said the suicide note only names three people Valmiki Corporation Managing Director J G Padmanabha, Accountant Parashuram Durgannanavar and Chief Manager of Union Bank of India's MG Road branch in Bengaluru, Suchismita Rahul. Chandrasekharan's wife Kavitha too named the trio in her complaint. On June 3, Deputy General Manager of the bank, Mahesh J lodged a complaint with the CBI. ""Since Chandrasekharan had mentioned in his suicide note that Nagendra gave oral instruction and also a video conversation surfaced wherein the minister's name was mentioned, he was asked to resign,"" Siddaramaiah explained. Divulging details of the money trail, the Chief Minister said Rs 187.33 crore was transferred to UBI's MG Road Branch from different accounts, including Rs 43 crore in the treasury. ""Out of Rs 187.33 crore, Rs 88.63 crore was transferred to 18 accounts in Hyderabad. Should they sit idly when the money is transferred there? Shouldn't they have any responsibility and raise objections?"" he wondered. Siddaramaiah said the money was then credited to 199 additional accounts. All put together, Valmiki Corporation's money went to 217 accounts. He assured that the entire money would be recovered. ""Rs 85.25 is at different stages of recovery. We still have to get back close to Rs 4 crore. According to me, the entire money will be recovered. Whatever money was looted and distributed, is on the way to recovery,"" he claimed. Asked whether the Finance department did not notice the illegal transfer of money, Siddaramaiah said it goes in the normal course. Noting that the board of the corporation prepares the action plan and not the finance department, the CM said even in the board meeting the transfer of money was not approved because on March 30, 2024, the board passed a fake resolution. ""It was all fake because the Model Code of Conduct for Lok Sabha election was in place. The Election Code of Conduct for the Lok Sabha election came into force on March 16,"" he pointed out. Siddaramaiah said the bank officers have also wondered how the officers conducted the board meeting. He added that this was an organised crime. To a query about BJP's demand for his resignation over the irregularities, Siddaramaiah counter-questioned, Banks come under whose jurisdiction? Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. Shouldn't she resign? To another question whether this is a joint scam by Centre and the state, he dismissed it. The Chief Minister, however, noted that he has never come across a case like this in his life. Responding to BJP's demand for a CBI probe, Siddaramaiah said once upon a time the saffron party leaders used to call it Chor Bachao Institution (CBI). ""You never gave the case to the CBI when you were in power. I trust my police. The CBI has already entered the picture. ED is doing its job. SIT is also investigating it,"" he pointed out.

Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now The ED on Friday said it has attached land in Gurugram, worth over Rs 300 crore, of real estate group M3M as part of a money laundering probe linked to an alleged land fraud case that also involves Congress leader and former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. A provisional order has been issued by the federal probe agency under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The 88.29 acres of land is located in Basharia village of Harsaru tehsil in Haryana's Gurugram district that borders Delhi. The land is valued at Rs 300.11 crore, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) said in a statement. The money laundering case stems from a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) FIR that was filed against Hooda, the leader of opposition in the Haryana assembly; former director of Directorate of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) Trilok Chand Gupta; realty group R S Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (RSIPL) and 14 other coloniser companies. It was alleged that people, including landowners, the state of Haryana and then Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) were cheated by the accused, the ED said. The HUDA has been renamed as the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran. The ED said the accused cheated them by getting notifications issued under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, and subsequently also under its section 6 to acquire lands of the respective landowners. This ""compelled"" them to sell their land to the coloniser companies at a lower price than the prevailing price, the agency said. The accused, according to the agency, ""fraudulently and dishonestly"" obtained Letter of Intents (LOIs) or licenses on the notified land, causing loss to the landowners and the state of Haryana but got wrongful gains for themselves. The ED said RSIPL, a company ""beneficially owned"" by M3M group promoters Basant Bansal and Roop Bansal, ""colluded"" with those mentioned in the FIR and ""unlawfully"" got approved licenses for 10.35 acres of land for establishing a commercial colony by classifying their case as an instance of ""extreme hardship"" and without legal basis. ""Upon securing licenses to establish a commercial colony, the promoters of RSIPL did not develop a commercial colony which was a precondition for obtaining the licenses,"" it claimed. The accused sold the company, its shares and assets, including the said licensed land for a ""staggering"" sum of Rs 726 crore to Lowe Realty Private Limited, an associated entity of the Religare Group, according to the ED. ""This fraudulent activity of obtaining the said licenses illegally has resulted in the generation of proceeds of crime to the tune of Rs 300.15 crore which were subsequently diverted from RSIPL to the promoters of RSIPL into their bank accounts and to the bank accounts of their family members,"" the agency alleged. These funds, the ED said, were subsequently utilised for operational and business expenses of M3M group companies.

"Reliance Industries Q1 earnings: Revenue climbs 11.5%, boosted by telecom, retail, and oil & gas businesses","My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) reported an 11.5 percent increase in revenue to Rs 2.58 lakh crore in the fiscal first quarter from a year ago, bolstered by contributions across segments. Consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) rose 2 percent from a year earlier to Rs 42,748 crore. The company’s net profit (pre minority) for the quarter ended June 30 dropped 4.5 percent to Rs 17,445 crore, primarily due to increased depreciation expenses. RIL's oil and gas business’s EBITDA surged by 30% due to higher production volume. Operating profits for Jio Platforms Ltd and Reliance Retail Ltd rose 11.6% and 10.5%, respectively. “Consolidated EBITDA for the quarter improved from a year ago with strong contribution from Consumer and Upstream businesses offsetting weak O2C operating environment. Reliance’s resilient operating and financial performance in this quarter underscores the strength of its diverse portfolio of businesses,"" said Reliance Industries chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani. The oil-to-chemicals (O2C) segment’s EBITDA declined 14.3 percent from a year earlier to Rs 13,093 crore due to lower transportation fuel cracks and downstream chemical margins. This downturn was partially mitigated by low feedstock costs and robust domestic demand. Sequentially, O2C EBITDA fell 22 percent due to a fall in fuel cracks amid subdued demand and increased supply, although it was cushioned by improved downstream chemical margins. While energy market volatility continued to affect short-term earnings, the underlying business dynamics remained favourable. Factors such as geopolitics, weather conditions, operational outages, and new refining capacities also drove volatility. Jio Platforms Ltd’s EBITDA increased to Rs 14,638 crore. Jio’s subscriber base rose to 489.7 million, with a net addition of 8 million users during the June quarter. The company also reported 130 million 5G users. ""The digital services business registered an impressive financial performance year-on-year, continuing its positive growth momentum. Jio’s True 5G network, covering ~85% of India’s 5G capacity, continues to attract users, while the fixed broadband offerings are witnessing increasing consumer traction both in homes and enterprises,"" Ambani said. EBITDA of the oil and gas business rose to Rs 5,210 crore. The segment’s EBITDA margin stood at 84.3%. A 44 percent boost in gas production from the KG D6 field partly offset the impact of lower price realizations. The average production at KGD6 was reported at 28.7 MMSCMD of gas and approximately 21,640 barrels per day of condensate. EBITDA for RIL’s retail business rose to Rs 5,664 crore, with store area surpassing 80 million sq ft. ""Retail business delivered robust financial results, as compared to last year, well supported by all consumption baskets,"" Ambani added. RIL’s capital expenditure for the quarter stood at Rs 28,785 crore, comfortably covered by a cash profit of Rs 33,757 crore. Net debt as of June 30 decreased to Rs 1.12 lakh crore, down from Rs 1.16 lakh crore as of March 31, 2024. Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

InMobi sets sights on IPO,"My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Mobile-advertising firm InMobi Pte is planning to go public in India in the second half of next year, seeking to capitalize on a booming stock market in the world’s fifth-largest economy. SoftBank Group Corp.-backed InMobi, whose service lets companies place ads on mobile devices, will shift its corporate base to India from Singapore in early 2025 so that it can begin an initial public offering, Chief Executive Officer Naveen Tewari said in an interview. The move marks a homecoming for InMobi, which Tewari founded in Mumbai but incorporated in Singapore in 2007 to broaden its investor base. “The opportunity in India from a global investor lens is significantly more now,” said Tewari, 47. “And then you have retail investors who are clearly leveraging the capital markets, especially to participate in technology stocks.” InMobi, which competes with the likes of Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google for ad sales, became India’s first venture capital-backed unicorn in 2011. A decade later, it aimed to list in its biggest market of the US, seeking a valuation of about $15 billion. But surging coronavirus infections and a tumble across US stock markets brought that plan to a grinding halt. Now, a newfound vigor in Indian equities — spurred by the country’s swift economic growth — has boosted Tewari’s confidence in his home country’s capital markets. While some of India’s tech unicorns have slumped since their IPOs — fintech leader Paytm is down 80% since its 2021 listing — others such as food delivery startup Zomato Ltd. have seen their shares rise. The US S&P 500 Index is dominated by tech stocks, and India is set to “go down that path over the next 10 years,” Tewari said. InMobi is yet to appoint bankers to underwrite its IPO, he said, and didn’t give an estimate for the company’s valuation in a listing. InMobi is eyeing a valuation of about $10 billion, TechCrunch reported Thursday. InMobi didn’t comment on the number. India’s stock market capitalization overtook Hong Kong’s for the first time in January, helped by the South Asian nation’s growth prospects and policy reforms as well as a retreat of global capital from China. India’s Nifty 50 Index has gained 13% so far this year, outperforming the MSCI Asia Pacific gauge’s 8% advance. That’s spurred several Indian tech companies, which had domiciled themselves in more business friendly regions such as Singapore, to return home. Peak XV Partners-backed digital payments provider Pine Labs Pvt recently moved to India from Singapore and is considering raising about $1 billion in an IPO. Its shift echoed a similar step by Walmart Inc.-backed payments firm PhonePe took two years ago. At least four or five tech companies could list in India in the fiscal year through 2026, especially firms that haven’t achieved the scale to attract IPO interest in the US, according to Gaurav Sood, managing director and head of equity capital markets at Avendus Capital. Also read: India Block Trades Led by Global Firms Reach Record $15 Billion Indian startups’ homecoming comes at a time of a subdued IPO market in Singapore and widespread job cuts in the city-state’s tech startup economy. “Persistent layoffs throughout the global tech industry may keep the proportion of information and communications-related job cuts to total retrenchments in Singapore above pre-pandemic levels,” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Catherine Lim and Trini Tan said in a report. InMobi’s sales were little changed at $268 million in the fiscal year through March 2023, according to data aggregator Tracxn Technologies. The company has been profitable for some years, Tewari said. Tewari, an alumnus of Harvard Business School, founded InMobi with fellow engineering and business-school peers. He then co-founded mobile content provider Glance in 2019, and InMobi is that company’s largest shareholder. Glance, which counts Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani among its backers, is in advanced talks to raise as much as $250 million in a funding round led by existing backer Google, Bloomberg News reported previously.

"Nobody expects RBI to be cheerleader, coordination with govt helped fast revival in economy: Guv Das","My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Governor Shaktikanta Das on Friday said the Reserve Bank's relations with the government have been ""smooth"" during his nearly six-year term, and credited the close coordination between the two for the quick revival of the economy after the pandemic. Speaking at an event organised by Financial Express here, the bureaucrat-turned-central banker said nobody has expected him to be a ""cheerleader"" for the government during his term. ""I am saying from my experience. Nobody expects RBI to be a cheerleader. I have had no such experience,"" he said, responding to a specific question about a lament made by one of his predecessors in a recent book. Asked if he is open for a new term at Mint Road, Das said he is very focused on the current assignment and does not think of anything outside that. Das said the RBI is optimistic that its estimate of 7.2 per cent growth for FY25 will be met, and added that with steady growth, the focus of the policy has to be ""clearly and unambiguously"" on inflation. The inflation elephant is taking pauses and grudgingly moving towards the forest or the 4 per cent target in an unidirectional way, he added. He asked the banks to be watchful on the lag between credit and deposit growth and advised that the former should not exceed the latter. The Governor also warned that the financial system can get exposed to ""structural liquidity issues"" due to the lag between the credit and deposit growth. Amid concerns about Mule accounts being used by fraudsters, Das asked banks to strengthen their customer onboarding and transaction monitoring systems to check unscrupulous activities. The RBI is working with banks and law enforcement agencies to check Mule accounts and digital frauds, he added. Das said RBI's actions on the unsecured lending have had the desired impact and growth in the focus segment has moderated, but flagged concerns on the high ceilings on unsecured lending kept by some banks despite having high exposures already.

"Nobody expects RBI to be cheerleader, coordination with govt helped fast revival in economy: Guv Das","My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Governor Shaktikanta Das on Friday said the Reserve Bank's relations with the government have been ""smooth"" during his nearly six-year term, and credited the close coordination between the two for the quick revival of the economy after the pandemic. Speaking at an event organised by Financial Express here, the bureaucrat-turned-central banker said nobody has expected him to be a ""cheerleader"" for the government during his term. ""I am saying from my experience. Nobody expects RBI to be a cheerleader. I have had no such experience,"" he said, responding to a specific question about a lament made by one of his predecessors in a recent book. Asked if he is open for a new term at Mint Road, Das said he is very focused on the current assignment and does not think of anything outside that. Das said the RBI is optimistic that its estimate of 7.2 per cent growth for FY25 will be met, and added that with steady growth, the focus of the policy has to be ""clearly and unambiguously"" on inflation. The inflation elephant is taking pauses and grudgingly moving towards the forest or the 4 per cent target in an unidirectional way, he added. He asked the banks to be watchful on the lag between credit and deposit growth and advised that the former should not exceed the latter. The Governor also warned that the financial system can get exposed to ""structural liquidity issues"" due to the lag between the credit and deposit growth. Amid concerns about Mule accounts being used by fraudsters, Das asked banks to strengthen their customer onboarding and transaction monitoring systems to check unscrupulous activities. The RBI is working with banks and law enforcement agencies to check Mule accounts and digital frauds, he added. Das said RBI's actions on the unsecured lending have had the desired impact and growth in the focus segment has moderated, but flagged concerns on the high ceilings on unsecured lending kept by some banks despite having high exposures already. He advised prudence to such banks and added that they should avoid exuberance. In light of his comments on Friday, which are also preceded by some actions taken by RBI against some errant entities, Das clarified that no one should assume that there is a big problem with the banking system and added that it remains very stable and healthy. The RBI is not looking at any proposal on allowing corporate entities to own or promote banks at present, Das said, adding that the issue of related party transactions is very real and having any control over them is difficult.

CrowdStrike founder and CEO added that the cybersecurity firm identified the issue very quickly and started to fix it after it found that the system update that was sent had a software bug which caused an issue with the Microsoft's operating system. ""We are working with each and every customer to ensure we bring them back online"", he added.

""Many of the customers are rebooting their systems, and it could be some time for some system while they recover"", Kurtz told NBC after a long night of trying to mitigate the issue. ""Software is a complex world, and staying ahead of adversaries is a tall task"", said Kurtz. IT security tools are meant to ensure that they operate in the worst-case scenario. ""To be the root cause of a global IT outage is an unmitigated disaster"", Ajay Unni, CEO of StickmanCyber, a cybersecurity company told Reuters. Shares of CrowdStrike were down close to 20 percent during pre-market trade on Wall Street this Friday. Shares of Microsoft too were under pressure during pre-market trade in US.

Rahul Gandhi behind Ram Vilas Paswan's UPA exit in 2014? Here's what son Chirag Paswan revealed,"My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Union minister Chirag Paswan disclosed that it was due to Congress MP Rahul Gandhi that his father late Ram Vilas Paswan decided to leave the Congress-led UPA in 2014. ""Rahul Gandhi's refusal to meet him (father Ram Vilas) despite months of trying was one of the key reasons why we left the Congress-led UPA and allied with the BJP just before the 2014 elections,"" the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) president told news agency PTI. Recalling the old times, the LJP chief said that he, along with his father, used to meet Sonia Gandhi often to discuss the future of their party in the UPA. The former UPA chairperson suggested that Ram Vilas meet her son. ""My father sought an appointment and waited for more than three months but Rahul Gandhi did not relent,"" said Chirag Paswan, who at that time too was keen to leave the UPA and join the NDA. Ram Vilas Paswan, however, was still keen to remain in the UPA, and wanted to discuss about the party with Rahul Gandhi, the Union Minister of Food Processing Industries said. He added that till 2013, the party was in the UPA and his father was not ready to leave the alliance. ""He wanted to continue in that alliance and it was extremely difficult for me to convince him to change the alliance,"" said the junior Paswan noting that he preferred a tie-up with NDA due to his admiration and respect for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""It was good for me though. Had the meeting taken place, it would have been difficult for me to convince my father to join the BJP-led NDA,"" Chirag said. Chirag revealed that the Gandhi family scion was one of the key reasons why his party, then undivided and known as Lok Janshakti Party, quit the UPA in 2014. ""I think one of the reasons why my father left the UPA was because he could not meet Rahul ji. My father kept trying for a good three-four months to meet Rahul ji and not even a single meeting could take place. I think that was one of the reasons why my father was very upset. Despite being one of the senior leaders and an important ally in the UPA, he was not given time by Rahul Gandhi for a meeting,"" the LJP chief said. The decision of the senior Paswan, a leading grassroots Dalit leader who passed away in 2020, to break ranks with the UPA and tie up with the BJP was one of the headlines of the poll season in 2014 and helped the BJP build momentum and expand its alliance in an election where it rode the Modi wave to win its maiden majority in the Lok Sabha. Asked about his opinion of Rahul Gandhi, the Union minister told PTI that the Congress MP has of late begun taking his responsibility a bit more seriously. ""Rahul Gandhi showed a lot of reluctance in politics initially but has demonstrated signs of taking on more responsibility of late,"" Chirag said. He, however, criticised the LOP's speech in the Lok Sabha for the personal attacks on PM Modi and the Chair.

AAP to contest all 90 assembly seats in Haryana: Sanjay Singh,"My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now The Aam Aadmi Party will contest all 90 seats in the Haryana Assembly elections, senior party leader Sanjay Singh said on Thursday. The Haryana Assembly elections are due later this year. Addressing the media, Singh said the AAP will fight the Haryana Assembly polls strongly. ""The AAP will contest all 90 seats,"" said the Rajya Sabha MP, who was flanked by Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann and senior party leader Sandeep Pathak. Singh targeted the BJP government in Haryana over the issues of unemployment, law and order, and the Agnipath scheme. ""Today, there is an industry of extortion in Haryana. We saw how farmers were crushed during their agitation. Unemployment is also a big problem in Haryana,"" he said. He said the Agnipath scheme is an ""insult to the Army"". The Centre had announced the Agnipath scheme in 2022 which provides for recruiting youths between the age bracket of 17-and-half years and 21 for four years with a provision to retain 25 per cent of them for 15 more years. These recruits are called Agniveers. Chief Minister Mann said during AAP leaders' visits to different parts of Haryana like Rohtak, Sonipat and Jind, people said they wanted ""badlav"" (change) in the state. Haryana has given chances to the Congress, the BJP and regional parties but all of them looted the state, he alleged. Mann said the AAP will contest the assembly polls strongly and ""Badlenge Haryana Ka Haal, Ab Layenge Kejriwal"" will be its slogan.

Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now year-on-year retail loan growth has increased every month so far in FY23 and bankers expect this trend to continue in the coming months as well, boosted by the festival season demand. 
 The consumer sentiment survey of the Reserve Bank of India shows that Indians are still pessimistic when it comes to discretionary spending. 
 Rising inflation, geopolitical situation and looming recession in the US and Europe deter investors. However, early-stage deals would rebound faster and niche and emerging sectors would gain prominence over the next 12-18 months. 
 The world's second-largest economy is slowing down. And that has sent alarm bells ringing around the world. In fact, if Nomura is to be believed, the downcycle has just started. 
 The Reserve Bank of India's net forward position dropped by a massive $18 billion in June as the central bank went short on the dollar in the 1-month segment. 
  
 China sold a massive $94 billion worth of US treasuries in the year to July, data from the US treasury department shows. 
 Faster adoption of external benchmark linked lending rate (EBLR) is expected to aid transmission of policy rates on to lending rates quickly and boost margins for banks. 
 FY23 may be the year when Life Insurance Corporation's market share losing to private life insurers finally slow down. 
 Indian consumers are more optimistic than before about the prospects of employment and income. But inflation is adding a layer of caution when it comes to spending. 
 Household inflation expectations have moderated but only marginally and Indians are still worried that prices of food and services would continue to go up in the coming year. 
 The risk-off sentiment in global markets has resulted in outflows from Indian shores, puncturing valuations of listed firms here. This gives long-term investors an option to buy resilient balance sheets at a bargain. 
 On a cumulative basis, the pickup in rainfall was significant in July but the distribution was uneven. The month of August now holds the key for kharif output 
 Key driver would be a sustained improvement in both quantum and dispersion of rainfall in the crucial month of August 
  
 Money supply growth has decelerated slightly on the back of a slowdown in bank deposit growth. 
 Liquidity surplus is falling faster than anticipated but this fall is also uneven across the banking system, shown by sporadic borrowings at repo auctions and a consistent fall in standing deposit facility subscription. 
  
 The real effective exchange rate captures the competitiveness of the rupee against a basket of currencies. 
 The hunt for deposits would intensify among banks which could push up retail deposit rates further. 
 Economists expect that the festival season during the second half of the year would help in keeping the trend robust. The upshot is that tariffs are likely to see upside pressure. 
 A recession may seem imminent in the US but signs of contraction are yet to show up on the balance sheets of banks there. 
 Crude oil prices have come off sharply from record highs which is likely to have a favourable effect on inflation. 
 Six months since the central bank vowed to reduce the liquidity glut, the surplus is reducing slowly. 
 India’s imports from Russia outstrip exports and the trade deficit with the country has increased over the past two years. As of March, the trade deficit has more than doubled.

Smart recovery in banking sector credit growth has instilled confidence of a sustained and robust loan offtake in FY23.

The share of retail loans in incremental loans disbursed has fallen in the past few months. This is more a fallout of a bounce back in corporate loans than a slowdown in retail.

Overall sentiment towards spending remains cautious as more than a third of Indians are still wary of their prospects. The ongoing festival season may be far better than during the pandemic but it still is far from sanguine.

Indian startups stare at two years of funding winter even as investors sit on a $9 billion dry powder,"My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now India-dedicated private equity and venture capital (PE/VC) firms are sitting on billions of dollars of dry powder but a full-blown funding revival in the world’s third-largest startup ecosystem is unlikely in the next 12-18 months as investors tread cautiously in an increasingly challenging macro environment. PE/VC firms, focused on India, have raised almost $9 billion in 12 months between September 2021 and August 2022 compared to $5 billion in the year-ago period, data collated by Venture Intelligence showed. However, while these investors made more bets in the 2021-22 period, the cheque sizes seem to have shrunk. During 2021-22, PE/VC firms made 1,470 bets worth $58 billion compared to 1,154 bets of $56.5 billion in the year-ago period. Ashish Kumar, Managing Partner at Nandan Nilekani’s Fundamentum Partnership, said that as VCs do not have any specific time frame to deploy the funds that they have raised, they might wait for the macros to turn positive before aggressively investing in companies. “Capital will start getting deployed, but at a slower pace. I don’t think dealmaking will happen at a pace of 2020 or 2021,” said Kumar. The slower pace of investments, coupled with the huge sums of money that the PE/VC firms have raised, indicates that investors are in a wait-and-watch mode. A full-fledged rebound will take at least another 12-18 months and, unlike in 2021, they will invest in smaller amounts in fewer companies due to macroeconomic concerns such as rising inflation, shrinking liquidity and global supply chain disruptions. However, investors say early-stage deals would rebound faster and niche and emerging sectors would gain prominence over the next 12-18 months. “Next year is unlikely to be a year of rebound. We need to prepare for at least two years of funding winter with varying degrees of intensity. A recession looks likely in the US and Europe. The growth forecast is not robust unlike the global financial crisis when China held up growth,” said an industry source requesting anonymity. “It is true that India is decoupled to a certain extent but if developed markets are sinking, we will be impacted. There are also geopolitical factors at play- from what Putin will do to the rumours swirling around China and Taiwan. Deals are happening because the market is here, but it will not be a return of 2021, will happen at a slow and steady pace. If you look back at the dot com bust of 2000, it took nearly 18 months to bottom out. We will go through a phase of orderly descent,” the source added. Pushing back on investment decisions Industry observers believe that PE/VCs would delay investment decisions and their due diligence will take longer than last year as they would be more careful about choosing companies in an uncertain macroeconomic environment. “There’s no finite period for VCs to deploy capital. In extraordinary circumstances, VCs can always write to their LPs saying that we might need some more time to deploy the fund. So my sense is the pace of deployment in 2023 would be slightly better and I am bullish on 2024, but all this will depend on how macros shape up,” Kumar of Fundamentum said. Echoing Kumar, Vikram Gupta, founder and Managing Partner of IvyCap Ventures, said he expects investors to go slow on investments and come back only to a few select companies amid the uncertain macroeconomic environment. “I have seen Series B/C rounds happening at Series A valuations or in some cases even at discounts to Series A. This has pushed back the overall deal flow and so you see fewer deals happening as only startups with dire need of money are raising funds. The ones that have some sort of runway are waiting,” Gupta told Moneycontrol. “That doesn’t mean just because the capital is getting piled up, all of a sudden investors will have to write cheques and somehow deploy capital. There’s always certain pressure to deploy capital in a certain time frame, but investors would rather delay their investment decisions than just somehow deploy capital,” Gupta added. Kumar and Gupta also expect early-stage investments to rebound at a faster pace compared to growth and late-stage investments. Both the VCs have raised their largest-ever funds worth $227 million and $214 million respectively and added that they are already witnessing faster deal activity at early stages, especially with larger investors like Tiger Global, which usually invest at later stages, also becoming active at early stages. Early-stage deals set to rebound faster Kumar and Gupta have a point. Early-stage deals have already started gathering momentum. Between August 2021 and September this year, investors have made 828 early-stage deals (up to Series A) worth $3.19 billion compared to 631 deals worth $2.02 billion between August 2020 and September 2021. The average size of early-stage deals also rose to $3.85 million during the period from $3.20 million in 2020-21. “At the early stage, we are already starting to see enough activity and many Seed to Series A start-ups are getting funded as we speak,” said Swati Murarka, Vice President at Athera Venture Partners. “The growth and late stage deals, however, are still slow with performances catching up with valuations. This could take up to a year or more,” Murarka added. Murarka’s comments on valuations come at a time when fundraising conversations have stalled over valuations, especially for growth-stage and later-stage startups. For instance, a LightSpeed-backed edtech company that was looking to raise about $10 million in its Series A round struggled to get the valuation it was seeking. The company was looking at raising the money at over $100 million valuation but Matrix Partners, which had committed to lead the round, told the company to match its revenue projections before agreeing to invest at that valuation. The company has now promised to show better revenue to Matrix by the year-end to get its desired valuation. Questions sent to Lightspeed did not elicit any response. Matrix Partners denied the development entirely. “On the Seed and early-stage side, there’s reasonable activity, but on the growth-stage side, there has been a little bit of slowdown,” Anand Daniel, Partner at Accel said. “People want to watch more to understand how the metrics are shaping up for startups. So people are taking a little bit more time to make those investment decisions. We still see good companies getting funded on the growth but it's a slowdown,” Daniel added. Niche sectors to gain prominence Along with early-stage investments, investors also see niche and emerging sectors attracting investments. Sectors like space tech, green technology and drone tech, which are at nascent stages in India, already have fundraising activity jumping, industry experts said. According to data collated by Venture Intelligence, in the first nine months of 2022, Space Tech startups have raised $107 million in funding across six deals versus $32 million in seven deals in the whole of 2021. Since May this year, dealmaking in the sector has further gained pace as three companies have raised $69 million versus $26 million raised by four companies in the same period last year, data by Venture Intelligence showed. ESG startups, meanwhile, have raised $843 million across 46 deals in the first nine months of 2022 against $458 million in 42 deals in the whole of 2021. The average deal size has also gone up to $18 million in the first six months of 2022 from $10.9 million in 2021. Drone tech startups, too, have seen more deal activity this year. In the first nine months of 2022, drone tech startups have raised $76 million across eight deals against $22 million across six deals in the whole of 2021. Industry insiders say that new and emerging sectors could get more attention from investors going forward as these companies might be able to raise funds at higher revenue multiples compared to established sectors like edtech, fintech and e-commerce. “In established business models, like e-commerce companies that we have already seen in plenty, for up rounds to happen, investors would definitely ask for increased visibility on profitability. There will be a reset, I don’t see the kind of madness that happened in 2021 in companies like that,” Kumar said. “Even in 2021, if you look at past data, let’s say e-commerce companies like Shopclues etc, the multiples at which they were raising money seven-eight years back, even in 2021 they weren’t able to touch that multiple. So there’s always a reset that happens. But looking at the VC and startup ecosystem, every 12-18 months there will be new kinds of business models, new kinds of technology, and wherever there’s exuberance you will see them getting richly valued,” Kumar added.

In Charts | China's growth slowdown explained,"My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Earlier this week, on August 15, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) sent ripples through global financial markets after it cut interest rates by 10 basis points. The Chinese central bank's decision to do so comes even as central banks around the world are tightening monetary policy to fight high inflation. While this would hurt growth, central banks believe it is more important to bring down inflation – which is over 40-year highs in some cases – as it is detrimental to growth in the medium- to long-term. China, however, is currently not battling high inflation; at least, not the sort other large countries are witnessing.  While Producer Price Index (PPI) inflation has cooled down from the double-digit territory it was in late 2021, consumer inflation in July rose to 2.7 percent – the joint-highest since April 2020. As such, the PBoC is not in a position to ignore inflation altogether. The growth situation, then, has to be rather dire for the PBoC to cut rates even as inflation concerns remain. And it is.  Last month's data showed China's GDP expanded a mere 0.4 percent year on year (YoY) in April-June – the slowest since the economy contracted by 6.9 percent in the first quarter of 2020 when it was confronted with the worst of the Coronavirus pandemic. More recently, the PBoC's August 15 rate cut came immediately after data showed China's industrial growth came in below expectations at 3.8 percent in July, with growth in retail sales also missing forecasts. The Chinese central bank is not the only one to have taken notice of the weak economic data. On August 18, Nomura cut its GDP growth forecast for China for 2022 by 50 basis points to 2.8 percent and by 40 basis points to 5.1 percent for 2023. ""China's post-Omicron rebound has fizzled out and the prospects for near-term growth are poor,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, said in a note on August 18. ""Virus outbreaks are happening with increasing frequency. The housing market remains in a downward spiral. And exports look set to drop back before long. To make matters worse, credit growth has so far been unresponsive to policy easing. More support is on its way but it will probably be too late, too little to prevent output from stagnating this year,"" Evans-Pritchard added. China's zero-COVID policy has forced several parts of the country to shut down. As per some estimates, nearly two dozen cities – accounting for almost 10 percent of the GDP – are in the midst of some form of a lockdown. Just how restrictive are China's lockdowns? According to the University of Oxford's Government Response Tracker, the stringency index for China, as on August 15, was 73.61.  The stringency index measures how strict a country's policies on people's movement are. It measures this on a scale of 1 to 100, in increasing order of stringency. While China measured in at 73.61 in mid-August, irrespective of the vaccination status of a person, the US was at 32.63 as on August 2, India at 37.04 as on August 16, and Germany at 14.81 on August 8. To put this in perspective, the last time restrictions on people's movement were so stringent in India was at the peak of the Omicron variant-led third wave in early 2022. Also making matters worse for the Chinese economy is the unravelling of the housing market, with July being the 11th consecutive month in which home prices fell on a month-on-month basis.  The debt-laden Chinese real-estate sector has been a problem for some time now. However, citizens have now taken matters into their own hands by refusing to repay home loans for houses yet to be completed. According to the South China Morning Post, the 'mortgage boycott movement' is now active in 320 real-estate projects across 100 cities. Such has been the ferocity of the movement that, late last month, the Politburo announced that local governments must ensure delivery of housing projects. Further, as per a July 27 Financial Times report, the PBoC plans to issue low-interest loans of 200 billion yuan, to begin with, to enable state-owned banks to help the flailing realty sector, and therefore, the economy. That importance of a rapidly-growing China for the Asian and global economies cannot be overstated. In the July update to its World Economic Outlook report, the International Monetary Fund had downgraded its global growth forecast for 2022 by 40 basis points to 3.2 percent, with the slowdown in China being one of the key reasons. According to Nomura, ""the downcycle is just starting"". ""China's credit impulse leads Asia's export cycle. It is pointing to continued slowdown, negative growth next year, and a trough only around mid-2023,"" Nomura economists said in a note on August 17. ""...going forward, the weakness is likely to spread as final demand slows across the advanced economies. The downcycle is just starting.""

Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Earlier this week, on August 15, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) sent ripples through global financial markets after it cut interest rates by 10 basis points. The Chinese central bank's decision to do so comes even as central banks around the world are tightening monetary policy to fight high inflation. While this would hurt growth, central banks believe it is more important to bring down inflation – which is over 40-year highs in some cases – as it is detrimental to growth in the medium- to long-term. China, however, is currently not battling high inflation; at least, not the sort other large countries are witnessing.  While Producer Price Index (PPI) inflation has cooled down from the double-digit territory it was in late 2021, consumer inflation in July rose to 2.7 percent – the joint-highest since April 2020.

 The consumer sentiment survey of the Reserve Bank of India shows that Indians are still pessimistic when it comes to discretionary spending. 
 Rising inflation, geopolitical situation and looming recession in the US and Europe deter investors. However, early-stage deals would rebound faster and niche and emerging sectors would gain prominence over the next 12-18 months. 
 The world's second-largest economy is slowing down. And that has sent alarm bells ringing around the world. In fact, if Nomura is to be believed, the downcycle has just started.

 Air India has rolled out a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) along with a voluntary separation scheme for its non-flying permanent staff ahead of the merger of Vistara with it, according to sources.

The VRS scheme is open to employees who have completed five years of service with the company while the voluntary separation scheme (VSS) has been offered to employees with less than five years of service at the airline, they said.



Air India confirmed the developments without sharing the specific details of the twin schemes that the airline rolled out on Wednesday giving the aspirants a one-month window to apply for VRS/VSS.



This is the third time Air India has come out with a voluntary retirement scheme for its permanent employees since its privatisation two-and-a-half years ago.



Tata Group took over the reins of Air India in January 2022.



Earlier this month, sources in the know had told PTI that the merger is expected to impact around 600 employees from the two airlines.



Tata Group-owned- loss-making full-service carriers -- Air India and Vistara -- together have more than 23,000 employees.



Similar schemes are expected to be announced by Vistara as well soon as after completion of the fitment exercise and assigning of roles some redundancies are bound to creep in, said a source, adding that Air India is trying to accommodate some of the redundant employees with the Air India group or within the Tata Group companies as well.



Vistara is a joint venture between Singapore Airlines and Tata Group.



Once the merger is complete, Singapore Airlines will have a 25.1 per cent stake in Air India.



The fitment exercise -- which involves the evaluation of the roles and responsibilities of staff of both airlines -- in the run-up to the merger has been going on for the past few months.



The exercise takes into account an individual's prior experience, performance and other factors.



As part of consolidating its airline business, Tata Group is also merging Air India Express and AIX Connect (formerly AirAsia India). 
 The net debt to equity ratio declined from 3 times in FY17 to less than one in FY24 
 In his message to shareholders in the annual report, Singh said the company will continue to focus on corporate governance, operational excellence and upholding the value of the company's founders.

The company’s net profit (pre minority) for the quarter ended June 30 dropped 4.5 percent to Rs 17,445 crore, primarily due to increased depreciation expenses. RIL's oil and gas business’s EBITDA surged by 30% due to higher production volume.

The oil-to-chemicals (O2C) segment’s EBITDA declined 14.3 percent from a year earlier to Rs 13,093 crore due to lower transportation fuel cracks and downstream chemical margins. This downturn was partially mitigated by low feedstock costs and robust domestic demand. Sequentially, O2C EBITDA fell 22 percent due to a fall in fuel cracks amid subdued demand and increased supply, although it was cushioned by improved downstream chemical margins.

Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now India's largest cement manufacturer UltraTech Cement said during their post-earnings investor call that it expects cement volumes to grow by ""double digits"" for the ongoing financial year, even as the same for the industry is seen at seven-eight percent for the period. The company's Chief Financial Officer, Atul Daga, said during the call that demand for the ongoing quarter is expected to be subdued owing to the monsoons. For the ongoing quarter, demand across the cement industry may grow by 3-3.5 percent year-on-year, Daga said. During the April-June quarter, the Aditya Birla group company reported grey cement volumes in India of 30.29 million tonnes, representing a nine percent sequential decline, although it grew six percent year-on-year. April-June is generally considered to be strong sales months for the industry. While the General Elections and the preceding Model Code of Conduct, which stretched for all but the last few weeks of the quarter, were dampeners in term of demand, extreme heat and unavailability of labour owing to it also worked against cement manufacturers for the reporting period. In FY24, UltraTech Cement beat the industry in terms of volume growth, reporting a volume growth of 13 percent on-year to 112.23 million tonnes, while the overall sector's sales volumes grew in the range of 7-8 percent. Cement manufacturers are considering FY25 to be a ""six-month year"" or even less, as the monsoon will be followed by the festive season in most parts of India, as well as assembly elections in key states like Maharashtra, Haryana, and Jharkhand. For Apr-Jun, UltraTech reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,695 crore, flat on-year, and lower than the Rs 2,259 crore for Jan-Mar. Consolidated net sales were reported at Rs 18,069 crore. While it was slightly higher than that of the same period last year, it declined on a sequential basis, from Rs 20,419 crore in Jan-Mar. While revenues were higher than Street estimates, net profit was lower. UltraTech's shares closed 3.2% lower on the National Stock Exchange at Rs 11,272.50.

Margins improved by 100 bps QoQ to 21.1% ahead of our & street expectations of 20.6%, majorly attributed to 4Q one offs reversal and gains from Project Maximus, which got offset by increase in variable pay & FX. The deal win at US$4.1 bn was soft vs last quarter, however the pipeline remains healthy on the large deals. The strong rebound in Q1 and in-tech integration in Q2 has led to revise the guidance upward to 3-4% in CC (vs 1-3% CC organic earlier).The revenue growth was encouraging in Q1 with a sharp recovery in Fin Services (FS), pre-dominantly driven by a couple of sub-verticals. Other verticals also contributed to the healthy growth in Q1, however the quantum of growth looks dwarf against the growth within FS.

Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now KR Choksey's research report on Bajaj Auto For Q1FY25, BJAUT’s total volumes continued a strong growth trajectory at +7.3% YoY/ +3.1% QoQ. Revenue for Q1FY25 grew by 14.9% YoY (+2.7% QoQ), which was in line with our estimates. EBITDA at INR 23,704 Mn grew by 22.7% YoY (+3.8% QoQ), which was in line with our estimates. The EBITDA margin of 19.7% grew by 113 bps YoY (+10 bps QoQ), driven by better realization and cost reduction, which more than offset the drag from the growing e2W business. Reported PAT stood at INR 19,418 Mn, up +18.1% YoY due to the cascading effects of operating performance but declined by 3.5% QoQ. The reported PAT was 3.8% lower than our estimate primarily due to higher-than-expected tax rates. Outlook We increase our FY25E/FY26E estimates on expectations that the EBITDA margins can inch up due to newly launched products and PLI benefits.

Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now KR Choksey's research report on Bajaj Auto For Q1FY25, BJAUT’s total volumes continued a strong growth trajectory at +7.3% YoY/ +3.1% QoQ. Revenue for Q1FY25 grew by 14.9% YoY (+2.7% QoQ), which was in line with our estimates. EBITDA at INR 23,704 Mn grew by 22.7% YoY (+3.8% QoQ), which was in line with our estimates. The EBITDA margin of 19.7% grew by 113 bps YoY (+10 bps QoQ), driven by better realization and cost reduction, which more than offset the drag from the growing e2W business. Reported PAT stood at INR 19,418 Mn, up +18.1% YoY due to the cascading effects of operating performance but declined by 3.5% QoQ. The reported PAT was 3.8% lower than our estimate primarily due to higher-than-expected tax rates. Outlook We increase our FY25E/FY26E estimates on expectations that the EBITDA margins can inch up due to newly launched products and PLI benefits. Due to the continued strong performance and multiple growth levers in place, we assign a P/E multiple of 29.1x (Previously: 27.8x) on FY26E EPS of INR 376.2 to arrive at a target price of INR 10,948/share (Previously: 10,263).

Suzuki Motor to reduce hatchback Alto's weight by 15 percent over next decade,"My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Maruti Suzuki has revealed Suzuki Motor Japan's 10-year technology strategy, as part of which it will aim to reduce the weight of hatchback Alto by 100 kg from the current 680 kg, which will be 15 percent lower. The strategy aims to reduce energy usage by the car over the next decade. Maruti Suzuki shared a statement by Suzuki Motor that said it will focus on energy efficiency and recyclability of batteries, aiming for a carbon-neutral footprint. In Suzuki's assessment, a 200 kg reduction in vehicle weight can cut down on energy consumption by 20 percent at the manufacturing stage and 6 percent when in use. The new strategy by Suzuki will employ “technology that minimizes energyconsumption” from manufacturing to recycling, Suzuki Motor Corp said in the statement. Smaller motors and batteries would hopefully allow Suzuki to lower car prices, the company said. Its high-efficiency engine - the Z12E - will be extended worldwide to minimize energy consumption, the company added.

Suzuki Motor to reduce hatchback Alto's weight by 15 percent over next decade,"My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Maruti Suzuki has revealed Suzuki Motor Japan's 10-year technology strategy, as part of which it will aim to reduce the weight of hatchback Alto by 100 kg from the current 680 kg, which will be 15 percent lower. The strategy aims to reduce energy usage by the car over the next decade. Maruti Suzuki shared a statement by Suzuki Motor that said it will focus on energy efficiency and recyclability of batteries, aiming for a carbon-neutral footprint. In Suzuki's assessment, a 200 kg reduction in vehicle weight can cut down on energy consumption by 20 percent at the manufacturing stage and 6 percent when in use. The new strategy by Suzuki will employ “technology that minimizes energyconsumption” from manufacturing to recycling, Suzuki Motor Corp said in the statement. Smaller motors and batteries would hopefully allow Suzuki to lower car prices, the company said. Its high-efficiency engine - the Z12E - will be extended worldwide to minimize energy consumption, the company added. Suzuki Motor also said that it is working on software and driver-assist technologies such as Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), that will help reduce traffic congestion, particularly in key markets like India. In future, Suzuki said it will design products that can be easily disassembled with recycling and re-use in mind.

"CLSA's Laurence Balanco says Nifty uptrend still intact, largecaps making a comeback","My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now CLSA's technical analyst Laurence Balanco believes the chart of Nifty 50 is showing that the market uptrend is intact, even though there may be some sectoral rotation of money at play. ""We are not seeing major signs of weakness (on Nifty 50) and in the month of July, largecaps are making a comeback compared to the midcaps"", Balanco said in a conversation with CNBC-TV18, adding that the index has not made fresh lows compared to June, though there has been some hesitation in the midcap rally. Balanco maintains a longer term price target of 37,700 on Nifty 50, with a level of around 21,700 appearing as a strong floor for the index. The past few weeks have seen all asset classes move higher in tandem, including equities, gold and bitcoin with gold seeing a breakout recently that has prompted CLSA to raise its price target to $2625/oz. ""Gold, S&P equal weight index, and Asia-Pacific banking index has broken out on the upside', Balanco added. CLSA noted that HDFC Bank has seen a pullback in July which Balanco said seems disappointing, but the stock is still above itds 50-DMA and 200-DMA, and one needs to watch out here. IT services in India have seen money rotation however there has not been any leadership in the IT space, Balanco added. Within telecom, RIL remains a preferred pick for CLSA with a Rs 3500-3600 price target. On Brent Crude, CLSA's chartist said there are no signs of any directional breakout from the range and the current band may hold till the year end. Oil prices have stayed higher so far in 2024, supported by supply cuts from OPEC+ offsetting higher production from non-OPEC nations. Signs of poor demand from China, which is a major importer, have pulled back prices from higher levels seen earlier in July. Cryptocurrencies have been on an uptrend and it is expected that the move may continue here, with prices of Bitcoin testing levels above $65,000 this week. The emergence of Republican nominee Donald Trump is the race for the White House too has added to the sentiment, as Trump has held pro-crypto views in the past. In a recent post, billionaire investor Mark Cuban posted on X that Trump as president ""makes it easier to operate a crypto business because of the inevitable, and required, changes at the SEC (US Securities and Exchange Commission)."" ""It's a bitcoin play,"" Cuban wrote. The Japanese yen has risen by about 4% since last week, after Japan is believed to have initiated a surprise bout of currency buying on July 11. A prominent Japanese minister has called for BoJ to raise interest rates which may prop up the value of Yen. As a result, USD-JPY trade saw a break below the 50-DMA for the first time in 2024, and Balanco says we can expect further volatility here. In his interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, Donald Trump has pointed out the weakness of Yen and Yuan, prompting a view that he may back the move to weaken US Dollar if he wins election in November.

Based on extensive analysis of the scope of India’s electronics sector and challenges ahead, NITI Aayog's comprehensive report is titled 'Electronics: Powering India’s Participation in Global Value Chains'. Global Value Chains (GVCs) It is the fragmentation of production across the world, which can lead to more jobs getting created and step up on growth. A finished product today often is an end-product of manufacturing and assembly in multiple countries, with each step adding value. Through GVCs, manufacturers can integrate the know-how of the stages of production from multiple offshore locations. This international integration of the know-how is the key feature of GVCs. Why are GVCs Important?A smart phone that gets assembled in one country might contain design elements from the US, silicon chips from Taiwan or South Korea, and rare earth metals from Africa. The final assembly ensures all countries involved in the process get to retain some value from the export of the finishes good. The World Bank regards GVCs as a powerful driver of productivity, job creation, and better living standards. The right steps can help India maximize its participation in GVCs, hence the NITI Aayog note assumes significance and will act as an indicator for the companies involved in the business. At present, India’s electronics manufacturing revolves around final assembly of electronic goods, with a very nascent ecosystem for design and component manufacturing. Brands and design companies have, however, started to outsource assembly, testing, and packaging jobs to Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS) companies in India. Some of the major listed electronics manufacturers in India include Bajaj Electricals, Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), TVS Electronics and Havells India. As per an OECD report from 2022, about 70 percent of the international trade involves global value chains (GVCs) with raw materials, parts and components crossing borders a number of times. A 2023 WTO report on GVCs noted an increase in GVC-related trade in 2021 and 2022 along with considerable growth in exports. It also noted a shortening of GVCs during periods of trade tensions between China and USA, and because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Blue Star bets on air conditioner sales to double in four years as disposable income grows,"My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Blue Star, a leading player in India's air conditioning business, is betting for the sales to double in next four years from around Rs 27,500 crore at present as the disposable income in the hands of the middle class grows. The company also said in its annual report that it will double the production of ACs at the Sri City plant in the Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh by the end of this fiscal from the current 3 lakh units. Blue Star's outlook for the Gulf region (GCC countries) remains positive, the company said, and is helping it diversify. ""Despite challenges in Qatar and Malaysia due to construction restrictions and weak macroeconomic conditions respectively, Blue Star remains optimistic, fuelled by a positive economic outlook in the GCC region and its commitment to product diversification and market expansion"", the annual report said. It offers turnkey solutions in MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing, and Fire-fighting) projects in the region. The excessive heatwave that has gripped various geographies this year is another factor that the company said is amplifying its future business outlook. ""Given the changing weather pattern, resulting in hotter summers coupled with new and resilient product portfolio in residential and commercial air-conditioning and refrigeration, the Company is optimistic about its future business outlook."" Blue Star has projected a target of 25 percent rise in air conditioner sales during this season, as hotter-than-usual summer is expected to drive strong demand during the season. The air conditioning major reported a strong FY24 riding on robust demand and new launches. It expanded its distribution network, ramped up R&D spend and raised funds through a Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) last fiscal. In a conversation with Moneycontrol, Blue Star Managing Director B Thiagrajan had said in May this year that it does not intend to sacrifice margins to grow its market share. The growth outlook for this year too appears robust with the company betting on growing faster than the market in FY25 and looking to improvement margin. Blue Star now aims to boost its market share to 15 percent by FY25. Shares of Blue Star are higher by 77 percent so far this year and up 112 percent compared to last year.

According to the report, the German company has been discussing the possibility of making an offer for Whirlpool, which has a market capitalisation of around $4.8 billion.

Buy TTK Prestige; target of Rs 902: Geojit Financial Services,"My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Geojit Financial Services research report on TTK Prestige TTK Prestige Ltd. (TTK), the flagship company of the TTK group, mainly focuses on the kitchen appliances segment. The company operates five manufacturing plants and has strong distribution networks. We revised our target price to Rs. 902 (earlier Rs. 950) and maintain Buy rating considering the positive demand outlook. Revenue grew by 2% YoY in Q4FY24 (-8% YoY in exports & 3%YoY in domestic). Exports were impacted due to inflationary pressure. Gross margin improved by a 100bps, aided by reduction in input prices, however, operating margin declined by 70bps YoY to 12.4% due to higher other expenses. The recently acquired modular kitchen business (Ultrafresh) has recorded a sale of Rs. 31cr in FY24 (Rs. 23cr YoY) and has a total of 147 studios now vs 142 YoY. Decreasing inflation will improve discretionary spending, while strong growth in real estate and the GOI’s push for affordable housing are expected to improve demand for kitchen appliances, positive for TTK. Expect Revenue/EBITDA/PAT to grow at 9%/17%/17% CAGR over FY24-FY26E. We value TTK at 41x FY26E EPS. Outlook Barring short-term strains on demand and margins, the long-term outlook remains positive given lowering inflation, improvements in the real estate sector and a strong GoI focus on housing. This, along with TTK’s strong brand recall, augurs well for the company. The stock currently trades at ~38x 1Yr Fwd P/E. We value TTK at 41x FY26E EPS (5Yr avg=42x) to arrive at a revised target of Rs. 902, maintain BUY rating.

Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now ICICI Securities's research report on TTK Prestige Highlights: (1) TTK reported revenue decline of 3.6% in FY24 primarily due to weak consumer demand. However, there was revival in H2FY24 with 3.6% revenue growth YoY. We believe it indicates higher growth in FY25. Favourable base of FY24 will also aid in FY25. (2) TTKPT has likely defended its market share across product categories despite higher- competitive pressures over past three years. (3) Strong momentum in alternative channels has partly offset weakness in general trade. (4) Client additions in exports segment may aid in delivering higher growth in FY25 YoY. (5) Gross margin has largely remained intact despite higher sales promotion expenses. We remain structurally positive on TTK Prestige led by its high RoCE, FCF generation, established brand, distribution and strong promoter background. Outlook We model TTKPT to report revenue and PAT CAGRs of 9.9% and 17.6%, respectively, over FY24-26E. We also model FCF generation to remain strong. We envisage a revival in performance H2FY25 onwards led by favourable base and improving maturity of Judge brand.

Under the deal, Lupin can get a potential total consideration of up to $84 million based on future contingent milestones, the company said. Fabrice Egros, president, global corporate development, Lupin said, “We are very pleased to divest our US commercial women’s health specialty business, including SOLOSEC, to Evofem. This divestment is another step in aligning our US specialty business with our strategic plan to build our specialty business in therapeutic areas where we have building blocks of synergy. These include respiratory and neurological diseases.” Shares of the global pharma major closed 1.69 percent higher at Rs 1,828.05 on NSE. Lupin’s US commercial women’s health specialty business is primarily focused on commercialising SOLOSEC (secnidazole) 2g oral granules, which is an FDA-approved single-dose antimicrobial agent that provides a complete course of therapy for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and trichomoniasis, two common sexual health infections, according to the filing. “The acquisition of this commercial business aligns with and advances our mission to improve access to innovative and differentiated options that impact women’s daily lives. SOLOSEC is a commercially attractive, single-dose oral antibiotic that addresses two pervasive sexual health infections. We can now fully leverage our commercial infrastructure, maximize our strong physician relationships, and re-launch an asset with tremendous growth potential,” said Saundra Pelletier, chief executive officer, Evofem.

Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now By Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi Once again, it was a historic week, ending July 12, for the domestic markets as the benchmark indices achieved new milestones. The Nifty 50 spot index reached a high near the 24,600 mark and closed above 24,500, marking a gain of approximately 0.73 percent from the previous week. Meanwhile, the BSE Sensex surpassed the 80,000 level and closed above 80,500. This surge in the markets was primarily driven by IT stocks, as we have highlighted in recent weeks. The Nifty index confirmed another breakout above the 24,400 level, indicating potential movement towards the 25,000 mark. However, it is important to note the strong index management at play. Previously, Reliance Industries was the driving force behind the rally, and this time, it was the IT sector. In the broader markets, the PSU space remains active and vibrant. On the data front, the foreign institutional investors (FIIs) long-short ratio in index futures reached 84 percent during the week and is now hovering around 80 percent. This trend might not be favourable for the markets in the coming weeks. It appears that the markets are determined to maintain their upward trajectory until the budget announcement in 2024. Consequently, traders are advised to focus on specific stocks and adhere to strict stop-loss strategies in their long trading positions. On the downside, only a breach of the 24,200 level might interrupt the ongoing momentum. The Nifty Bank index exhibited a sideways to negative trend throughout the week, concluding with a decline of approximately 0.72 percent. On the weekly chart, we observed the formation of several reversal candlestick patterns, signaling potential shifts in market sentiment. Looking ahead, a close below the 51,700 level could escalate the selling pressure on banking stocks, potentially dragging the index down to the 51,000 and subsequently the 50,000 levels. Conversely, if the index manages to close above the 52,800 level, we may see a resumption of upward momentum. These critical levels will be key in determining the future direction of the Nifty Bank index. Here are three buy calls for short term: MRPL | CMP: Rs 240  In recent weeks, Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals (MRPL) has been consolidating within a price range of Rs 210-230. However, the stock has recently exhibited a decisive breakout, accompanied by substantial trading volume, indicating a potentially attractive buying opportunity at this juncture. From a technical analysis perspective, the daily MACD has formed a bullish crossover just above the zero line, further signaling a positive outlook for the stock. Based on these indicators, it is advisable to consider adding long positions within the Rs 235-245 range. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 270 Stop-Loss: Rs 225 Hikal | CMP: Rs 360.45  Between March 2023 and June 2024, Hikal has been consolidating within the approximate range of Rs 260-320. Recently, the stock broke out of this range with significant trading volume, making it an attractive buy opportunity. Despite a rally of nearly 40 rupees post-breakout, it is recommended to purchase on any dips. From a technical standpoint, the daily MACD (moving average convergence divergence) has formed a bullish crossover just above the zero line, indicating a positive trend. Therefore, it is advisable to buy within the Rs 335-350 range, aiming for an upside target of Rs 425. To mitigate risk, a stop-loss should be set at Rs 315 on a daily closing basis. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 425 Stop-Loss: Rs 315 Birlasoft | CMP: Rs 732.35  Recently, Birlasoft has successfully surpassed its critical resistance level of Rs 720 and is now holding steady around the Rs 730 mark. This breakout, characterized by substantial trading volume, is a promising indicator of the stock's potential upward movement. From a technical analysis standpoint, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) has rebounded from the 50 level, suggesting renewed strength and making the current price levels especially appealing for investors. Based on these factors, it is advisable to consider purchasing shares within the Rs 720-735 range, targeting an upside potential of Rs 780. To manage risk prudently, a stop-loss should be implemented near the Rs 699 level on a daily closing basis.

Momentum indicators and oscillators like the MFI and RSI are sloping upwards and placed above 60 on the daily and weekly charts, suggesting strength in the current bullish trend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 75, Rs 78 Stop-Loss: Rs 64 Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst at Angel One Triveni Engineering and Industries | CMP: Rs 426  During early June, Triveni Engineering surged notably from Rs 300 to Rs 400. However, following this spike, prices entered a consolidation phase attributed to overbought conditions. After consolidating for a month, prices resumed their upward trajectory, breaking above the upper range of consolidation, which also aligned with the October 2023 high. Volume analysis reveals significant activity during upward movements, contrasting with lower volumes during declines, suggesting accumulation in this stock. Furthermore, prices are comfortably above important moving averages, with any declines finding support around the 20-day EMA, highlighting a strong uptrend. Hence, we recommend buying Triveni Engineering around Rs 426 - Rs 422. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 475 Stop-Loss: Rs 401 Dalmia Bharat | CMP: Rs 1,933.60  Dalmia Bharat has established a solid foundation around the 200 SMA (Simple Moving Average) on the weekly chart, displaying robust signs of a positive reversal. On the daily chart, prices have confirmed a breakout from a Cup and Handle pattern, supported by substantial trading volumes and bullish candlestick formations. Moreover, prices have surpassed the key 89 EMA, which previously posed significant resistance. Additionally, the momentum indicator RSI is comfortably trading in the positive zone, reinforcing a bullish outlook. Hence, we recommend buying Dalmia Bharat around Rs 1,934 - Rs 1,924. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,078 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,848 | Inox Wind | CMP: Rs 171.75  Inox Wind has maintained a robust uptrend, forming higher highs and higher lows, although it consolidated within a range over the past couple of months. Recently, on the daily chart, prices have broken out of this consolidation, resuming their upward movement. They have achieved their highest closing level ever and entered uncharted territory. Additionally, a bullish signal has emerged as the 20-day EMA has crossed above the 50-day EMA. Hence, we recommend buying Inox Wind around Rs 172 - Rs 170. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 200 Stop-Loss: Rs 157 Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities ITC | CMP: Rs 459  Since February 2024, ITC has been consolidating within Rs 445-400 levels, representing strong consolidation and accumulation. However, with 6 percent weekly gains, the stock has decisively broken out of this consolidation on a closing basis. This breakout is accompanied by huge volumes, indicating increased participation. The stock is well placed above its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day SMA, and these averages are also inching up along with the price rise, which reaffirms the bullish trend. The daily and weekly ""Bollinger band"" buy signal suggests increased momentum. The daily, weekly, and monthly strength indicator RSI is in positive terrain, which justifies rising strength across all the time frames. Investors should buy, hold, and accumulate this stock.

It has also decisively broken out past a 6-8 months ""multiple resistance zone"" around Rs 285-300 levels, indicating a strong comeback of bulls. Huge rising volumes signify increased participation. The weekly ""Bollinger band"" buy signal suggests increased momentum. The stock is placed above its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day SMA, and these averages are also inching up along with the price rise, which reaffirms the bullish trend. The daily, weekly, and monthly strength indicator RSI is in positive terrain, which justifies rising strength across all the time frames. Investors should buy, hold, and accumulate this stock. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 356, Rs 375 Stop-Loss: Rs 313, Rs 300 Dr Lal PathLabs | CMP: Rs 2,950.85  Since January 2022, Dr. Lal PathLabs has been consolidating within a broad trading range (Rs 2,860-1,800); however, on the weekly time frame, the stock has confirmed a trend reversal, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms indicating a positive bias.

Recently, the stock broke out of this range with significant trading volume, making it an attractive buy opportunity. Despite a rally of nearly 40 rupees post-breakout, it is recommended to purchase on any dips. From a technical standpoint, the daily MACD (moving average convergence divergence) has formed a bullish crossover just above the zero line, indicating a positive trend. Therefore, it is advisable to buy within the Rs 335-350 range, aiming for an upside target of Rs 425. To mitigate risk, a stop-loss should be set at Rs 315 on a daily closing basis.

Targeting $50 bn valuation for IIHL's BFSI portfolio by 2030; hopeful of quick IRDAI nod for RCap buyout: Ashok Hinduja,"My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Days after making a foray into the asset management space with the acquisition of a majority stake in US-based Invesco AMC’s India arm, IIHL (IndusInd International Holdings) Chairman Ashoka Hinduja announced ambitious plans for the firm's expanding para banking portfolio which is targeting a valuation of $50 billion by 2030. IIHL is the promoter of IndusInd Bank and is also the entity which received the NCLT's (National Company Law Tribunal) nod for the buyout of Reliance Capital under the insolvency and bankruptcy code. The revised $50 billion target is 25 per cent higher than the earlier one set by IIHL ""That (IIHL's BFSI portfolio valuation target) has changed and by 2030, it's going to be $50 billion. See, the time has come for digitization. Importance will be given to get value and move fast to create digitization. The more you get into technology, the valuation will go up. This will be to complete our BFSI suite,"" Ashok Hinduja said in response to a query by Moneycontrol during a media briefing in Mumbai. On October 25, 2023, Ashok Hinduja had told Moneycontrol in an interview at Carlton House Terrace, London, UK that the group is evaluating targets and eyeing a valuation of $35 billion to $40 billion in the BFSI segment by 2030. IIHL's plans to acquire Invesco Asset Management India Ltd were first reported by Moneycontrol on April 2. The transaction was officially announced later on April 9. Elaborating further on IIHL's expansion plans , Ashok Hinduja added, "" As far as IIHL is concerned, they are open for anything. The pockets are full. (If) any opportunity will come, we will definitely take a look. I would say not only in India, we will look at opportunities outside India also. So, take an example, currently due diligence is going on for a bank in Switzerland, in Liechtenstein, in Germany, and another in Luxembourg. The plan is four entities under one umbrella and the due diligence is going on. So if everything goes well, we'll have it."" In response to a query on reform priorities of the new government post elections, Hinduja cited the example of China and called for new policies for overseas Indians to boost remittances and facilitate greater participation by them in the India growth story. The Reliance Capital buyout and the road ahead IIHL has received clearance from Sebi, CCI (Competition Commission of India) and RBI and is awaiting the green signal from the insurance sector regulator IRDAI for the Rs 9,661 crore Reliance Capital acquisition. May 27 has been set as the deadline by the bankruptcy court to conclude the purchase and funding has been tied up for the deal, according to Hinduja. According to media reports, initially, the IRDAI had expressed reservations about the shareholding structure of IIHL in a letter to the administrator. When asked about the pending decision of the IRDAI, Hinduja shared, "" I am hopeful that the approval will come as quickly as possible. Normally, the approval process takes two to three months. The original information (application) was submitted in November, 2023. So, if we check the timeline, we'd say that the IRDAI was provided with whatever information they required, right from November onwards. So, I think they would move fast with the approval process. If you ask me, are we ready for the 27th? We are ready for even 15th May."" Rival suitor Torrent Investments has moved the Supreme Court, seeking the latter's intervention in the NCLT approved sale of Reliance Capital to IIHL. Will that be a hurdle? Hinduja doesn't think so and said, "" Supreme Court, we are not waiting because Supreme Court has clearly stated, there is no stay on the process. So, whether that comes or not, the transaction will move."" When will IIHL hike its stake in IndusInd Bank? Post issuance of guidelines by RBI on Ownership and Governance in Private Banks, in February 2005, IIHL brought down its stake to the current level of 15 per cent in IndusInd Bank, the country's fifth largest private sector lender. It has approached the RBI for an increase in its shareholding in IndusInd Bank from 15 per cent to 26 per cent, post acceptance of recommendations of Internal Working Group (IWG) of the RBI to this effect. Asked about the status of the stake hike plans, Hinduja said the regulatory process is underway and he is hoping to hear from the RBI in a few weeks. ""There is a policy of the regulator. We have received the letter, which clearly said to follow the process, as per guidelines. The various forms have to be completed and the same has gone to IndusInd Bank. The bank has also cleared it through its board. Now it has gone to the regulator. I am hoping that maybe in a week or two weeks we should get their response. Once we get that, then we'll start the process of raising the capital through the bank or through the market. Or we will create a combination,"" Hinduja added. He was quick to add that the proposed stake hike in IndusInd Bank would not be carried out at one go. ""I need more than one and a half billion dollars. But I will not do (hike stake) at one time. Because if I do that, that means I'm giving that money to the bank. I don't want to spoil the management. What will they do with that money? So as and when the growth pattern will come, the funds will be provided. And I can't go in the market and start acquiring, because I need a wide base,"" he clarified. Last July, IIHL had announced that it had decided to raise capital of $1.5 billion to increase its holding in IndusInd Bank and to fund its acquisition of debt-ridden Reliance Capital. Incidentally, an overseas initial public offer is also in the works for the Mauritius based IIHL, which has over 600 high net-worth shareholders keen on an exit at the appropriate time and valuation. During the media interaction, Hinduja indicated that the firm could be listed on Afrinex, the largest stock exchange of Mauritius.

Targeting $50 bn valuation for IIHL's BFSI portfolio by 2030; hopeful of quick IRDAI nod for RCap buyout: Ashok Hinduja,"My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Days after making a foray into the asset management space with the acquisition of a majority stake in US-based Invesco AMC’s India arm, IIHL (IndusInd International Holdings) Chairman Ashoka Hinduja announced ambitious plans for the firm's expanding para banking portfolio which is targeting a valuation of $50 billion by 2030. IIHL is the promoter of IndusInd Bank and is also the entity which received the NCLT's (National Company Law Tribunal) nod for the buyout of Reliance Capital under the insolvency and bankruptcy code. The revised $50 billion target is 25 per cent higher than the earlier one set by IIHL ""That (IIHL's BFSI portfolio valuation target) has changed and by 2030, it's going to be $50 billion. See, the time has come for digitization. Importance will be given to get value and move fast to create digitization. The more you get into technology, the valuation will go up. This will be to complete our BFSI suite,"" Ashok Hinduja said in response to a query by Moneycontrol during a media briefing in Mumbai. On October 25, 2023, Ashok Hinduja had told Moneycontrol in an interview at Carlton House Terrace, London, UK that the group is evaluating targets and eyeing a valuation of $35 billion to $40 billion in the BFSI segment by 2030. IIHL's plans to acquire Invesco Asset Management India Ltd were first reported by Moneycontrol on April 2. The transaction was officially announced later on April 9. Elaborating further on IIHL's expansion plans , Ashok Hinduja added, "" As far as IIHL is concerned, they are open for anything. The pockets are full. (If) any opportunity will come, we will definitely take a look. I would say not only in India, we will look at opportunities outside India also. So, take an example, currently due diligence is going on for a bank in Switzerland, in Liechtenstein, in Germany, and another in Luxembourg. The plan is four entities under one umbrella and the due diligence is going on. So if everything goes well, we'll have it."" In response to a query on reform priorities of the new government post elections, Hinduja cited the example of China and called for new policies for overseas Indians to boost remittances and facilitate greater participation by them in the India growth story. The Reliance Capital buyout and the road ahead IIHL has received clearance from Sebi, CCI (Competition Commission of India) and RBI and is awaiting the green signal from the insurance sector regulator IRDAI for the Rs 9,661 crore Reliance Capital acquisition. May 27 has been set as the deadline by the bankruptcy court to conclude the purchase and funding has been tied up for the deal, according to Hinduja. According to media reports, initially, the IRDAI had expressed reservations about the shareholding structure of IIHL in a letter to the administrator. When asked about the pending decision of the IRDAI, Hinduja shared, "" I am hopeful that the approval will come as quickly as possible. Normally, the approval process takes two to three months. The original information (application) was submitted in November, 2023. So, if we check the timeline, we'd say that the IRDAI was provided with whatever information they required, right from November onwards. So, I think they would move fast with the approval process. If you ask me, are we ready for the 27th? We are ready for even 15th May."" Rival suitor Torrent Investments has moved the Supreme Court, seeking the latter's intervention in the NCLT approved sale of Reliance Capital to IIHL. Will that be a hurdle? Hinduja doesn't think so and said, "" Supreme Court, we are not waiting because Supreme Court has clearly stated, there is no stay on the process. So, whether that comes or not, the transaction will move."" When will IIHL hike its stake in IndusInd Bank? Post issuance of guidelines by RBI on Ownership and Governance in Private Banks, in February 2005, IIHL brought down its stake to the current level of 15 per cent in IndusInd Bank, the country's fifth largest private sector lender. It has approached the RBI for an increase in its shareholding in IndusInd Bank from 15 per cent to 26 per cent, post acceptance of recommendations of Internal Working Group (IWG) of the RBI to this effect. Asked about the status of the stake hike plans, Hinduja said the regulatory process is underway and he is hoping to hear from the RBI in a few weeks. ""There is a policy of the regulator. We have received the letter, which clearly said to follow the process, as per guidelines. The various forms have to be completed and the same has gone to IndusInd Bank. The bank has also cleared it through its board. Now it has gone to the regulator. I am hoping that maybe in a week or two weeks we should get their response. Once we get that, then we'll start the process of raising the capital through the bank or through the market. Or we will create a combination,"" Hinduja added. He was quick to add that the proposed stake hike in IndusInd Bank would not be carried out at one go. ""I need more than one and a half billion dollars. But I will not do (hike stake) at one time. Because if I do that, that means I'm giving that money to the bank. I don't want to spoil the management. What will they do with that money? So as and when the growth pattern will come, the funds will be provided. And I can't go in the market and start acquiring, because I need a wide base,"" he clarified. Last July, IIHL had announced that it had decided to raise capital of $1.5 billion to increase its holding in IndusInd Bank and to fund its acquisition of debt-ridden Reliance Capital. Incidentally, an overseas initial public offer is also in the works for the Mauritius based IIHL, which has over 600 high net-worth shareholders keen on an exit at the appropriate time and valuation. During the media interaction, Hinduja indicated that the firm could be listed on Afrinex, the largest stock exchange of Mauritius. In the earlier interaction with Moneycontrol in October, he said jurisdictions like the UK, Singapore, Dubai and Luxembourg were also being considered as potential listing destinations for IIHL.

US: $200 billion of M&A wasn't enough in oil patch,"My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Even after a record $200 billion dealmaking frenzy last year, US oil and gas producers haven’t consolidated nearly enough. On a-per-barrel basis, there are still too many companies, too many chief executives, and too many drilling rigs wooing a limited pool of available capital. The solution is simple: more M&A.  Granted, the industry is today a lot slimmer than it once was. If you attend industry events where people still exchange business cards – rather than pair iPhones — and you keep a rolodex, just flip through it to see how much has changed since the pandemic. I did so a few weeks ago as I was setting up a meetings ahead of an industry conference in Houston. The result was a trip down memory lane: Anadarko Petroleum, among the first to go; Whiting Petroleum, merged and re-named; Endeavor Energy Resources, about to disappear; Cimarex Energy, merged; Concho Resources, long gone; Encana Corp., rebranded. The list goes on. Still, if my own worn-out rolodex serves as any reference, there is plenty of scope left for a fresh round of consolidation. Few outside the industry know them, but there are plenty of independent exploration and production (E&P) companies in the US.  The segment to focus on is publicly listed firms with a market value under $25 billion – but above $1 billion. In no particular order, as I flip my cards, the bracket includes the likes of EQT Corp, Coterra Energy Inc, Marathon Oil Corp, Ovintiv Inc, Permian Resources Corp, Matador Resources Co, APA Corp and Civitas Resources Inc. They’re not household names, but for M&A bankers and lawyers I speak to, they’re all candidates for consolidation. I struggle to believe that by the end of the year, some of the above names wouldn’t have either bought someone else or been acquired. Bigger isn’t always better, but with Wall Street generalist investors largely ignoring oil stocks under $25 billion in market value, boards of directors necessarily need to prioritize size. Some companies may achieve growth in earnings per share by buying back their own stock. But not everyone has that luxury. That’s why more M&A is needed, and it’s already coming: Year-to-date, North American oil and gas companies have already announced nearly $50 billion in deals. If sustained at a similar pace throughout the year, it would nearly match 2023’s record activity. In most cases, either small and medium-sized E&P firms combine among themselves, or they would be prey for larger companies — ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy Corp and EOG Resources Inc, three potential 2024 acquirers, if you believe the chatter among bankers and lawyers. Until now, industry consolidation has followed two broad trends. In the first, large companies with operations across the country bought smaller ones , as Occidental Petroleum Corp has done since 2019. The second involved smaller E&P outfits buying or merging with peers in the same region they operate, creating pure-play basin champions — think Diamondback Energy Inc.’s deals consolidating the Permian basin of Texas and New Mexico, and those of Chord Energy Corp, now a champion of the Bakken basin of North Dakota. For this year and 2025, we could see multi-basin deals. While companies with diversified geographical portfolios typically have a tougher time selling their vision, E&P outfits may need to make a virtue out of necessity: Without multi-basin dealmaking, companies may struggle to grow further as some reach the limits of their current geographies. As much as investors love the pure-play story, there’s merit to not having all  your eggs in one basket. The two bigger obstacles for the next consolidation phase start with a “p”: politics and prices. First, the politics. The US Federal Trade Commission is already scrutinizing the last round of M&A oil deals, and Democrats in Washington are calling for antitrust investigations. “These deals are likely to harm competition, risking increased consumer prices and reduced output throughout the United States,” a group of senators wrote in a November letter to Lina Khan, the head of the FTC. Misguided as they are, the calls are likely to get louder as the election date nears. Ultimately, the FTC is unlikely to block the deals, but it can delay dealmaking by requesting more documents. So the first of the “p” would more likely delay than derail the deals. The second “p” could prove more of an obstacle, however. The industry consolidated over the last decade in part thanks to moderating oil prices, with the exception of the 2021-22 spike as Russia invaded Ukraine. When oil prices stay low, the bid-ask spread between sellers and buyers of companies narrows. The opposite is true when prices surge. Push oil prices to $100 a barrel, and deals become more complicated. Thus, the American oil patch will see more M&A in 2024, but whether the activity comes close to last year may depend on forces beyond its control.

"Indus Towers expects growth as Airtel, Vodafone Idea expand: Analysts","My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Indus Towers expects capex intensity to remain high in the current financial year, as Bharti Airtel aggressively rolls out towers and Vodafone Idea (Vi)expands 4G and launches 5G, the management has told analysts. “Indus expects a fair share in VIL’s expansion despite the risk of higher competitive intensity. The company has an advantage from its pan-India tower portfolio, good footprint in past VIL radio frequency planning, and strong execution track record. Nonetheless, it remains cautious about competition,” ICICI Securities said in a note after a meeting with Indus Towers chief financial officer Vikas Poddar. Indus management told analysts it anticipates overdue recovery from Vodafone Idea of up to Rs 5,400 crore. Indus has been collecting 100 percent of receivables every month since January 2023 and more in the third and fourth quarters of FY24, as a result there was some unwinding in provision for doubtful debts. In June, Vodafone PLC, the telco’s UK-based parent, in June sold an 18 percent stake in Indus for 1.7 billion euros (approximately Rs 15,300 crore). “Monetisation of Indus stake held by Vodafone Plc can aid partial recovery of overdue. Indus has a stated dividend policy that any FCF generated by the company will be used to pay the dividend, and Vodafone Idea's overdue recovery should boost FCF in FY25,” the brokerage said in a note seen by Moneycontrol. Expanding networks Vodafone Idea is expected to roll out over 60,000 tenancies in the next few quarters, a lucrative opportunity for the Indian tower industry. “Indus has been in discussion with Vodafone Idea. Indus believes it has a relevant network footprint, as network designing was done based on past requirements for its anchor tenants. This puts Indus in a better position vs. its peers,” the brokerage said. Indus has also completed network expansion into a deep market for Bharti Airtel, which VIL can use for its rollout with sharing benefits. Indus has improved its execution capabilities in the past few years, which has helped Bharti Airtel widen its rural footprint effectively and promptly. “VIL will have to expand its 4G network footprint faster to regain lost ground; thus, Indus’ strong track record of execution can come in handy,” ICICI Securities said. Also read: Bharti Airtel in talks with Vodafone to buy 3% more stake in Indus Towers; may merge with data unit On the other hand, Bharti Airtel, which owns 48.95 percent stake in the Indus, has guided 25,000 site additions, primarily to cover the remaining rural locations, having seen success in FY24 with 46,000 sites. “Indus believes that it has captured higher incremental market share from Bharti’s rural expansion and will continue to expand towers to meet Bharti’s requirements even in FY25,” the brokerage said. The tower company expects the momentum to continue in FY25. In its interaction with the brokerage, Indus Tower’s management cautioned that tower and tenancy expansion is cyclical. “The tenancy/tower addition may pause, and future expansion will be linked with data capacity enhancement. 5G is now rolled out as loading, and considering the baseband is 3300MHz, and as data capacities rise, 5G will also require infill sites in the future, driving tenancy/tower demand for Indus,” it added. According to ICICI Securities, Indus Tower’s rental per tenant is likely to rise 0.1 percent sequentially, partly driven by higher loading revenue on the 5G rollout and a rise in single-tenancy towers, offsetting the adverse impact from equalisation/renewal. Rental revenue may rise 1.2 percent sequentially (+6.9 percent year on year) to Rs 46 billion (Rs 4,600 crore), ICICI Securities said. It expects earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) to decline 6.2 percent sequentially (up 9.7 percent YoY) to Rs 38 billion (Rs 3800 crore), as the previous quarter benefited from a provision reversal. “We expect net profit to drop by 12.6 percent sequentially (up 20.2 percent YoY) to Rs 16 billion (Rs 1600 crore),” it said. JM Financial, in a separate note, said Indus' revenue is likely to grow 5.1 percent sequentially to Rs 76 billion (Rs 7,600 crore). Its expects EBITDA to improve 2 percent sequentially to Rs 42 billion (Rs 4,200 crore), assuming Rs 3-4 billion (Rs 300-Rs 400 crore) of provision write-back as seen in 4QFY24. The likely normalisation of the energy EBITDA margin to NIL aids this. “We build in ~7.1k net tenancy additions in 1QFY25 for Indus Towers vs ~7.9k in 4QFY24; we expect strong tower additions at ~7k, primarily driven by Bharti’s continued rural expansion. However, we assume that rentals will be flat QoQ,” JM Financial said.

"Indus Towers expects growth as Airtel, Vodafone Idea expand: Analysts","My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Indus Towers expects capex intensity to remain high in the current financial year, as Bharti Airtel aggressively rolls out towers and Vodafone Idea (Vi)expands 4G and launches 5G, the management has told analysts. “Indus expects a fair share in VIL’s expansion despite the risk of higher competitive intensity. The company has an advantage from its pan-India tower portfolio, good footprint in past VIL radio frequency planning, and strong execution track record. Nonetheless, it remains cautious about competition,” ICICI Securities said in a note after a meeting with Indus Towers chief financial officer Vikas Poddar. Indus management told analysts it anticipates overdue recovery from Vodafone Idea of up to Rs 5,400 crore. Indus has been collecting 100 percent of receivables every month since January 2023 and more in the third and fourth quarters of FY24, as a result there was some unwinding in provision for doubtful debts. In June, Vodafone PLC, the telco’s UK-based parent, in June sold an 18 percent stake in Indus for 1.7 billion euros (approximately Rs 15,300 crore). “Monetisation of Indus stake held by Vodafone Plc can aid partial recovery of overdue. Indus has a stated dividend policy that any FCF generated by the company will be used to pay the dividend, and Vodafone Idea's overdue recovery should boost FCF in FY25,” the brokerage said in a note seen by Moneycontrol. Expanding networks Vodafone Idea is expected to roll out over 60,000 tenancies in the next few quarters, a lucrative opportunity for the Indian tower industry. “Indus has been in discussion with Vodafone Idea. Indus believes it has a relevant network footprint, as network designing was done based on past requirements for its anchor tenants. This puts Indus in a better position vs. its peers,” the brokerage said. Indus has also completed network expansion into a deep market for Bharti Airtel, which VIL can use for its rollout with sharing benefits. Indus has improved its execution capabilities in the past few years, which has helped Bharti Airtel widen its rural footprint effectively and promptly. “VIL will have to expand its 4G network footprint faster to regain lost ground; thus, Indus’ strong track record of execution can come in handy,” ICICI Securities said. Also read: Bharti Airtel in talks with Vodafone to buy 3% more stake in Indus Towers; may merge with data unit On the other hand, Bharti Airtel, which owns 48.95 percent stake in the Indus, has guided 25,000 site additions, primarily to cover the remaining rural locations, having seen success in FY24 with 46,000 sites. “Indus believes that it has captured higher incremental market share from Bharti’s rural expansion and will continue to expand towers to meet Bharti’s requirements even in FY25,” the brokerage said. The tower company expects the momentum to continue in FY25. In its interaction with the brokerage, Indus Tower’s management cautioned that tower and tenancy expansion is cyclical. “The tenancy/tower addition may pause, and future expansion will be linked with data capacity enhancement. 5G is now rolled out as loading, and considering the baseband is 3300MHz, and as data capacities rise, 5G will also require infill sites in the future, driving tenancy/tower demand for Indus,” it added. According to ICICI Securities, Indus Tower’s rental per tenant is likely to rise 0.1 percent sequentially, partly driven by higher loading revenue on the 5G rollout and a rise in single-tenancy towers, offsetting the adverse impact from equalisation/renewal. Rental revenue may rise 1.2 percent sequentially (+6.9 percent year on year) to Rs 46 billion (Rs 4,600 crore), ICICI Securities said. It expects earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) to decline 6.2 percent sequentially (up 9.7 percent YoY) to Rs 38 billion (Rs 3800 crore), as the previous quarter benefited from a provision reversal. “We expect net profit to drop by 12.6 percent sequentially (up 20.2 percent YoY) to Rs 16 billion (Rs 1600 crore),” it said. JM Financial, in a separate note, said Indus' revenue is likely to grow 5.1 percent sequentially to Rs 76 billion (Rs 7,600 crore). Its expects EBITDA to improve 2 percent sequentially to Rs 42 billion (Rs 4,200 crore), assuming Rs 3-4 billion (Rs 300-Rs 400 crore) of provision write-back as seen in 4QFY24. The likely normalisation of the energy EBITDA margin to NIL aids this. “We build in ~7.1k net tenancy additions in 1QFY25 for Indus Towers vs ~7.9k in 4QFY24; we expect strong tower additions at ~7k, primarily driven by Bharti’s continued rural expansion. However, we assume that rentals will be flat QoQ,” JM Financial said. At 10.30 am, the Indus Tower stock was trading at Rs 417.65 on the National Stock Exchange, up 2.65 percent from the previous close.

DoT asks telcos to pay for 5G spectrum sold in June auction,"My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now The department of telecommunications (DoT) has sent demand notices to all three private telecom operators –Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea – for their spectrum purchases and asked them to pay the amount in 10 days. Sources familiar with the matter said the demand notices were sent on July 16 after the Union finance ministry approved them. Moneycontrol has seen a copy of demand notices to all the three telcos. The telecom department has given telecom operators with two payment options, according to DoT documents. The first option permits companies to make either the full payment or a portion of the upfront payment, covering a minimum of two years and extendable in whole-year increments. Operators opting for this method can benefit from a moratorium corresponding to the upfront payment period. The remaining balance will be paid in equal installments over the remaining term, with annual payments due at the beginning of each year. This ensures the net present value (NPV) of the bid amount is maintained at the applicable interest rate. These annual installments must be paid on the anniversary of the effective date each year, as stipulated in the notice inviting applications (NIA) document. The second option entails paying the bid amount in 20 equal annual installments, also maintaining the NPV at the applicable interest rate, with payments required at the start of each year. Telecom operators are also required to pay the applicable GST on the demands issued by the DoT. In the recent spectrum auction, which concluded on June 26, Bharti Airtel made a substantial investment, acquiring 97 MHz of 5G airwaves worth Rs 6,856.76 crore. Vodafone Idea also made a notable purchase, securing 30 MHz of 5G spectrum for Rs 3,510.40 crore. Reliance Jio, on the other hand, made its lowest-ever investment in spectrum auctions, buying spectrum worth Rs 973.62 crore. According to the notice inviting applications, telecom operators must make the payment within 10 days of receiving the demand note. Spectrum can then be allocated within 30 days after they make either the first instalment or the full payment, depending on their chosen option. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have renewed spectrum in circles where permits were expiring, receiving provisional spectrum in those areas. The government raised a modest Rs 11,340.78 crore from its second 5G spectrum sale, with Bharti Airtel emerging as the top buyer amid predictably subdued bidding activity. Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group. Network18 is controlled by Independent Media Trust, of which Reliance Industries is the sole beneficiary.

Government officials and the telecom regulator have no intention to intervene and are likely to remain neutral over the issue of price hikes, the report said. The officials also highlighted that the tariffs in the country are among the lowest in the world, according to the report. Last week saw Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea announced new data unlimited plans and revision in rates. Jio emphasised its commitment to affordable internet access and highlighted its rapidly expanding 5G network, which boasts nearly 85 percent of India’s operational 5G cells.

"Last 10,000-point Sensex rally had these five stocks shining the brightest","My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now A Moneycontrol analysis shows that only a handful of stocks have accounted for a significant part of the last 10,000-point upmove on Sensex, which was its fastest ever. Only five stocks have accounted for 50 percent of rise in the valuation of the benchmark Sensex. The next eleven stocks in terms of highest rise in market capitalisation contributed another 30 percent to overall valuation. The market cap of five Sensex stocks - Reliance Industries, Bharti Airtel, State Bank of India, Mahindra & Mahindra and ICICI Bank – registered a cumulative rise of Rs 11.85 lakh crore in the period between December 11, 2023 and July 3. Experts believe that stocks that are expected to show robust earnings growth are leading the gains in the indices and overall market as well. Interestingly, the market cap of seven stocks from the Sensex pack had declined during this period. Asian Paints was the biggest laggard followed by ITC and Titan Company. Other stocks on the losing side include Bajaj Finserv, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Indusind Bank and Bajaj Finance. It took just 138 trading sessions to move from 70,000 to 80,000 to register its fastest ever 10000-points journey.  The market capitalisation of benchmark Sensex rose from Rs 136.89 lakh crore on December 11, 2023 when it hit the 70,000-mark to a little over Rs 158 lakh crore on July 3 – a gain of Rs 21.2 lakh crore.

Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now A Moneycontrol analysis shows that only a handful of stocks have accounted for a significant part of the last 10,000-point upmove on Sensex, which was its fastest ever. Only five stocks have accounted for 50 percent of rise in the valuation of the benchmark Sensex. The next eleven stocks in terms of highest rise in market capitalisation contributed another 30 percent to overall valuation. The market cap of five Sensex stocks - Reliance Industries, Bharti Airtel, State Bank of India, Mahindra & Mahindra and ICICI Bank – registered a cumulative rise of Rs 11.85 lakh crore in the period between December 11, 2023 and July 3. Experts believe that stocks that are expected to show robust earnings growth are leading the gains in the indices and overall market as well. Interestingly, the market cap of seven stocks from the Sensex pack had declined during this period. Asian Paints was the biggest laggard followed by ITC and Titan Company. Other stocks on the losing side include Bajaj Finserv, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Indusind Bank and Bajaj Finance. It took just 138 trading sessions to move from 70,000 to 80,000 to register its fastest ever 10000-points journey.  The market capitalisation of benchmark Sensex rose from Rs 136.89 lakh crore on December 11, 2023 when it hit the 70,000-mark to a little over Rs 158 lakh crore on July 3 – a gain of Rs 21.2 lakh crore.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade TCS, SBI Life, India Cements, Tata Consumer, Canara Bank, and others on Friday?","My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now The market recorded a new closing high after gaining strength in the afternoon on July 18, following a couple of days of consolidation. The Nifty 50 was up 188 points, or 0.76 percent, at 24,801. About 1,618 shares advanced against 728 declining shares on the NSE. The Nifty is likely to maintain an upward rally towards 24,900-25,000, with immediate support at 24,600-24,500 levels. Here are some trading ideas for the near term: Amol Athawale, VP-Technical Research at Kotak Securities Canara Bank | CMP: Rs 115.77  Post decline from higher levels, Canara Bank rebounded from its demand zone and witnessed a steady recovery from the lower levels. Additionally, on the daily charts, the counter has given a breakout from its sloping channel formation. The up moves in the counter suggest a new leg of the bullish trend from the current levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 125 Stop-Loss: Rs 110 DLF | CMP: Rs 844.9  DLF is in the accumulation zone, trading in a rangebound mode for the past few sessions. The texture of the chart formation and the technical indicator RSI (Relative Strength Index) indicate that the counter is very likely to break out from the rectangle formation for a new leg of the up move in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 905 Stop-Loss: Rs 815 Bata India | CMP: Rs 1,530.45  Bata India has shown a robust rally from the lower levels in recent sessions. Additionally, it is continuously trading in an ascending triangle chart formation along with decent volume activity on the daily scale. Therefore, the overall formation indicates a likely breakout for a new leg of the up move in the coming horizon. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,640 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,470 Mandar Bhojane, Equity Research Analyst at Choice Broking Tata Consultancy Services | CMP: Rs 4,315.55  TCS has recently broken out of its range on the daily chart with a significant increase in trading volume, indicating a potential breakout. If the price manages to close above Rs 4,320, it may have the potential to reach short-term targets of Rs 4,600 and Rs 4,900.

In his message to shareholders in the annual report, Singh said the company will continue to focus on corporate governance, operational excellence and upholding the value of the company's founders. ""Our focus is to expand both our businesses, residential and commercial. The residential business continued its growth momentum, we witnessed an uptick in new sales bookings, coupled with record sales collections. ""The markets response to our products continues to be very encouraging. It is with this conviction that we are entering new geographies like Mumbai and Goa,"" he said. While the company continues to launch new projects in Delhi-NCR, Singh said the company's strategy is to introduce a diverse range of offerings to meet the aspirational needs of the market. DLF has achieved strong sales bookings during the last two financial years, driven by significant surge in demand for its luxury homes. In the 2022-23 fiscal, it clocked a record sales of Rs 15,058 crore, while the company reported a sales of Rs 14,778 crore in the 2023-24 financial year. For the current fiscal (2024-25), DLF has set a 15 per cent growth target in sales bookings at Rs 17,000 crore as it plans to launch many luxury housing projects across Gurugram, Goa, and Mumbai. DLF's Chairman said the commercial business (development of office buildings, shopping centres) continues to perform well and the occupancy levels across the portfolio have increased substantially. ""The company continues to invest in the capex of our new build-outs in Gurugram, Chennai, Delhi and Goa,"" he said.

""While we strive for greater heights, I assure you that we will maintain our focus on operational excellence, corporate governance and uphold the values established by our founders, which remain our foundation and guiding principle. Our aim is to achieve long-term sustainable growth for all our stakeholders,"" Singh said. On the overall economic situation of the country, the DLF Chairman said the Indian economy has staged a broad-based recovery across sectors and surpassed its pre-pandemic growth trajectory. ""Over the last decade, wide ranging structural and governance reforms have strengthened the economy's fundamentals which has made India the shining star in the global economy. The sustained growth momentum reaffirms the ability of the Indian economy to grow faster than ever."" He said he strongly believes that the next decade will belong to India. On the new government, Singh said, ""The third term of the government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji marks a milestone in good governance. This continuity will result in faster rollout of policies with renewed vigour for growth."" He said the pace of progress and improvements will accelerate growth in years to come. ""The government is investing heavily in infrastructure, highways, railways, electrification and other sectors. All progress in the new build-out cycle paves the way to achieve the Prime Minister's vision for 'Viksit Bharat 2047', which coincides with the Nation's 100th year of independence,"" Singh said. DLF's Chairman believes that the real estate sector will be a major contributor to India's economic progress, resulting in employment subsequently leading to macroeconomic and social growth.

Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Avenue Supermarts D’Mart 1Q25 results were in-line with our estimates indicating stabilization in operating parameters, as sale/store grew by 4.7% & sales/ft grew by 4.4% YoY despite opening larger size stores. Cost of retail inched up by 45bps YoY as Operating cost went up amid investments in improving service sales & building capability for the future, resulting in EBITDA margin miss of 17bps on our estimates. D’Mart added 6 stores in 1Q25 with size of each store higher by 50/20% YoY/QoQ. We estimate D’Mart to add 45 stores in FY25 (41 stores in FY24), with sustained focus on Tier-2/Tier-3 cities and potential to further accelerate store openings in coming years. General merchandise and apparel improved in 1Q25 sustaining momentum, which started from FY24 Diwali. We believe full recovery in apparel looks difficult given rising influence of value formats like Zudio, and Reliance Trends.

Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Avenue Supermarts D’Mart 1Q25 results were in-line with our estimates indicating stabilization in operating parameters, as sale/store grew by 4.7% & sales/ft grew by 4.4% YoY despite opening larger size stores. Cost of retail inched up by 45bps YoY as Operating cost went up amid investments in improving service sales & building capability for the future, resulting in EBITDA margin miss of 17bps on our estimates. D’Mart added 6 stores in 1Q25 with size of each store higher by 50/20% YoY/QoQ. We estimate D’Mart to add 45 stores in FY25 (41 stores in FY24), with sustained focus on Tier-2/Tier-3 cities and potential to further accelerate store openings in coming years. General merchandise and apparel improved in 1Q25 sustaining momentum, which started from FY24 Diwali. We believe full recovery in apparel looks difficult given rising influence of value formats like Zudio, and Reliance Trends. We factor in 45/50 store additions with 21% CAGR in sales & 29 bps margin expansion, which will enable 25% PAT CAGR over FY24-26.

"DMart Q1 Preview: Increasing footfalls, store count to drive 21% jump in profit","My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Rakesh Damani-led Avenue Supermarts (DMart) is set to present its earnings report for the first fiscal quarter of FY25 on July 13. High productivity and additions in footprints are likely to drive the retail major’s sales in the high-teens. According to a Moneycontrol poll, the DMart parent is expected to record a 17.5 percent on-year rise in revenue to Rs 13,938 crore. Net profit is likely to surge 21 percent from Rs 659 crore in the corresponding quarter in the previous fiscal to Rs 798 crore.  Earnings estimates of analysts polled by Moneycontrol are in a narrow range, so any positive or negative surprises may elicit a sharp reaction in the stock. What factors are driving the earnings? Top factors driving earnings are rising revenue per square foot, stable margins and store additions. ""DMart's revenue is likely to grow at 18 percent YoY driven by higher inflation and store expansion. We expect a marginal improvement in the sale of general merchandise as consumer sentiment improves,"" said Antique Stock Broking. Rising revenue per square foot: Over the past four quarters, the revenue per square foot has been on the rise. In comparison, during the preceding three years, the revenue per square foot remained subdued due to the addition of large-size stores and weak discretionary spending (which has a revenue contribution of 23-25 percent). “This trend has been reversing gradually for the last 4-5 quarters, which is evident from the narrowing gap between revenue/store growth and revenue/sqft growth,” said Motilal Oswal. Store additions: Besides, during the quarter gone by, Avenue Supermarts added six stores over the quarter, taking its total store count to 371 stores across the country. In the fourth quarter of the previous financial year, DMart added 24 stores. In the same quarter last year, Avenue Supermarts' store count increased by three stores. Stable margins: Gross margins are likely to be stable, with general merchandise & apparel (GM&A), which is a high-margin segment, seeing its contribution improve. “We expect DMart to report a gross margin of 14.6 percent, compared to 14.6 percent in Q1FY24 and a pre-Covid Q1 average of 15.7 percent,” said Nuvama Institutional Equities. What to look out for in the quarterly show? Analysts will be closely looking at the SSSG, also known as the same store sales growth. They will also monitor the change in revenue per square foot, along with the gap between the revenue/store and revenue/sqft.

Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Nomura has reduced its target price for MedPlus Health Services to Rs 931 from Rs 982 while reiterating its ""Buy"" rating. This adjustment comes in the wake of recent disruptions that have negatively impacted investor sentiment and the company's performance since its December 2021 listing. MedPlus shares have seen a 16 percent decline in their stock value since its IPO. At 9.17 AM, MedPlus shares were flat at Rs 669.55. The new target price set by Nomura represents a 39 percent potential upside in MedPlus shares. The stock has fallen 0ver 10 percent in the past six months while Nifty 50 has gained 13 percent during the same time frame. MedPlus's operating EBITDA margin has fallen by 150 basis points between FY22 and FY24 primarily due to aggressive new store expansions, the company's entry into diagnostics, and the introduction of low-cost generics. While the new store revenue ramp-up has met expectations, the diagnostics business is currently near break-even and expansion plans are limited to Hyderabad. Follow our live blog for all the market action Nomura said that the transition to low-cost generics and the rebranding of high-margin private labels have initially impacted revenue and gross profit by approximately 3.5 percent and 15 percent, respectively. However, the substantial increase in volumes has offset these impacts. Nomura said that it anticipates a marginal reduction in current discounts which is likely to help improve the operating EBITDA. Nomura's report suggests that, despite recent challenges, MedPlus Health is well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing shift in the pharmacy sector from unorganised to organised segments and the rising demand for low-cost generics.

"After Mukul Agarwal, HDFC Mutual Fund and ADIA are lapping up this garment exporter","My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now This apparel maker isn't a newcomer to the market. Incorporated in 1987 and listed in 2007, the garment exporter has consistently remained profitable, maintaining double-digit return ratios over the past decade. The pandemic hit hard, with net profit dropping to an all-time low of Rs 17 crore in March 2012, but the company has since rebounded sharply, with profits soaring to Rs 168 crore in March 2024. Reflecting this impressive earnings performance, its stock price has skyrocketed from Rs 50 in January 2020 to Rs 835 currently, with no signs of stopping. On Tuesday, shares of Pearl Global surged 11 percent intraday, closing over nine percent higher. At 11 am on July 18, the stock was trading at Rs 823, down 1.2 percent. Ace mid-cap investor Mukul Agrawal first picked up a 2.31 percent stake in the company in September 2021 when the stock was around Rs 150. Now, institutional investors are taking notice. On July 15, HDFC Mutual Fund bought a 1.59 percent stake at an average price of Rs 731. Earlier last week, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority acquired a 1.3 percent stake. Also Read | Bulk deals: Abu Dhabi Investment Authority buys 1.34% stake in House of Pearl Fashions What are the triggers for future growth, especially after such a remarkable surge in the stock price over the past three years? Firstly, the overall outlook for textile exporters is improving. Over the past year, the textiles and apparel sector has faced challenges due to ever-changing trends, higher inventory buildup in the US, and inflationary pressures across key markets like the US, the UK, and the EU. However, demand is expected to rebound as inventory levels normalize and inflation eases, potentially boosting discretionary spending and demand for clothes. The outlook for India is particularly positive. The Indian textile and apparel industry is projected to achieve a 10 percent CAGR from 2019, reaching $190 billion by 2026. Analysts at Elara Capital highlight the benefits of the China+1 strategy for Indian textiles, as consumers and manufacturers seek alternatives to China-centric sourcing. This shift is gradually reducing China's share in the global clothing trade. This is a huge plus for Pearl Global, which stands to gain significant market share due to its wide product range, multi-location manufacturing facilities, and strong customer relationships. ""It enjoys long-term relationships with global brands and retailers across geographies,"" wrote Elara Capital. Currently, India holds a 4 percent share of the global textile and apparel trade. Another positive factor is Pearl Global’s transition to an asset-light business model. The company stated in its annual report, ""We have transitioned from owning manufacturing facilities to establishing strategic partnerships with factories. This shift allows us to optimize capital utilization, enabling us to fund operations through internal resources rather than relying on external financing. Additionally, we maintain a focus on timely collections to ensure financial stability."" The company also has ambitious plans to expand its current capacities. From 82 million pieces, the firm aims to increase capacity to 120-140 million pieces by FY28, indicating a capex of Rs 450-550 crore over FY24-28. This expansion will be funded through a mix of internal accruals, debt, and growth capital. To support this, Pearl Global launched a Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) to raise funds on July 15. The exchange filing did not specify the purpose of the fundraise, but the floor price for the QIP is set at Rs 748.68 per share, a 1.5 percent discount to the previous session's closing price. Veteran investor Mukul Mahavir Agrawal holds a 3.44 percent stake in Pearl Global, according to June quarter shareholding data. A key risk for the stock would be any potential slowdown in demand for garment exports. Currently, the firm has 24 manufacturing units (including partnership facilities) spread across 5 countries. Any possible slump in the US, as certain macro indicators suggest, could dampen the positive outlook for this stock. Over the past year, the stock price has jumped over 180 percent. Despite this surge, the firm's valuations remain attractive, with a trailing twelve-month PE ratio of 20.3x, below the industry median. Not a bad deal when the Nifty trailing P/E itself is higher.

Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now NITI Aayog will release a report on July 18 that will lay down the roadmap for India to become a global hub in electronics manufacturing, underscoring the crucial role in job creation. Based on extensive analysis of the scope of India’s electronics sector and challenges ahead, NITI Aayog's comprehensive report is titled 'Electronics: Powering India’s Participation in Global Value Chains'. Global Value Chains (GVCs) It is the fragmentation of production across the world, which can lead to more jobs getting created and step up on growth. A finished product today often is an end-product of manufacturing and assembly in multiple countries, with each step adding value. Through GVCs, manufacturers can integrate the know-how of the stages of production from multiple offshore locations. This international integration of the know-how is the key feature of GVCs. Why are GVCs Important?A smart phone that gets assembled in one country might contain design elements from the US, silicon chips from Taiwan or South Korea, and rare earth metals from Africa. The final assembly ensures all countries involved in the process get to retain some value from the export of the finishes good. The World Bank regards GVCs as a powerful driver of productivity, job creation, and better living standards. The right steps can help India maximize its participation in GVCs, hence the NITI Aayog note assumes significance and will act as an indicator for the companies involved in the business. At present, India’s electronics manufacturing revolves around final assembly of electronic goods, with a very nascent ecosystem for design and component manufacturing. Brands and design companies have, however, started to outsource assembly, testing, and packaging jobs to Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS) companies in India. Some of the major listed electronics manufacturers in India include Bajaj Electricals, Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), TVS Electronics and Havells India. As per an OECD report from 2022, about 70 percent of the international trade involves global value chains (GVCs) with raw materials, parts and components crossing borders a number of times. A 2023 WTO report on GVCs noted an increase in GVC-related trade in 2021 and 2022 along with considerable growth in exports. It also noted a shortening of GVCs during periods of trade tensions between China and USA, and because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) rose 2 percent from a year earlier to Rs 42,748 crore. The company’s net profit (pre minority) for the quarter ended June 30 dropped 4.5 percent to Rs 17,445 crore, primarily due to increased depreciation expenses. RIL's oil and gas business’s EBITDA surged by 30% due to higher production volume. Operating profits for Jio Platforms Ltd and Reliance Retail Ltd rose 11.6% and 10.5%, respectively. “Consolidated EBITDA for the quarter improved from a year ago with strong contribution from Consumer and Upstream businesses offsetting weak O2C operating environment. Reliance’s resilient operating and financial performance in this quarter underscores the strength of its diverse portfolio of businesses,"" said Reliance Industries chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani. The oil-to-chemicals (O2C) segment’s EBITDA declined 14.3 percent from a year earlier to Rs 13,093 crore due to lower transportation fuel cracks and downstream chemical margins. This downturn was partially mitigated by low feedstock costs and robust domestic demand. Sequentially, O2C EBITDA fell 22 percent due to a fall in fuel cracks amid subdued demand and increased supply, although it was cushioned by improved downstream chemical margins. While energy market volatility continued to affect short-term earnings, the underlying business dynamics remained favourable. Factors such as geopolitics, weather conditions, operational outages, and new refining capacities also drove volatility. Jio Platforms Ltd’s EBITDA increased to Rs 14,638 crore. Jio’s subscriber base rose to 489.7 million, with a net addition of 8 million users during the June quarter. The company also reported 130 million 5G users. ""The digital services business registered an impressive financial performance year-on-year, continuing its positive growth momentum. Jio’s True 5G network, covering ~85% of India’s 5G capacity, continues to attract users, while the fixed broadband offerings are witnessing increasing consumer traction both in homes and enterprises,"" Ambani said. EBITDA of the oil and gas business rose to Rs 5,210 crore. The segment’s EBITDA margin stood at 84.3%. A 44 percent boost in gas production from the KG D6 field partly offset the impact of lower price realizations. The average production at KGD6 was reported at 28.7 MMSCMD of gas and approximately 21,640 barrels per day of condensate. EBITDA for RIL’s retail business rose to Rs 5,664 crore, with store area surpassing 80 million sq ft. ""Retail business delivered robust financial results, as compared to last year, well supported by all consumption baskets,"" Ambani added. RIL’s capital expenditure for the quarter stood at Rs 28,785 crore, comfortably covered by a cash profit of Rs 33,757 crore.

Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is expected to post modest quarterly earnings growth on July 19, bolstered by robust performances in its telecom and retail segments and steady oil and gas production. However, the growth may be tempered by a decline in the oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business on weaker gross refining margins (GRMs). RIL's consolidated revenue for the quarter ended June 30 is expected to rise 12.7 percent from a year earlier to Rs 2.36 lakh crore, while net profit is expected to expand by 0.6 percent to Rs 16,082 crore, according to a Moneycontrol survey. Factors driving growth Earnings growth has been driven by robust performances in RIL's consumer-facing telecom and retail businesses, while the O2C segment is expected to underperform due to weaker refining margins from a year earlier.  RIL Q1 FY25 Results Estimates ""We expect RIL to post 4 percent year on year EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) growth as consumer businesses and oil & gas production offset the decline in O2C margins,"" analysts at BOB CAPS said in a note to clients. They noted that margins across various segments are now normalising. Telecom growth: Telecom arm Reliance Jio continued to expand its subscriber base, adding as many as 9 million users in the June quarter, according to analysts. The monthly average revenue per user, or ARPU, is set to see a slight increase, contributing to quarter-on-quarter growth in revenue and EBITDA. Jio added 9 million subscribers in the year-earlier June quarter. Retail Expansion: The retail segment is anticipated to witness ongoing growth driven by increased footfalls and new store additions. EBITDA for retail is projected to grow by 16 percent from a year earlier. The previous year saw a similar trend with significant revenue growth. Also read: Howard Marks explains in latest memo why market forecasts often fail Oil & Gas Production: The upstream oil and gas segment is expected to show steady performance, with margins now normalising, BOB CAPS said. The strong performance of the oil & gas segment is seen as helping offset the decline in O2C margins. Weak O2C Performance: The O2C segment is expected to drag down overall performance due to a significant correction in GRMs, which narrowed to $3-4 per barrel in the June quarter from $7-8/bbl in the March quarter. This decline is expected to result in a 19-21 percent drop in O2C EBITDA from the preceding three months. What to watch in quarterly results Analysts will monitor the performance of RIL's O2C segment, particularly the impact of lower GRMs on profitability. Additionally, updates on subscriber additions and ARPU growth in the telecom segment, as well as footfall and store addition metrics in the retail segment, will be crucial. Investors will also be looking for any announcements related to the progress of 5G rollout and potential impacts of recent tariff hikes on future earnings.

"City gas players extend gains on hopes of tax relief for CNG, PNG","My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Shares of city gas distribution companies continue to buzz in trade, off early lows on continued hope rally over relief measures like waiver or standardisation of high VAT rates on CNG and PNG. Shares of Mahanagar Gas, IGL and Gujarat Gas all were trading higher by more than two percent in early trade on July 15. Some news reports have suggested that the Centre has kick-started the procedure to bring natural gas and ATF under the GST fold, with Finance and Oil Ministry officials having held discussions in this regard. However, CNBC-TV18 reported on July 15 citing sources that the Fitment Panel of the GST Council is yet to consider the proposal of inclusion of ATF and Natural Gas under GST. The recommendation by the Fitment Committee is essential for the GST Council to take up the matter for discussion. Moneycontrol is yet to verify this development. On Friday, CNBC-TV18 had reported citing industry sources that CGD CZplayers have sought standardisation against the difference in taxation between EVs and LPG against CNG and PNG. Demand for inclusion of CNG and PNG under the GST regime has been made in the past as well, and industry sources say CGD companies are now seeking waiver on road tax and  registration charges of CNG vehicles, in-line with EVs. City Gas Distribution players are confident that the long-standing demand of inclusion of petroleum products under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime could make some progress in the coming months. “Addressing the tax structure in this sector is imperative as natural gas, crude oil and other petroleum products remain outside the GST ambit, leading to an increasing demand for their inclusion,” said Pankaj Kalra, CEO of Essar Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Ltd (EOGEPL) told Moneycontrol. The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) too in its Budget memorandum said, “Widening the scope of GST, petroleum products, ATF, natural gas, and electricity should be subsumed under GST for providing a seamless flow of input tax credits.” “Natural gas is an environment friendly fuel, and it is desirable that import of LNG is exempted from the customs duty to enable cost effective supply of gas to major industries like fertiliser, LPG, CNG, PNG, petrochemical and power,” industry body FICCI has said. States have been resisting to cede the levies on CNG and ATF, as many rely on fuel taxes to fund crucial schemes that were promised in the manifesto. Taxes on petroleum comprise about 15 percent of states’ own tax revenue.

"Nifty likely to maintain upward trajectory till Union Budget, bet on these 3 stock picks, says Jigar Patel","My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now By Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi Once again, it was a historic week, ending July 12, for the domestic markets as the benchmark indices achieved new milestones. The Nifty 50 spot index reached a high near the 24,600 mark and closed above 24,500, marking a gain of approximately 0.73 percent from the previous week. Meanwhile, the BSE Sensex surpassed the 80,000 level and closed above 80,500. This surge in the markets was primarily driven by IT stocks, as we have highlighted in recent weeks. The Nifty index confirmed another breakout above the 24,400 level, indicating potential movement towards the 25,000 mark. However, it is important to note the strong index management at play. Previously, Reliance Industries was the driving force behind the rally, and this time, it was the IT sector. In the broader markets, the PSU space remains active and vibrant. On the data front, the foreign institutional investors (FIIs) long-short ratio in index futures reached 84 percent during the week and is now hovering around 80 percent. This trend might not be favourable for the markets in the coming weeks. It appears that the markets are determined to maintain their upward trajectory until the budget announcement in 2024. Consequently, traders are advised to focus on specific stocks and adhere to strict stop-loss strategies in their long trading positions. On the downside, only a breach of the 24,200 level might interrupt the ongoing momentum. The Nifty Bank index exhibited a sideways to negative trend throughout the week, concluding with a decline of approximately 0.72 percent. On the weekly chart, we observed the formation of several reversal candlestick patterns, signaling potential shifts in market sentiment. Looking ahead, a close below the 51,700 level could escalate the selling pressure on banking stocks, potentially dragging the index down to the 51,000 and subsequently the 50,000 levels. Conversely, if the index manages to close above the 52,800 level, we may see a resumption of upward momentum. These critical levels will be key in determining the future direction of the Nifty Bank index. Here are three buy calls for short term: MRPL | CMP: Rs 240  In recent weeks, Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals (MRPL) has been consolidating within a price range of Rs 210-230. However, the stock has recently exhibited a decisive breakout, accompanied by substantial trading volume, indicating a potentially attractive buying opportunity at this juncture. From a technical analysis perspective, the daily MACD has formed a bullish crossover just above the zero line, further signaling a positive outlook for the stock. Based on these indicators, it is advisable to consider adding long positions within the Rs 235-245 range. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 270 Stop-Loss: Rs 225 Hikal | CMP: Rs 360.45  Between March 2023 and June 2024, Hikal has been consolidating within the approximate range of Rs 260-320. Recently, the stock broke out of this range with significant trading volume, making it an attractive buy opportunity. Despite a rally of nearly 40 rupees post-breakout, it is recommended to purchase on any dips. From a technical standpoint, the daily MACD (moving average convergence divergence) has formed a bullish crossover just above the zero line, indicating a positive trend. Therefore, it is advisable to buy within the Rs 335-350 range, aiming for an upside target of Rs 425. To mitigate risk, a stop-loss should be set at Rs 315 on a daily closing basis. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 425 Stop-Loss: Rs 315 Birlasoft | CMP: Rs 732.35  Recently, Birlasoft has successfully surpassed its critical resistance level of Rs 720 and is now holding steady around the Rs 730 mark. This breakout, characterized by substantial trading volume, is a promising indicator of the stock's potential upward movement. From a technical analysis standpoint, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) has rebounded from the 50 level, suggesting renewed strength and making the current price levels especially appealing for investors. Based on these factors, it is advisable to consider purchasing shares within the Rs 720-735 range, targeting an upside potential of Rs 780. To manage risk prudently, a stop-loss should be implemented near the Rs 699 level on a daily closing basis.

"City Gas Companies seek VAT relief to stay competitive against LPG, EVs: CNBC-TV18","My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now City Gas Distribution companies (CGDs) have reported sought relief measures like waiver or standardisation of high VAT rates on CNG and PNG to stay competitive against electric vehicles and LPG. CNBC-TV18 reported citing industry sources that higher VAT rates are having a cascading effect, and mere convenience is not enough to encourage consumers to switch to PNG.

The report said ONGC is optimistic of winning an approval, according to a source who declining to be named. Earlier this year, US had reimposed sanctions on Venezuela citing that the country had broken an accord to hold free and fair elections. India and even American oil refiners had increased imports of Venezuelan oil in 2023 after a six-month waiver from sanctions was announced, which ended in April this year. Oil from Venezuela was among the cheapest for India's oil refiners, with average landed cost reported at $60.60 a barrel in January this year. The Reuters report added that ONGC has been hopeful of recovering $500 million worth of dividends pending since 2014 for the stake it holds in Venezuelan projects. ONGC has instead sought oil instead of the pending dividend, however there has not been much progress on that front so far. Crude oil has rallied this year helped by supply cuts by OPEC+, though a volatility has declined to multi-year lows in June.

Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now JSW Steel's fiscal first quarter net profit (attributable to owners) plunged 64 percent to Rs 867 crore despite lower raw material costs, amid lower volumes, weak prices due to strong competition from Chinese steel and subdued exports. The company's revenue came in at Rs 42,943 crore, up from Rs 42,213 crore in the year-ago quarter, the company said in a regulatory filing on July 19. A Moneycontrol poll of brokerages pegged net profit at Rs 921 crore, down 29 percent sequentially and 61 percent from last year. Consolidated revenue  was  estimated at Rs 44,651 crore, down 3.5 percent from the previous quarter but 5.77 percent higher from the year-ago period. On July 19, JSW Steel's shares closed trading 4.6 percent lower at Rs 888 apiece. The domestic market has seen an increased supply of the commodity, driven by a preference for cheaper import alternatives and need-based procurement.

Moreover, industrial customers booked the commodity on cheaper rates, causing ample unsold supplies. ""Steel exports fell 51.1% QoQ and 35.8% YoY to 1.49mnt. India remained a net importer of steel in Q1 FY25 similar to FY24. Elevated imports particularly from China and FTA countries pose a challenge to the domestic steel industry,"" the company said. On a standalone basis, net profit for the June quarter was Rs 1,205 crore, marking a 29 percent decline year-on-year (YoY). Total revenue from operations was flat YoY in the quarter, at Rs 32,654 crore, due to lower sales volumes. Consolidated crude steel production in the quarter stood at  6.35 million tonnes. The company spent consolidated capex of Rs Rs 4,466 crores. ""We expect consolidated capex for FY25 to be ₹20,000 crores. crore in Q4FY25,"" the company said.

"Vedanta to use Rs 8,000-crore QIP proceeds to repay Oaktree, Deutsche, Union Bank","My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Vedanta Limited plans to use the proceeds from its Rs 8,000-crore QIP offer to repay in part or full the debt it owes to Oaktree Capital, Deutsche Bank and Union Bank of India, the offer documents filed by billionaire Anil Agarwal’s company show. The floor price for the qualified institutional placement offer, which opened on July 15, has been set at Rs 461.26 a share. The primary purpose is to repay or prepay, in full or in part, certain outstanding borrowings availed by the company and one of its subsidiaries - THL Zinc Ventures Ltd, the prospectus filed by the oil and metals firm with exchanges says. A small part of the proceeds will be used for certain general corporate purposes. As of June 25, the company owed Rs 17,470 crore to Oaktree, Deutsche Bank and Union Bank of India as of June 25. Of these, Oaktree has an exposure of Rs 2,500 crore through debentures and a dollar-loan facility worth approximately Rs 7,470 crore. Vedanta owes Rs 6,400 crore to Union Bank and Rs 1,100 crore to Deutsche Bank. “The repayment/ prepayment of the borrowings by our Company and/or our Subsidiary, will help reduce our overall outstanding indebtedness, debt servicing costs, assist us in maintaining a favourable debt-equity ratio and enable better utilisation of our internal accruals for further investment in business growth and expansion,” Vedanta said in the offer document. The repayment will help improve its debt-equity ratio and enable the company to raise further resources at competitive rates and additional funds capital to fund potential business development opportunities, the company said. The QIP comes as Vedanta aims to reduce its standalone debt by $3 billion over the next three years.  Vedanta reported a reduction in net debt to Rs 56,338 crore as of March 31, down Rs 6,155 crore from the preceding three months. In June, Vedanta subsidiary Finsider International accepted a proposal from one of its banks to sell a 2.6 percent stake, worth Rs 4,379.7 crore, to a group of institutional investors.

Anil Agarwal's Vedanta seeks over a billion dollars through an upsized QIP issue,"My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Anil Agarwal-controlled mining conglomerate Vedanta has upsized its Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) to $1.02 billion, according to Bloomberg News, offering 19.32 crore shares at a floor price of Rs 440 apiece. The floor price of the share placement represents a 4.23% discount to closing price of July 15. Vedanta’s shareholders had approved on June 21 the plan to raise up to Rs 8,500 crore through issuance of securities. This strategic move is part of Vedanta’s ongoing efforts to optimize its capital structure and enhance shareholder value, reinforcing the company’s commitment to financial growth and stability, the company added. Citi, JM Financial and Nuvama Wealth are the bankers appointed for the QIP issue, CNBC-TV18 reported on July 11. QIP is a method used by publicly traded companies in India to raise funds quickly by issuing shares or convertible securities to a select group of institutional investors such as mutual funds, venture capital funds, insurance companies, and foreign institutional investors. It is an alternative to more traditional forms of capital raising, such as Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) and Follow-on Public Offerings (FPOs). The move comes as Vedanta aims to reduce its standalone debt by $3 billion over the next three years.  Vedanta reported a reduction in net debt to Rs 56,338 crore as of March 31, down Rs 6,155 crore from the preceding three months. Last month, Vedanta subsidiary Finsider International accepted a proposal from one of its banks to sell 2.6 percent shareholding worth Rs 4,379.7 crore, in the mining conglomerate to a group of reputed institutional investors. On July 16, shares of Vedanta ended lower by 0.8 percent at around Rs 456 on the NSE. The stock has gained nearly 80 percent in the year so far.

Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Motilal Oswal's research report on Hindalco Hindalco (HNDL) is undertaking a capex of ~USD6.9b (USD4.9b for Novelis and USD2b for HNDL) to expand capacities for several products across multiple locations over the next three to five years. This capex plan will augment its capacity across USA (FRP and recycling mill), Utkal (alumina debottlenecking), Aditya (can recycling and battery foil mill) and Silvassa (extrusion), among others. For FY25, the management expects to incur a capex of ~INR60b in India for: 1) mines expansion; 2) alumina refinery; 3) FRP-II expansion (battery and copper foil, copper tube, copper e-waste recycling foil); 4) smelter expansion; and 5) aluminum power work. We believe the upcoming 600kt facility at Bay Minette (Alabama, USA) will act as a proxy for the growing demand for beverage cans and auto-grade aluminum sheets in North America.

 Air India has rolled out a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) along with a voluntary separation scheme for its non-flying permanent staff ahead of the merger of Vistara with it, according to sources.

The VRS scheme is open to employees who have completed five years of service with the company while the voluntary separation scheme (VSS) has been offered to employees with less than five years of service at the airline, they said.



Air India confirmed the developments without sharing the specific details of the twin schemes that the airline rolled out on Wednesday giving the aspirants a one-month window to apply for VRS/VSS.



This is the third time Air India has come out with a voluntary retirement scheme for its permanent employees since its privatisation two-and-a-half years ago.



Tata Group took over the reins of Air India in January 2022.



Earlier this month, sources in the know had told PTI that the merger is expected to impact around 600 employees from the two airlines.



Tata Group-owned- loss-making full-service carriers -- Air India and Vistara -- together have more than 23,000 employees.



Similar schemes are expected to be announced by Vistara as well soon as after completion of the fitment exercise and assigning of roles some redundancies are bound to creep in, said a source, adding that Air India is trying to accommodate some of the redundant employees with the Air India group or within the Tata Group companies as well.



Vistara is a joint venture between Singapore Airlines and Tata Group.



Once the merger is complete, Singapore Airlines will have a 25.1 per cent stake in Air India.



The fitment exercise -- which involves the evaluation of the roles and responsibilities of staff of both airlines -- in the run-up to the merger has been going on for the past few months.



The exercise takes into account an individual's prior experience, performance and other factors.



As part of consolidating its airline business, Tata Group is also merging Air India Express and AIX Connect (formerly AirAsia India). 
 The net debt to equity ratio declined from 3 times in FY17 to less than one in FY24 
 In his message to shareholders in the annual report, Singh said the company will continue to focus on corporate governance, operational excellence and upholding the value of the company's founders.

Govt may hike exemption limit under new tax regime to Rs 5 lakh; relief unlikely for the rest,"My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now The government is looking to give the country's impressive GDP growth a consumption boost to address weaker levels of spending by the middle class. One of the ways being considered is lowering certain personal income tax rates, according to multiple government officials. The Centre is looking to increase the income limit for individuals before any tax is levied to Rs 5 lakh from Rs 3 lakh currently in the upcoming budget likely to be presented mid-July, one of the officials said. This will be applicable only to those filing returns under the new tax regime and is aimed at leaving more disposable income in the hands of individuals, particularly those in the lower earning bracket. To be sure, a final call on this will be taken closer to the presentation of the budget. If the Centre goes ahead with this move, it could lead to a reduction in tax liability by Rs 10,400 (including a 4-percent Health & Education cess) for those with incomes approximately between Rs 7.6 lakh and Rs 50 lakh. While, for those with incomes above Rs 50 lakh and up to Rs 1 crore, the benefit would be Rs 11,440 (including cess and a 10-percent surcharge), and individuals who earn more than Rs 1 crore and up to Rs 2 crore, the liability would be lower by Rs 11,960 (including cess and a 15-percent surcharge). And, finally, for those with incomes above Rs 2 crore, the benefit would be Rs 13,000 (including cess and a 25-percent surcharge). ""Increasing the basic tax exemption limit from 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh under the new tax regime will be a good move by the government. It will result in a tax savings of at least Rs 10,000, for all individual taxpayers with income above Rs 5 lakh, except for those already receiving a tax rebate on income up to Rs 7 lakhs. This change will help increase personal disposable income, stimulating spending and investment which are essential catalysts for economic growth,"" according to Sonu Iyer, Tax Partner, EY India. Akhil Chandna, Partner at Grant Thornton Bharat said that such a change in the tax slab will particularly benefit the large taxpayer class of individuals whose income exceeds the rebate limit under section 87A and who opt for the new tax regime. Budget 2020 allowed individuals to choose between the existing structure with built-in provisions for a lower tax incidence via specified investments or go in for a new system offering blanket lower tax rates while forgoing most deductions and exemptions. Under the old tax regime, a taxpayer can avail deductions against investments under certain sections as well as exemptions like house rent allowance and leave travel allowance, among others. A second official said that the Centre is unlikely to entertain a request from industry representatives to reduce the highest individual income tax slab rate under the new tax regime from 30 percent to 25 percent. ""Changes in higher income tax slabs are unlikely because consumption boost is currently needed for lower-income people,"" the official added. The government may not tinker with rates under the old tax regime either despite requests to increase the amount that attracts the highest income tax of 30 percent to Rs 20 lakh from Rs 10 lakh now. This is to ensure that more people are incentivised to move towards the new regime that discourages exemptions and rebates. Those who earn more than Rs 15 lakh a year fall under the highest 30-percent tax bracket in the new tax regime, while under the older regime the highest slab kicks in for earnings above Rs 10 lakh itself. The Centre is giving priority to potentially lower personal income tax rates rather than sharply increasing spending on subsidies and other schemes that are prone to wastage, a third official said. ""Tax rate cuts are a better way to boost consumption in the economy rather than splurging on welfare schemes given that such programmes are impacted by leakages to an extent, thereby leading to a situation where the benefit of the scheme sometimes fails to entirely reach those who need it the most,"" this official added. The topic of measures to aid consumption has come up since the country is reeling with lower levels of private consumption growth of around 4 percent, a 20-year low outside the pandemic year. This despite a world-beating GDP growth rate of 8.2 percent in FY24. (With inputs from Ashwini Sharma)   Top TrendsBudget 2024WiproStock RadarMilky Mist IPOIPO News   Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

The illusion of mutual fund NFOs: 4 myths busted,"My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now As per the Association of Mutual Funds of India (AMFI) data, the Indian mutual fund  industry collected ₹66,000 crore in FY2024 and ₹62,000 crore in FY2023 through new fund offers (NFO). Typically, a fund house launches an NFO to expand its product basket, or to catch an upcoming investment trend. Typically, there are four selling points to every NFO: --> You get a low Net Asset Value (NAV).--> You get more units.--> Exposure to new strategies.--> Diversification of your portfolio. Also read: Sector and thematic funds log record inflows in May 2024. But are they all valid? Low NAV A fund’s NAV changes depending on the performance of the underlying securities. Generally, at the time of launch of an equity fund, the NAV is ₹10. A fund that's been around for years may have a higher NAV due to the increase in value of its underlying securities. For example, the NAV of the UTI Nifty 50 Index Fund - Regular Plan - Growth Option, as on 31 May 2024 was ₹155.0260. The fund was launched on 6 March 2000 with an NAV of ₹10. The average annual returns of the fund have been around 12.10 percent over the last 24 years.  Check the NFO suitability before investing in them Thus, the fund's NAV has gone up due to its performance over decades. But a new fund has no performance history. Therefore, it may not be correct to compare the NAV of an existing fund to that of an NFO. You get more units This is correct. But does this benefit you? Here's the catch. Let's compare an existing fund with a higher NAV (₹50), in which you get fewer units, with an NFO with a lower NAV (₹10), where you get more units (because of the lower NAV). For simplicity, let's name the existing fund ‘EF’ and the NFO as ‘NF.’ Let's also assume that their portfolios are identical, for the sake of comparison. Say you invest ₹1 lakh in both, and both earn 10 percent returns. In that case, your investment in both these funds would grow to ₹1.10 lakh <see graphic>.  More than the number of units, the final amount matters Hence, despite the NF giving you 10,000 units as opposed to the EF that gave you 2,000 units, the value of your investment in each is the same. Here’s why. The value of your investment depends on two things: the number of units, and the NAV. While investing in an NFO fetches you more units, it comes at a lower price. When you multiply lower units in an existing fund with a higher NAV, the resulting amount is equal to the new fund with higher units and lower NAV. Here again, there is no real benefit of investing in an NFO just because you get more units. The value of your investment is what matters the most. Exposure to new strategies NFOs sometimes come with new strategies, offered as an add-on to your existing investment strategies. A new strategy means its performance is not yet tested. So, it could go either way — good, bad, or in between.  On the other hand, the existing strategies have a demonstrated history of performance. It is easy to make a decision based on that. Therefore, in the absence of a track record, an existing fund may be a better option to consider. Diversification NFOs are considered as an opportunity to diversify your portfolio. First of all, you need to understand the true meaning and purpose of diversification. Diversification is spreading your money among different investments to improve your risk-adjusted returns. This is done by investing in securities that behave differently in different market cycles due to their inherent nature. For example, gold prices generally move up in times of uncertainty, while the price of equities go down. This is diversifying your portfolio among different asset classes — gold and equity. Similarly, you can diversify within the same asset class also. A pharmaceutical company behaves differently from, say, a hotels or an auto company. This is diversifying your portfolio among different sectors. An existing MF scheme already diversifies your investment across different securities. If the new fund does not differ much from your existing investments, diversification may not make sense. Simply adding more funds won’t translate into diversification if the securities or strategies aren't different. Should you invest in NFOs? First, understand the purpose and benefits of an NFO. They may look tempting because of lower NAVs, higher units, and exposure to new strategies. But it's essential to analyse each claimed benefit carefully.

IiAS urges Raymond shareholders to vote against Gautam Singhania's re-election on board,"My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Proxy advisory firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS) has urged Raymond shareholders to vote against the re-election of Gautam Singhania as the Chairman and Managing Director (CMD), ahead of the firm's AGM scheduled on June 27. IiAS suggested that Raymond's board of directors remove Singhania, along with his estranged wife Nawaz Modi, from their positions until their divorce proceedings are completed. Gautam Singhania has been on the board of Raymond since April 1, 1990. The proxy advisory firm said, ""Until the time the divorce related issues are settled, and the results of an independent investigation are received, we expect the board to have both directors — Gautam Singhania and Nawaz Modi — step off the board."" Follow our live blog to catch all the market action  Singhania has faced accusation of domestic violence by estranged spouse Nawaz Modi, who also stated that he misused company funds for personal use. However, Raymond has suggested that Singhania be reappointed to the board for another five-year term. ""The board has not issued an update since their last statement in December 2023, and it is unclear if an independent investigation into these accusations has been sought,"" IiAS added. ""It is now for the shareholders to shield the company from this intra-promoter dispute."" Additionally, IiAS posed another concern: Singhania's proposed remuneration was too high for the size of the business, and was not comparable to peers. The remuneration structure from July 2024 to June 2027 is in excess of the rules imposed by the regulator, said the proxy service. According to the structure, based on the profit in the fiscal year 2024, the remuneration could come in around Rs 35 crore, or over five percent, which is over the regulatory limit. In FY24, Singhania was paid around Rs 20 crore, almost 500 times higher than the median salary of Raymond's employees. Also Read | IiAS urges independent directors to 'protect' Raymond from promoters, if needed On November 28, 2023, IiAS had urged the independent directors of Raymond to investigate the allegations against Gautam Singhania made by Nawaz Modi and ask both of them to keep off the Board during the course of the investigation. ""If need be, we expect you to protect the company from its own promoters,"" said the letter from Institutional Investor Advisory Services. Nawaz Modi accused the CMD of domestic violence and misusing company funds. ""Despite such serious and heinous accusations by one board member against another, you have been silent. Investors are worried, which is reflected in the significant erosion in stock price over the past few days. Your silence can be misconstrued – surely you don’t want stakeholders thinking that these accusations are to be tolerated,"" IiAS wrote in the scathing open letter.

Additionally, IiAS posed another concern: Singhania's proposed remuneration was too high for the size of the business, and was not comparable to peers. The remuneration structure from July 2024 to June 2027 is in excess of the rules imposed by the regulator, said the proxy service. According to the structure, based on the profit in the fiscal year 2024, the remuneration could come in around Rs 35 crore, or over five percent, which is over the regulatory limit. In FY24, Singhania was paid around Rs 20 crore, almost 500 times higher than the median salary of Raymond's employees. Also Read | IiAS urges independent directors to 'protect' Raymond from promoters, if needed On November 28, 2023, IiAS had urged the independent directors of Raymond to investigate the allegations against Gautam Singhania made by Nawaz Modi and ask both of them to keep off the Board during the course of the investigation. ""If need be, we expect you to protect the company from its own promoters,"" said the letter from Institutional Investor Advisory Services. Nawaz Modi accused the CMD of domestic violence and misusing company funds. ""Despite such serious and heinous accusations by one board member against another, you have been silent. Investors are worried, which is reflected in the significant erosion in stock price over the past few days. Your silence can be misconstrued – surely you don’t want stakeholders thinking that these accusations are to be tolerated,"" IiAS wrote in the scathing open letter.

"TISS dismisses 55 faculty members, 60 non-teaching staff across campuses due to funding issues: Report","My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now The Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) has reportedly dismissed 55 faculty members and nearly 60 non-teaching staff members across its campuses, citing a lack of funds from the Tata Education Trust, according to The Indian Express. The decision, affecting half of the teaching staff and all non-teaching personnel at its Guwahati campus, has sparked controversy and concern among the affected employees. Faculty members, who were on contractual terms, expressed dismay over the abrupt dismissal. According to sources that the paper (The Indian Express)  cited, the reason given for their termination was the non-availability of grants from the Tata Education Trust, which funded their salaries. An email from the officiating registrar's office stated that efforts to secure grant extensions had been unsuccessful, leading to the immediate cessation of their services effective June 30. Employees, some with over a decade of service, voiced frustration over the lack of notice and the abrupt nature of their dismissal. ""Our annual contracts ended in May, but we were led to believe they would be renewed pending Tata Trust funding,"" shared a faculty member from TISS Guwahati to the publication (The Indian Express). TISS administration acknowledged efforts to secure funding continuation from the Tata Education Trust over the past six months but noted the challenges in sustaining operations without timely grants. The situation has prompted the TISS Teachers Association to convene urgently, highlighting broader concerns about the institute's ability to maintain academic standards and operational continuity in the wake of such mass layoffs. TISS has indicated plans to explore hourly employment for affected faculty and to prepare for regular appointments to sustain academic programs if funding challenges persist. The institute's management has also raised the possibility of seeking alternative funding sources to mitigate the impact of the funding shortfall. In response to queries sent by the publication named above (The Indian Express), the Tata Education Trust did not provide immediate comment, directing inquiries to their public relations representatives. The abrupt dismissals have raised questions about the future of affected faculty members and the operational stability of TISS across its campuses.

Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) reported an 11.5 percent increase in revenue to Rs 2.58 lakh crore in the fiscal first quarter from a year ago, bolstered by contributions across segments. Consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) rose 2 percent from a year earlier to Rs 42,748 crore. The company’s net profit (pre minority) for the quarter ended June 30 dropped 4.5 percent to Rs 17,445 crore, primarily due to increased depreciation expenses. RIL's oil and gas business’s EBITDA surged by 30% due to higher production volume. Operating profits for Jio Platforms Ltd and Reliance Retail Ltd rose 11.6% and 10.5%, respectively. “Consolidated EBITDA for the quarter improved from a year ago with strong contribution from Consumer and Upstream businesses offsetting weak O2C operating environment. Reliance’s resilient operating and financial performance in this quarter underscores the strength of its diverse portfolio of businesses,"" said Reliance Industries chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani. The oil-to-chemicals (O2C) segment’s EBITDA declined 14.3 percent from a year earlier to Rs 13,093 crore due to lower transportation fuel cracks and downstream chemical margins. This downturn was partially mitigated by low feedstock costs and robust domestic demand. Sequentially, O2C EBITDA fell 22 percent due to a fall in fuel cracks amid subdued demand and increased supply, although it was cushioned by improved downstream chemical margins. While energy market volatility continued to affect short-term earnings, the underlying business dynamics remained favourable. Factors such as geopolitics, weather conditions, operational outages, and new refining capacities also drove volatility. Jio Platforms Ltd’s EBITDA increased to Rs 14,638 crore. Jio’s subscriber base rose to 489.7 million, with a net addition of 8 million users during the June quarter. The company also reported 130 million 5G users. ""The digital services business registered an impressive financial performance year-on-year, continuing its positive growth momentum. Jio’s True 5G network, covering ~85% of India’s 5G capacity, continues to attract users, while the fixed broadband offerings are witnessing increasing consumer traction both in homes and enterprises,"" Ambani said. EBITDA of the oil and gas business rose to Rs 5,210 crore. The segment’s EBITDA margin stood at 84.3%. A 44 percent boost in gas production from the KG D6 field partly offset the impact of lower price realizations. The average production at KGD6 was reported at 28.7 MMSCMD of gas and approximately 21,640 barrels per day of condensate. EBITDA for RIL’s retail business rose to Rs 5,664 crore, with store area surpassing 80 million sq ft. ""Retail business delivered robust financial results, as compared to last year, well supported by all consumption baskets,"" Ambani added. RIL’s capital expenditure for the quarter stood at Rs 28,785 crore, comfortably covered by a cash profit of Rs 33,757 crore.

On July 19, the shares of CrowdStrike slipped 15 percent at open on Nasdaq. At 19:15, the stock was trading 11.59 percent lower at $303.29. CrowdStrike's Falcon Sensor threat-monitoring software had sent an update, which led the Microsoft’s Windows operating system to crash. The subsequent disruption resulted in Microsoft’s Azure cloud services triggering a worldwide IT outage disrupting several businesses globally. CrowdStrike founder and CEO added that the cybersecurity firm identified the issue very quickly and started to fix it after it found that the system update that was sent had a software bug which caused an issue with the Microsoft's operating system. ""We are working with each and every customer to ensure we bring them back online"", he added. CrowdStrike founder and CEO George Kurtz said in dealing with cybersecurity, companies always try to stay one step ahead of the latest attacks from the adversaries. ""If there is a negative interaction with the way these operating systems work, in this particular case it was in Microsoft Operating System, you will see a reaction like this"", he added. ""Many of the customers are rebooting their systems, and it could be some time for some system while they recover"", Kurtz told NBC after a long night of trying to mitigate the issue. ""Software is a complex world, and staying ahead of adversaries is a tall task"", said Kurtz. IT security tools are meant to ensure that they operate in the worst-case scenario. ""To be the root cause of a global IT outage is an unmitigated disaster"", Ajay Unni, CEO of StickmanCyber, a cybersecurity company told Reuters. Shares of CrowdStrike were down close to 20 percent during pre-market trade on Wall Street this Friday.

GOLD RATE IN INDIA,"My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now One of the most precious and expensive metals, gold is considered very significant in India and is also one of the prime investment options at the present time. Not just in the form of jewellery. but gold is also valued in forms of art and coins. Despite a continuous hike in gold prices, people in India continue to invest in gold on a regular basis. Gold prices in India keep changing due to multiple factors including global market condition and the strength of the US dollar, thus leaving varying impact from city to city depending on demand and supply in local markets. If you are also planning to invest in gold, consider taking a look at the following details. Before knowing gold rates in India, it is important to know the difference between 24-carat and 22-carat gold. While 24-carat gold is a 100 percent pure form of gold with no trace of any other metal, 22-carat gold has traces of alloyed metals like silver or copper and has 91.67 percent pure gold. There are several factors that affect gold rates in India including fluctuations in the global market to the strength of the USD, import costs, interest rates on banks' fixed deposits, economic stability, seasonal prices, inflation and demand-supply, among others. While high inflation rates increase the demand for gold and vice versa, its price also shoots up as with an increase in demand. Apart from a few global conditions, the international spot price of gold also affects the metal value of gold in India. Just like any other product, demand and supply also affect gold prices. With a rise in demand and supply for gold, its prices have also increased. Even as buying gold has turned out to be a secure form of investment in India, more and more people are engaging themselves in buying gold. With gold rates skyrocketing in recent times, it is important to take note of a few things before investing in precious metals. TODAY Silver Rate Per Gram/Kg Determined by a combination of factors including international market behaviour, demand, supply and inflation, among others, gold prices in India are indicated by the Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd. and the National Commodities and Derivatives Exchange Limited (NCDEX). Factors that potentially affect gold rates in India are fluctuations in the global market, strength of the USD, import costs, interest rates on banks' fixed deposits, economic stability, seasonal prices, inflation and demand-supply. 24-carat gold is considered to be the purest form with 100 percent gold and no traces of any other metal. Auspicious festivals like Dhanteras, Makar Sankranti, Akshaya Tritiya, Dussehra, and Diwali are considered the best time to buy gold in India. It is primarily because jewellers offer a range of discounts on making charges. The purity of gold can be determined by checking the 'Hallmark' sign on the jewellery. Hallmarked jewellery certifies the claimed purity of gold and further engraves the purity level along with the name of the retailer to ensure that customers are not duped. In a bid to bring transparency into jewellery shopping, the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has been designated to implement hallmarking of gold jewellery to ensure that customers buy the purest form of gold. Through this process, the proportionate content of precious metals is determined and recorded through specific marks such as the BIS logo, the purity of the metal and a unique HUID number. To ensure that customers are not duped and sold off with an impure form of gold that has a mix of other alloyed metals, the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has been designated to implement hallmarking of gold jewellery. Beginning with the custom tax that the government imposes for importing gold into the country, it is followed by other taxes levied by sellers including the GST, making charges, and TDS. The fluctuation in the international markets largely impacts the price of gold in India. For example, any rise in the US Fed interest rate will result in money flowing into government securities and the banking system from gold reserves. India is one of the largest gold importers and sees a major impact with fluctuations in gold prices on global markets. Being the safest and profitable form of investment in India, investing in gold will not only come as an asset but is also considered superior to currency. It is one of the few assets that is tangible and creates a perception of safety among investors. Both purchasing and selling gold are very easy in India. Gold investment in India is popular and can be done through various avenues. These include purchasing gold jewelry, coins, bars, or investing in gold ETFs. Gold jewelry serves a dual purpose of adornment and investment, although factors like making charges should be considered. Gold coins and bars can be obtained from authorized dealers or banks in different weights. Alternatively, investors can opt for gold ETFs, which offer liquidity and convenience. The government also issues Sovereign Gold Bonds periodically, providing an alternative investment option. It's important to track gold prices as they are subject to fluctuations influenced by various factors. Proper storage, such as bank lockers or secure vaults, is essential for physical gold investments. Consulting with a financial advisor is recommended to make informed investment decisions based on individual financial goals and risk tolerance. Furthermore, the Gold Monetization Scheme introduced by the government allows individuals to deposit their idle gold with banks and earn interest on it. This scheme aims to put the idle gold held by households to productive use. However, it's important to note that gold investments come with risks. While gold has historically been considered a safe haven asset, its value can also fluctuate based on international market trends, currency exchange rates, and economic factors. Therefore, it's prudent to carefully monitor gold prices and assess the market conditions before making any investment decisions. Seeking guidance from a financial advisor or investment professional can provide valuable insights and help align your gold investment strategy with your overall financial goals.

From getting all the documents in order to choosing the right ITR forms, avoiding pitfalls and finally calculating as well as paying your dues, we have covered every detail needed to make the process smooth. Here is our detailed coverage on filing income tax returns for assessment year 2024-25 (financial year 2023-24). scroll down for more Salaried individuals have the luxury of switching between old and new tax regimes every year Income tax filing: In today’s digital age, using a credit card to pay income tax can provide convenience and can help manage short-term cash flow concerns. Users can also earn rewards for using credit cards which can be redeemed for spends on travel, shopping and gift cards. ITR Filing Deadline: The due date to file income tax returns for 2023-24 is July 31. Missing this deadline can result in late fees, interest, penalties and delay in refund processing. If your employer has computed your taxes under the new tax regime and you wish to claim tax deductions by switching to the old tax regime, expect queries from the I-T department on a Form 16-ITR mismatch. Also, if you do not have sufficient documentary proof to support your tax deduction claim, you should not avail of the deduction while filing your return, say tax experts.  Tax return: In the new ITR forms released earlier this year, the income tax (I-T) department sought additional details around tax deductions such as donations to political parties, disabled dependents’ PAN and Aadhaar if you are availing of deductions under section 80DD, information on high-value policies and so on. Salaried tax-payers are allowed to claim exemption on house rent allowance (HRA) paid by their employer as part of their compensation package. While the non-salaried do not get any HRA, they can avail of tax concessions under section 80GG of the Income Tax Act on rent paid. To avoid committing errors while filing your income tax returns, it's better to start the process as soon as you get access to your Form 16. Here’s a quick guide and a couple of do’s & don'ts that you can heed to As the tax season approaches, non-resident Indians (NRIs) residing in India must be looking to file their income tax returns (ITR). Understanding the process and requirements for the same is crucial to ensure compliance and avoid any penalties. Here’s a guide on how NRIs can file ITR from India Filing income-tax returns on time is important as a delay can attract fines and penalties. A delay past the deadline can also lead to rejections and re-filings.
In this video, we will talk about 5 mistakes that you should avoid while filing the ITR Income tax return: Salaried individuals can claim exemption HRA even while filing their tax returns in case they have missed out on submitting their investment declarations to their employers on time. Those who do not get HRA or are self-employed can avail of tax breaks under section 80GG on rent paid.  Choosing the right ITR form is crucial as a failure to do so could render your return ‘defective’. Also, non-disclosures will invite notices from the income tax department.  You can commence your annual income tax return filing exercise by accessing your Form 26AS, or tax credit statement, and Annual Information Statement (AIS). You need to verify the information in these documents with your bank statements and Form-16.        The due date for submitting your income tax return (ITR) for the financial year 2022-23 (assessment year 2023-24) is 31 July 2023. While the deadline may seem distant, it is advisable to commence the process as soon as taxpayers receive their Form 16. According to the regulations, employers are obligated to provide Form 16 to their employees every year on or before 15 June of the following year, immediately after the financial year in which tax deductions happened. Issuing Form 16 to taxpayers is a mandatory requirement. Filing an ITR is an annual task and is considered a responsibility of every conscientious citizen of the country. By submitting an ITR for a specific financial year, individuals have the opportunity to request a refund for any excess tax paid or deducted during that period.
     It is mandatory to file an ITR if your income exceeds the basic exemption limit. For financial year 2023-24 (assessment year 2024-25), the basic exemption limit is Rs 2.5 lakh for those below 60 years of age under the old tax regime and Rs 3 lakh under the new, minimal exemptions regime. Moreover, if you have spent more than Rs 2 lakh on foreign travel or have deposited Rs 1 crore or more in current accounts, you have to file returns even if your income does not exceed the basic exemption limit. This will depend on your sources of income. If you are a salaried individual with a total income of less than Rs 50 lakh including your pay and interest from deposits, agricultural income of up to Rs 5,000, and own only one house property—you can use ITR-1 (Sahaj). But salaried employees with incomes of over Rs 50 lakh, capital gains, investment in cryptocurrencies, unlisted shares and so on will have to choose ITR-2. For those with business income, including income from trading on stock exchanges in cash or futures and options segments, ITR-3 is the applicable form. Again, this is linked to your sources of income and the relevant ITR form. If you are a salaried individual, you will need documents such as Form-16, bank statements, capital gains statements from your broker, online mutual fund intermediaries or fund houses, among others. You must check both Form-26AS and Annual Information Statement (AIS) on the I-T e-filing portal to ensure that you do not miss out on reporting any income. This time around, the income tax department has sought additional details, particularly around deductions, through the new ITR forms released earlier this year. You will have to share the details of donations made under Section 80GGC of the Income-tax Act to political parties. For instance, apart from the contribution amount, which can be claimed as 100 percent tax deduction, you will have to disclose the break-up in the form of mode of payment, specific transaction number linked to bank transfer and so on. Likewise, tax-payers will have to provide their disabled dependants’ PAN and Aadhaar if they are availing of deductions under Section 80DD. The ITR forms also seek information on bonuses or maturity proceeds received under high-value life insurance policies (endowment policies with annual premiums of over Rs 5 lakh and unit-linked insurance plans with annual premiums of over Rs 2.5 lakh). Ensure that you select the right ITR form as using the wrong form will render your returns ‘defective’. Do not miss out on reporting any income. AIS captures all details, so it’s best to be transparent. Ensure that you make the required disclosures in schedule VDA (virtual digital assets) and CG (capital gains) if you have dabbled in cryptocurrencies or made gains or losses on stocks or mutual funds. Do not forget to disclose interest earned on savings and fixed deposits across all your bank accounts as also capital gains made through stocks, mutual funds, etc. Disclose foreign assets, including bank accounts overseas even if they have no deposits. If you own shares allotted to you by a multinational employer, you will have to use ITR-2 and disclose details under Schedule FA (foreign assets). You can claim credit on taxes paid overseas if India has a double tax avoidance agreement with the country where you have earned the income. You should file Form 67 to claim the tax credit, as skipping this step or incorrect filing could trigger I-T notices. Finally, enter the correct bank account details to ensure refunds are credited without delay. Once you submit your return online, you will have to verify it through the e-filing portal, your net banking account, demat account or Aadhaar-OTP route within 30 days. You can also download ITR-V, the acknowledgement form, and send it to the income tax department’s central processing centre (CPC) in Bengaluru. If you don’t, your return will not be taken up for processing. Yes, but the delay will burn a hole in your pocket. For FY 2023-24, you can file belated returns until December 31, 2024, but you will have to shell out a late-filing fee of Rs 5,000. However, this will be limited to Rs 1,000 if your total income is less than Rs 5 lakh.  Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd. All rights reserved.

GOLD RATE IN INDIA,"My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now One of the most precious and expensive metals, gold is considered very significant in India and is also one of the prime investment options at the present time. Not just in the form of jewellery. but gold is also valued in forms of art and coins. Despite a continuous hike in gold prices, people in India continue to invest in gold on a regular basis. Gold prices in India keep changing due to multiple factors including global market condition and the strength of the US dollar, thus leaving varying impact from city to city depending on demand and supply in local markets. If you are also planning to invest in gold, consider taking a look at the following details. Before knowing gold rates in India, it is important to know the difference between 24-carat and 22-carat gold. While 24-carat gold is a 100 percent pure form of gold with no trace of any other metal, 22-carat gold has traces of alloyed metals like silver or copper and has 91.67 percent pure gold. There are several factors that affect gold rates in India including fluctuations in the global market to the strength of the USD, import costs, interest rates on banks' fixed deposits, economic stability, seasonal prices, inflation and demand-supply, among others. While high inflation rates increase the demand for gold and vice versa, its price also shoots up as with an increase in demand. Apart from a few global conditions, the international spot price of gold also affects the metal value of gold in India. Just like any other product, demand and supply also affect gold prices. With a rise in demand and supply for gold, its prices have also increased. Even as buying gold has turned out to be a secure form of investment in India, more and more people are engaging themselves in buying gold. With gold rates skyrocketing in recent times, it is important to take note of a few things before investing in precious metals. TODAY Silver Rate Per Gram/Kg Determined by a combination of factors including international market behaviour, demand, supply and inflation, among others, gold prices in India are indicated by the Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd. and the National Commodities and Derivatives Exchange Limited (NCDEX). Factors that potentially affect gold rates in India are fluctuations in the global market, strength of the USD, import costs, interest rates on banks' fixed deposits, economic stability, seasonal prices, inflation and demand-supply. 24-carat gold is considered to be the purest form with 100 percent gold and no traces of any other metal. Auspicious festivals like Dhanteras, Makar Sankranti, Akshaya Tritiya, Dussehra, and Diwali are considered the best time to buy gold in India. It is primarily because jewellers offer a range of discounts on making charges. The purity of gold can be determined by checking the 'Hallmark' sign on the jewellery. Hallmarked jewellery certifies the claimed purity of gold and further engraves the purity level along with the name of the retailer to ensure that customers are not duped. In a bid to bring transparency into jewellery shopping, the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has been designated to implement hallmarking of gold jewellery to ensure that customers buy the purest form of gold. Through this process, the proportionate content of precious metals is determined and recorded through specific marks such as the BIS logo, the purity of the metal and a unique HUID number. To ensure that customers are not duped and sold off with an impure form of gold that has a mix of other alloyed metals, the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has been designated to implement hallmarking of gold jewellery. Beginning with the custom tax that the government imposes for importing gold into the country, it is followed by other taxes levied by sellers including the GST, making charges, and TDS. The fluctuation in the international markets largely impacts the price of gold in India. For example, any rise in the US Fed interest rate will result in money flowing into government securities and the banking system from gold reserves. India is one of the largest gold importers and sees a major impact with fluctuations in gold prices on global markets. Being the safest and profitable form of investment in India, investing in gold will not only come as an asset but is also considered superior to currency. It is one of the few assets that is tangible and creates a perception of safety among investors. Both purchasing and selling gold are very easy in India. Gold investment in India is popular and can be done through various avenues. These include purchasing gold jewelry, coins, bars, or investing in gold ETFs. Gold jewelry serves a dual purpose of adornment and investment, although factors like making charges should be considered. Gold coins and bars can be obtained from authorized dealers or banks in different weights. Alternatively, investors can opt for gold ETFs, which offer liquidity and convenience. The government also issues Sovereign Gold Bonds periodically, providing an alternative investment option. It's important to track gold prices as they are subject to fluctuations influenced by various factors. Proper storage, such as bank lockers or secure vaults, is essential for physical gold investments. Consulting with a financial advisor is recommended to make informed investment decisions based on individual financial goals and risk tolerance. Furthermore, the Gold Monetization Scheme introduced by the government allows individuals to deposit their idle gold with banks and earn interest on it. This scheme aims to put the idle gold held by households to productive use. However, it's important to note that gold investments come with risks. While gold has historically been considered a safe haven asset, its value can also fluctuate based on international market trends, currency exchange rates, and economic factors. Therefore, it's prudent to carefully monitor gold prices and assess the market conditions before making any investment decisions. Seeking guidance from a financial advisor or investment professional can provide valuable insights and help align your gold investment strategy with your overall financial goals.

SILVER RATE IN INDIA,"My Account Follow us on: co-presented by associated by Powered By  Unlock Your Trading Potential: Trade like Experts with SEBI registered creators, Learn from Courses & Webinars by India's Finest Finance Experts. Invest Now Powered By  See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Silver Prices in India: All you need to know about investment, hallmarking and imports Just like gold, silver is also among the most-purchased and preferred investment options in India. Silver is purchased in different forms including silver coins, bars, jewellery, idols, and utensils, among other items. Before investing in silver, it is important to know the current silver rate and further keep track of the market conditions. Apart from the market condition, one must also know about the factors concerning the purity of the silver, the authenticity of the seller, and the standards for determining weight. If you’re planning to invest in silver, here's what you need to know. As per the latest numbers, the silver rate in India stands at Rs 70.9 per gram and Rs 70,900 per kg. The prices are updated every day, at par with industry standards. Like gold prices, silver prices in India are also affected by a number of factors like demand, global market movement, political factors, and government policies. Demand: During festive and wedding seasons, the demand for purchasing precious metals like gold and silver rises significantly, thus leaving a major impact on their prices. Global market: While silver is considered to be a safer option for investors due to its less volatility, the global market movement also affects the price of silver in India. A drop in oil prices and the dollar usually causes a rise in silver prices. For example, if Rupee falls against the Dollar and the international prices are stable, silver is expected to become costlier inIndia. Political factors and government policies: Global political factors and a number of government policies also affect silver prices in India as any kind of change leads to a global impact, thus playing a role in silver prices. Silver rates: On the basis of international market prices, silver rates also change on a regular basis. This is why it is important to keep track of silver prices to buy them at the best rates. Making charges: Just like gold, jewellers may levy making charges on silver jewellery or cutlery. Therefore, it is important to ask directly about the applied making charges to the jewellers. Sellers: People need to research the sellers before purchasing silver to ensure that they buy genuine products with verified purity. This will not only provide them with good quality silver but will also help them to get the best resale value of silver. Certification: While buying silver, it is important to check the certification of the jewellery or the other items. Is investing in silver a bad or good idea?While the cost of silver is far lesser than gold in India, it is still a safe option for investment. Reselling silver jewellery, cutlery, coins, or bars will help get better returns, based on the current market prices. How to Differentiate Between Pure Silver and Sterling Silver?Fine silver is 99.9% pure silver and is soft in comparison to sterling silver. Sterling on the other hand is an alloy that is made mostly of silver and includes a small percentage of copper and zinc to strengthen it. While both of these look almost the same, silver is not very durable due to softness and sterling silver can last a lifetime if properly cared for. On the other hand, sterling silver is more easily tarnished than pure silver, because of the other metals in it. TODAY Gold Rate Per Gram Global market fluctuations and inappropriate or unstable demand and supply ratios can lead to an increase in silver rates, thus impacting silver prices in India. In comparison to silver jewellery, silver coins or bars are significantly heavier and more durable. Thus, buying silver coins or bars can assure a better return and resale value. One can purchase silver bars from banks, certified jewellers, and online agents in India. Customers need to note that banks usually charge higher rates, in comparison to jewellery shops because of the purity checks and assurance that they provide. Hallmarking is essential for ensuring the purity of the silver that you are purchasing. It is used as a seal of purity. Considered a purity indicator, while hallmarking is not yet mandatory for silver, getting it done will help ensure that your purchase meets certain quality standards. The best time to buy silver is during festive or wedding seasons, as jewellers often provide exciting offers and discounts on purchases. VAT and GST are usually charged on both the purchase and sale of silver in India. While there are no such regulations over the limit of owning silver in India, the government does charge certain taxes after a certain purchase limit is crossed. India is among the world’s biggest silver importers. According to a government statement, India imported nearly 245 billion Indian rupees worth of silver in FY 2022. People can opt for a number of ways to invest in silver in India. From purchasing silver jewellery to buying silver coins, and bars, and investing in the Commodity Futures Exchange, there are a lot of options. While silver jewellery is usually purchased for personal use, investments in coins and bars are often by banks and institutions for official purposes. Similarly, professional investors opt for investment in the Commodity Futures Exchange, while keeping an eye on the market.
