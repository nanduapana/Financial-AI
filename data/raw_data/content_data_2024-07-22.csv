Growth set to slow to 6.5-7% in FY25; Eco Survey asks corporates to pick the baton on job creation,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/budget/growth-set-to-slow-6-5-7-in-fy25-survey-asks-corporates-to-pick-the-baton-on-job-creation-12774569.html,general,"Gross domestic product (GDP) will likely grow at 6.5–7 percent in 2024-25, the Economic Survey 2023-2024 projected on July 22, signalling a moderation in the pace of expansion amid potential risks from cheaper imports that could affect private investment. The conservative prospects and the Survey’s flagging of headwinds in the broader economy were predicated on a possible slowing down of private investments. “A note of caution is warranted here. Private capital formation after good growth in the last three years may turn slightly more cautious because of fears of cheaper imports from countries that have excess capacity,” the Survey said. The Survey, the maiden one authored by Chief Economic Adviser V. Anantha Nageswaran, however, flagged some challenges that loomed on the immediate horizon, obliquely advising the government to steadfastly stick to the path of fiscal consolidation and not indulge in extra borrowing to fund non-merit welfare handouts. National income data released on May 31 showed India’s real or inflation-adjusted GDP grew 8.2 percent in 2023-24. The Survey, presented a day ahead of the Budget, made a strong case for investment as a key driver to sustain growth and enable a self-sustaining virtuous cycle.Follow our live blog for the latest on the Economic Survey 2024 To be sure, the government has been emphatically focused on the investment-led growth model. In the Interim Budget for 2024-25, which was presented on February 1, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman pencilled in capital expenditure of Rs 11.1 lakh crore, a growth of 11.1 percent over 2023-24. The focus on capital expenditure relies on the principle that higher public investment in infrastructure projects unleashes economic growth through multipliers. This has grown 33 percent from Rs 7.5 lakh crore in 2022-23 to Rs 10 lakh crore in 2023-24. Highways and ports are long gestation projects, but they can create jobs, with cascading benefits for intermediate industries such as cement and steel. The government’s decision to do the heavy lifting on capital expenditure appears to be a part of the well-crafted medium-term strategy to not just accelerate the pace of infrastructure project execution but also to trigger a cycle of private sector investment, or what economists sometimes describe as the “crowding in” phenomenon. The Survey exhorted the private sector to pick the “baton” from the public sector and sustain the investment momentum in the economy. “Public investment has sustained capital formation in the last several years even as the private sector shed its balance sheet blues and began investing in FY22. Now, it has to receive the baton from the public sector and sustain the investment momentum in the economy,” it said. The evidence suggests that private sector investment has been sub-par. Private sector gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) in machinery and equipment and intellectual property products has grown cumulatively by only 35 percent in the four years to 2022-23. Meanwhile, its GFCF in ‘dwellings, other buildings and structures’ has increased by 105%. This is not a healthy mix. Besides, the slow pace of investment in machinery and equipment and IP products will delay India’s quest to raise the manufacturing share of GDP, delay the improvement in India’s manufacturing competitiveness, and create only a smaller number of higher-quality formal jobs than otherwise, it said.

It holds them back, leashes their aspirations, and, in the process, holds the country back,” it said. Quoting Isha Upanishad, the CEA, in his signed foreword, was rather upfront for lesser government and authoritarian interference. “Power is a prized possession of governments. They can let go of at least some of it and enjoy the lightness it creates in both the governed and the governing.” Jobs and more Creating jobs by the millions for years on end for the armies of youth who join the queue of hopefuls every year remains a central long-term policy challenge in India. A productive job is the most powerful form of inclusion. According to the Survey the key ingredients for this strategy include a focus on policies that nourish micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to create more jobs and become more productive, reduce the cost of capital, and rationalise the risk-return trade-off for investments. The Survey squarely placed the responsibility of creating jobs with the private sector and asked profitable companies to add capacities and hire more. “It is in the enlightened self-interest of the Indian corporate sector, swimming in excess profits, to take its responsibility to create jobs seriously. Of course, it must find people with the right attitude and skills. That requires another tripartite compact - between the government, the private sector and academia,” it said. This could require appropriate policy intervention from the government to “unshackle the industry and academic institutions to play their respective roles in that mammoth task”. It cited the example of the Apprenticeship Act, which remains a work in progress, at best, in encouraging large-scale apprenticeships in the country. The New Education Policy 2020 proposes freeing India’s higher education from regulatory oversight to market oversight. “A corporate sector that helps shape the design of higher education with inputs to curriculum, evaluation standards, and faculty will pave the way for a high-quality higher education that market competition brings, replacing regulatory oversight,” it said. Also read: India needs to add 7.9 mn jobs annually till 2030, says Economic Survey 2023-24 Farm reforms The Survey made some telling observations about India’s farm sector, which, for too long, has been a tale of market distortions. Successive efforts to dismantle barriers often ran into political resistance, scuttling policy attempts at shifting the terms in favour of farmers by getting rid of unscrupulous middlemen and vested interests that distorted markets. At the core of this is the fear among farmers that they will lose their bargaining power if large corporations and private traders can enter unregulated agriculture produce markets. “A panoply of policies – by national and sub-national governments - working at cross-purposes with each other is hurting farmers’ interests…The payoff will be immense if we untie the knots that bedevil farm sector policies,” the Survey said. It advocated a “return to roots” in terms of farming practices and policymaking, which can generate higher value addition from agriculture, boost farmers’ income, create opportunities for food processing and exports and make the farm sector both “fashionable and productive for India’s urban youth”. Small is beautiful The Survey made a powerful argument for turning India’s micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) into growth engines by ironing out a few rough policy and institutional edges. “These enterprises need maximum relief from the compliance burdens they face. Laws, rules and regulations stretch their finances, abilities and bandwidth, perhaps robbing them of the will to grow,” it said. The estimated 60 million MSMEs form the lifeblood of India’s organised economy, contributing about 45 percent of the country’s GDP and employing about 110 million people.

Economic Survey 2023-24, authored by the Chief Economic Advisor, V. Anantha Nageswaran, his second one  made a definitive statement on the Indian economy, while presenting a growth  outlook of 6.5-7 percent , the survey iterated the challenges that face India today are far different from the time of China’s rise between 1980 and 2015. Highlighting the economic shocks, Nageswaran stated that bad debts in the Indian banking system and high corporate indebtedness were one of the challenges, followed by the pandemic. Highlighting a changed economic environment, the survey states that India today faces challenges from geo politics , concerns over climate change and global warming. In addition to that, “the advent of Artificial Intelligence casts a huge pall of uncertainty as to its impact on workers across all skill levels -low, semi and high. These will create barriers and hurdles to sustained high growth rates for India in the coming years and decades.” STEP UP! MESSAGE TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR On employment, the CEA states it categorically that “ in more than one respect, the action lies with the private sector. In terms of financial performance, the corporate sector has never had it so good. The results of over 33,000 companies show that , in the three years between FY 20 and FY 23, the profit before taxes of the Indian corporate sector quadrupled…hiring and compensation growth hardly kept up with it… it is in the interest of the companies to step up hiring and worker compensation. The Union Government cut taxes in September 2019 to facilitate capital formation -the CEA asks if the corporate sector has responded? Between FY 19 and FY 23, the cumulative growth in private sector non-financial Gross Fixed Capital Formation is 52 percent in current prices, during the same period, the cumulative growth in general government (which includes states) is 64 percent. “The gap does not appear to be too wide” but, the survey states, that on breaking down the data a different picture emerges. Private Sector GFCF in machinery and equipment  and intellectual property products has grown cumulatively by only 35 percent in four years to FY 23, while GFCF in ‘Dwellings, other buildings and structures ‘ has increased by 105 percent-“this is not a healthy mix,” says the CEA. Slow pace of investment in M&E and IP Products  will delay India’s quest to raise the manufacturing share of GDP , delay the improvement in India’s manufacturing competitiveness and create only a smaller number of higher-quality formal jobs.

Speculative trading has no place in a developing country like India: Economic Survey,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/f-investors-may-face-serious-losses-warns-economic-survey-12774645.html,general,"The Economic Survey has come down heavily on rising futures & options in the stock market by retail investors, using harshest words yet by a government agency, going as far to say that such speculative trading has “no place in a developing country” such as India. More importantly, it has warned the that any potential fall in stock markets could make investors feel cheated and deter them from returning to capital markets for a long time which could be detrimental to the entire economy. The Survey noted that derivatives trading, with its potential for outsized gains, often appeals to the human instinct for gambling and the allure of augmenting income. This dynamic has driven significant retail participation in derivatives trading. However, the reality of derivatives trading is starkly different from its promise. ""Globally, derivatives trading loses money for investors, for the most part,"" the survey states. The allure of quick profits can be misleading, as the majority of participants in derivatives markets end up facing losses. This underscores the importance of raising investor awareness and continuous financial education. The survey emphasizes, ""Raising investor awareness and continuous financial education is essential to warn them of the low or negative expected returns from derivatives trading."" Also read | F&O crackdown: Panel suggests sweeping curbs on options contracts, lot sizes The risks associated with derivatives trading are not merely theoretical. A significant stock market correction can lead to substantial losses, particularly for retail investors engaged in derivatives. These losses could provoke a strong negative behavioral response, with investors feeling ""cheated by unseen more considerable forces."" The Economic Survey warns that such experiences could deter retail investors from returning to capital markets for a long time, which would be detrimental to both their financial well-being and the broader economy. The Economic Survey also provides a broader context for understanding the potential pitfalls of rapid financialisation. It points to historical precedents, noting, ""The financialisation of economies has not ended well, even for advanced economies. The global financial crisis of 2008 is an obvious example."" For developing countries, the risks are even more pronounced. The survey cites the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98, which severely impacted the high-flying economies of the region. These examples illustrate the dangers when financial market innovations and growth outpace economic growth. Also read | F&O frenzy in equities now turning into a stampede, warns Vijay Kedia For India, the survey advocates for a cautious approach: ""India needs to have an orderly and gradual evolution of the financial market."" Such an approach is essential to avoid the destabilizing effects that have plagued other economies. The survey calls on all stakeholders, including market participants, market infrastructure institutions, regulators, and the government, to ensure that capital markets fulfill their fundamental role of directing savings to productive investments. This is not only a matter of national interest but also of self-interest. The survey concludes, ""All stakeholders must ensure that capital markets play their theoretically assigned role of directing savings to their most productive investments. It is not just in the national interest. It is an act of self-interest, too."" Earlier this month, Moneycontrol reported that a SEBI working committee on F&O has proposed measures to curb the rapid growth in derivatives volume. These include increasing the minimum lot size of derivative contracts to Rs 20 lakh-Rs 30 lakh from the current Rs 5 lakh, restricting weekly options to one expiry per stock exchange per week, and limiting the number of strike prices for options contracts. Last week, SEBI chairperson Buch said that the worry for the regulator is now not just from a “micro level” of the F&O trading putting investors at risk, but also from a “macro level” of it disrupting economic growth. Buch said that turnover in index options in premium terms has gone up from Rs 4.5 lakh crore in 2018 to Rs 140 lakh crore in 2024. While overall turnover in the derivatives segment has gone up from Rs 210 lakh crore in 2018 to Rs 500 lakh crore in 2024.

Fertiliser stocks surge up to 13% a day before Budget on hopes of rural focus,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/fertiliser-surge-subsidy-union-budget-12774354.html,general,"Fertiliser stocks were buzzing in trade, surging as much as 13 percent, in the run-up to the Union Budget 2024 due to be tabled by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 23. The spike in fertiliser stocks came as investors speculate the quantum of subsidy that could be allotted to the sector in the upcoming budget. The interim budget had estimated the fertiliser subsidy requirement for FY25 at Rs 1.64 lakh crore, which is lower than Rs 1.89 lakh crore for FY24. While the Street is not anticipating an increase in the subsidy bill, industry participants are expecting the finance minister may retain the previously estimated subsidy allocation. ""While the budgeted amount is considered to be adequate for FY25 due to moderation in input costs and prices of finished products, the reduced subsidy bill (as compared to FY24) will enable the government to allocate funds to more productive areas,"" Axis Securities wrote in a note. Brokerage expects the government to increase funding towards reducing dependence on fertiliser imports and developing new capabilities such as nano urea. Follow our live blog for all the updates Experts are anticipating greater emphasis on boosting rural consumption, primarily through higher spending on government’s flagship programmes. A rebound in rural consumption should benefit fertiliser companies, as it would likely lead to increased spending by farmers on crop protection. Riding high on these expectations, shares of Deepak Fertilisers, Chambal Fertilisers and Chemicals, National Fertilizers, Gujarat State Fertilizers, Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore (FACT),  and Coromandel International were trading 3-13 percent on the NSE. Fertiliser companies faced disappointing earnings in FY24 due to weak prices, subdued demand, and an influx of low-cost Chinese supplies into the global market. This led to a significant decline in profitability, straining both net profit and revenue of major players. However, signs of recovery have emerged in recent quarters, with expectations of a resurgence in demand in the latter half of the current fiscal, coinciding with the sowing of Rabi crop. In this backdrop, the fertilizer industry is relying on hopes of the government's support to stage a strong rebound later this fiscal.

Focusing on FDI from China a better way to boost India's exports to US: Economic Survey 2024,https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/focusing-on-fdi-from-china-a-better-way-to-boost-indias-exports-to-us-article-12774640.html,general,"Opting for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) as a strategy to leverage the China plus one approach will be more beneficial than depending solely on trade. This is due to China being India's leading import partner and the increasing trade deficit with China. “As the US and Europe move their immediate sourcing away from China, it is more effective for Chinese companies to invest in India and export products to these markets directly. This approach is preferable to importing from China, adding minimal value, and re-exporting,” the Economic Survey 2023-2024, tabled on July 22, said. Countries such as Mexico, Vietnam, Taiwan and Korea were direct beneficiaries of the US’s trade diversion from China. Even while these nations increased their share of exports to the US, they also displayed a concomitant rise in Chinese FDI. “Therefore, the world cannot completely look past China, even as it pursues China plus one. India faces two choices to benefit from China plus one strategy: it can integrate into China's supply chain or promote FDI from China. Among these choices, focusing on FDI from China seems more promising for boosting India's exports to the US, similar to how East Asian economies did in the past,” the survey added. Follow our live blog for the latest on the Economic Survey 2024 There has been a significant shift in global manufacturing in the last five years. Major multinational companies, including Apple, want to reduce their reliance on China, traditionally known as the ""world's factory."" This is due to disruptions caused by COVID-19, growing tensions between the US and China, and rising costs of doing business in China. As a result, several companies have adopted a 'China plus one strategy' to reduce their risk exposure to China. The survey highlighted a study by the Boston Consulting Group, which revealed that over 90 percent of manufacturers in North America moved some or all of their production to other countries like Mexico, Thailand, and Vietnam, suggesting a move away from China. The survey said that India's appeal lies in its large domestic consumer market, which makes it attractive for companies to set up operations there. In the electronics sector, there is a focus on smartphone manufacturing and assembly. The government's PLI scheme, including tax breaks and subsidies, significantly attracts companies. The rise in India's domestic smartphone demand is also a key factor in companies' investing decisions. Also read: Economic Survey pegs FY25 GDP growth at 6.5-7% For instance, Apple assembled $14 billion worth of iPhones in India during FY24, constituting 14 percent of its global iPhone production. Foxconn has started production of Apple mobile phones in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.While India may not be an immediate beneficiary of the trade diversion from China, it has witnessed a substantial increase in its electronic exports over time. Implementing the PLI scheme has been a key driver of this growth. India's electronic exports to the US have transitioned from a trade deficit of $0.6 billion in FY17 to a trade surplus of $8.7 billion in FY24, underscoring a significant increase in value addition. Within the electronics sector, the category that has experienced the most growth is mobile phones, with exports to the US rising from $2.2 billion in FY23 to $5.7 billion in FY24. “As India looks to deepen its involvement in Global Value Chains (GVCs), it will look to the successes and strategies of East Asian economies. These economies have typically pursued two main strategies: reducing trade costs and facilitating foreign investment,” as per the survey. Given that GVCs are designed to minimise costs, countries like Malaysia, Vietnam, and Taiwan have focused on lowering their trade costs over time. For India, improving logistical efficiency has been a key focus. The second strategy, focused on investment facilitation, includes actions to increase and stabilise foreign investment. “The PLI scheme, for example, encourages high-quality foreign investment by offering a market-linked incentive system for companies to comply with. Over the medium term, India is focusing on integrating its value chain with that of the West, particularly in sectors like renewable energy and advanced technology, including artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and next-generation telecommunications,” the survey said.

Economic Survey 2024: Financial system stress indicator improves as govt debt market stress eases,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economic-survey-2024-financial-system-stress-indicator-improves-as-govt-debt-market-stress-eases-12774630.html,general,"The overall improvement in the financial system stress indicator (FSSI) came on the back of an easing in government debt market stress, according to the Economic Survey for fiscal 2023-24. This was aided by a fall in long-term yields as well as volatility and higher net foreign portfolio debt inflows. The FSSI monitors the aggregate stress level in the Indian financial system. It aims to (a) help identify periods of stress, (b) assess the intensity and duration of stress in the financial system, and (c) gauge the ability of the financial markets and intermediaries to withstand shock and imbalances.

The minister (Dharmendra Pradhan) has blamed everyone but himself. I doubt he even grasps the fundamental issues at play"". He also noted, ""The issue at hand is that millions of students in the country are deeply concerned and believe that the Indian examination system is compromised. There is a widespread perception that wealth can influence and manipulate the system. This sentiment is also shared by many in the Opposition"". Further questioning the Centre's handling of alleged paper leaks in competitive exams, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav slammed the government, claiming it is setting new records for paper leaks. ""Students nationwide are protesting, investigations are revealing more, and arrests are being made. My only request is that students will not receive justice as long as this minister remains in office,"" Yadav stated. Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, responding to the allegations, stated that exam results have been released according to the Supreme Court's directions. ""I prefer not to engage in politics, but I have records of how many paper leaks occurred during Akhilesh Yadav's tenure as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh,"" he said. Pradhan said he is serving at the ""mercy of my leader"" and stated that the government is ""collectively answerable"" for the situation. The Education minister defended his position, asserting that he has the support of his constituency and does not require validation from Parliament. He condemned Gandhi's characterisation of the examination system as ""rubbish,"" calling it an unfortunate statement. He also said, ""Over the past seven years, the National Testing Agency (NTA) has conducted more than 240 exams, with over 5 crore students applying and over 4 crore participating. While there have been incidents, the current case is under the Supreme Court's scrutiny, with the Chief Justice personally overseeing the proceedings"". Besides, Pradhan also took a dig at the previous government, referencing a ""remote control"" jab often used by the BJP against the Manmohan Singh administration. ""In 2010, three education reform bills were introduced by then-Minister Kapil Sibal, one of which aimed to prohibit unfair practices. The question remains: Why was that bill withdrawn? Was it due to pressure from private medical colleges? Now, those who questioned us are raising issues"", he noted. Opposition parties in the Lok Sabha raised concerns about exam paper leaks, demanding Pradhan’s resignation and the scrapping of the NEET, prompting Speaker Om Birla to call for a constructive discussion. Birla stated that widespread criticism could harm the perception of India's education system globally. He noted that the CBI and Supreme Court are already investigating the leaks and urged for the development of a better system rather than questioning all examinations. Following Birla's remarks, Rahul Gandhi attempted to speak but was not permitted. In protest, the LoP, along with other Opposition members from TMC and DMK, walked out of the House. Congress Deputy Leader Gaurav Gogoi led slogans demanding the resignation of Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan. Following the Opposition's walkout, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi said, ""Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan should have addressed the issue directly. Instead, he spoke about the Supreme Court and PM Modi but did not clarify his actions on the matter. NEET is a crucial issue for the youth. Despite our repeated requests for parliamentary discussion, the government shows no interest. We will continue to raise this issue and pressure the government"", during an interaction with the media.

The virus is classified as a priority pathogen by the World Health Organization (WHO) due to its potential to trigger epidemics. There is no vaccine yet to prevent Nipah virus infection, neither any specific treatment for it. Health Minister Veena George informed the local media in Malayalam that the infected boy passed away on Sunday following a cardiac arrest. She further stated that the government has initiated steps to set up 25 committees to identify and isolate affected individuals as part of the Nipah virus control measures. Dr Anoop Kumar, director of critical care medicine at Aster MIMS Hospital in Calicut, mentioned that a positive case of Nipah virus was confirmed in a school boy, and individuals who had contact with him are under observation. He expressed cautious optimism, suggesting a low likelihood of an outbreak at this stage but emphasised ongoing monitoring over the next seven to 10 days. According to reports, there are 214 people identified as primary contacts of the infected boy. Isolation wards have been set up in healthcare facilities to manage potential cases, and family members of the affected patient have been placed under observation at a local hospital. Other individuals at risk have been advised to be in self-isolation at home. The government is actively tracing and monitoring potentially affected individuals to prevent the spread of the virus. Since its first appearance in Kerala in 2018, Nipah virus has been linked to several fatalities in the state.

The reform is urgent with life expectancy having risen in China to 78 years by 2021, from about 44 years in 1960, outstripping the United States, and projected to exceed 80 years by 2050. Sunday's announcement came in a key policy document that also rolled out plans to sharpen a strategy to combat a declining birth rate and an ageing population that fell for a second straight year in 2023, and is seen falling for decades. ""In line with the principle of voluntary participation with appropriate flexibility, we will advance reform to gradually raise the statutory retirement age in a prudent and orderly manner,"" the authorities said. The reforms outlined in the document are envisaged to be completed by 2029, they added. The retirement age is now 60 for men, or five to six years below that in most developed economies, while for women in white-collar work it is 55, and 50 for women who work in factories. Policymakers had said during the last two years they aimed to raise the age of retirement, but the change will be the first time that workers are able to choose to continue working. National health authorities expect the cohort of those aged 60 and older to rise from 280 million to more than 400 million by 2035, or the equivalent of the entire current populations of Britain and the United States combined.

"""Right thing to do"": Indian-Americans praise Biden's decision to drop out of 2024 Presidential race",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/right-thing-to-do-indian-americans-praise-bidens-decision-to-drop-out-of-2024-presidential-race-12774427.html,World,"Members of the Indian-American community think that US President Joe Biden did the ""right thing"" by dropping out of the presidential race. They noted that this must have been a hard decision for him to make, but he took it to put America first. 81-year-old Joe Biden announced on Sunday that he decided to give up running for re-election as president of the United States and endorsed his deputy, Kamala Harris, to be the presidential nominee of the Democratic Party. ""While I acknowledge President Biden's decision to drop out of this race, I accept that decision as his last act to preserve American exceptionalism and as an 'America First' decision,"" New York-based eminent Indian-American attorney Ravi Batra told PTI. ""Thank you, Joe Biden, for doing what must have been the hardest decision for you, and yet what every soldier on the battlefield does - give our last best measure to America,"" he said. Al Mason, prominent New York-based global real estate advisor and entrepreneur who also advises international education institutions, said that it was expected that Biden would drop out of the 2024 presidential race. ""He did the right thing. He is a good man, but he could never win against Trump. In fact Biden's endorsed candidate Kamala Harris too cannot beat Trump. She has no appeal in the battleground states,"" Mason said. Batra said Joe Biden has served the United States with distinction and his 50-year career, especially as Senate Foreign Relations chair and then as President Barack Obama's vice president are ""remarkable"". He added that the citizens of the country are at their core not Democrats or Republicans or Independents but are Americans first. Biden has done his ""finest duty by dropping out, knowing that he cannot be a standard bearer for the Democratic Party and win against"" Republican presidential nominee former US President Donald Trump who after being shot at during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, ""in a moment of extreme personal crisis had the strength of heart and mind on the stage with a face bloodied to put up his fist and say 'Fight'. ""After all, that's what all we Americans do. We fight for democracy. We fight for meritocracy, because if we don't fight it's all over. It's game over,"" Batra said. Mason said Trump is ""impossible"" to beat, even more so now with his 39-year-old Vice Presidential candidate Senator J D Vance, who has great appeal in states like Arizona, North Carolina, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Bangladesh calm a day after top court scrapped some job quotas,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/bangladesh-calm-a-day-after-top-court-scrapped-some-job-quotas-12774392.html,World,"Bangladesh appeared calm on Monday amid a curfew, but widespread disruption of telecoms prevailed a day after the Supreme Court scrapped some quotas for government jobs that sparked protests this month that killed scores. Clashes between protesters and security forces killed at least 139 people across the South Asian nation after the high court last month reinstated job reservations removed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government in 2018. On Sunday, however, the Supreme Court ordered that 93% of government jobs should be allocated on the basis of merit, against earlier quotas of 56% for groups such as families of freedom fighters, women, and people from underdeveloped areas. There were no reports of violence or protests on Monday morning and media said curfew would be relaxed for three hours in the afternoon, extended from two hours the previous day, so that people could buy essentials. Student protesters have said they plan to continue demonstrations, however, until the release of detained protest leaders, and have demanded the government lift the curfew and re-open universities shut since Wednesday. They have set a 48-hour deadline for the government to act on the demands. Last week's protests saw thousands injured as security forces fired tear gas, rubber bullets, and sound grenades to scatter the demonstrators. Experts have blamed the unrest on stagnant job growth in the private sector and high rates of youth unemployment that have made government jobs, with their regular wage hikes and other privileges, more attractive. Hasina, who was sworn in for a fourth consecutive term this year, has been accused of authoritarianism, human rights violations, and crackdowns on free speech and dissent in the past - charges her government denies.

Renault CEO Luca De Meo calls for flexibility in European EV transition timeline,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/renault-ceo-luca-de-meo-calls-for-flexibility-in-european-ev-transition-timeline-12774359.html,World,"Renault's CEO Luca De Meo expressed doubts over the timeline for transitioning to electric vehicles in Europe, adding the carmaker has to bring down costs if it wants to deliver on its EV goals, in comments to business daily Les Echos published on Monday. WHY IT'S IMPORTANT The transition to electric vehicles plays a crucial role in reducing global carbon emissions, and the pace at which this shift occurs will reshape automotive industry and the environment. Recent EU elections, coming at a time of weak electric vehicle demand, saw more and more calls to scrap the EU's 2035 ban on sales of diesel and petrol cars, which is due to be reviewed in 2026. KEY QUOTE(S) ""We need a little more flexibility in the schedule,"" De Meo, who also chairs European car lobby group ACEA, said, but added: ""However, it would be a serious strategic error to purely and simply abandon the objective because of the current market slowdown."" Asked about Renault's ambitions to shift 100% of its European car production to electric vehicles in the context of a weak domestic market, De Meo said: ""The truth is we are not yet on the right trajectory to achieve 100% electric cars by 2035. That's the truth. If customers don't follow us, we're all responsible. We need to cut costs."" CONTEXT The automotive sector has experienced various challenges, such as regulatory uncertainty and competition from China adding to a cost-of-living crisis in home markets, impacting the transition to electric vehicles. Global EV sales rose by 35% in 2023 but fell in 2024. In June, however, new car sales in the European Union rose 4.3% in June to their highest since July 2019, while registrations of battery electric cars fell marginally.

"US Presidential Polls: As Biden endorses, Kamala Harris vows to ""earn and win"" party nomination",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/us-presidential-polls-as-biden-endorses-kamala-harris-vows-to-earn-and-win-party-nomination-12774346.html,World,"Endorsed by Joe Biden to be a new Democratic presidential nominee, US Vice President Kamala Harris stated that she intends to ""earn and win"" the nomination of the party and ""do everything in my power"" to unite the nation to defeat her Republican rival Donald Trump in November. Harris, who received Biden's support to become the next Democratic presidential nominee after he withdrew from the race for the White House, is set to become the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead the ticket of a major American political party. Harris, 59, said she was ""honoured"" to receive Biden's endorsement and intends to ""earn and win"" the nomination of the Democratic Party. ""I am honoured to have the President's endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,"" she said in a statement. The historic endorsement came after Biden, 81, announced Sunday that he is dropping out of the race following weeks of disarray within the Democratic Party. Biden's disastrous first presidential debate with his Republican rival and former president Trump called into question his ability to win a second term and govern for another four years. Despite Biden's backing, it remains unclear whether Harris will become the nominee, or what process the Democratic Party would take to select an alternative. Democratic National Committee chairman Jaime Harrison said in a statement that in the coming days, the party will ""undertake a transparent and orderly process to move forward as a united Democratic Party with a candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in November."" Though Biden's endorsement almost seals her position as the presidential nominee of her party, Harris still needs to get elected by the party's delegates during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month. Biden has won 3,896 delegates as against 1,976 required to win the party's presidential nomination. In a move that would give her access to the campaign funds, the Biden-Harris campaign amended filings with the Federal Election Commission to rename its principal committee and declare Harris a candidate for president. ""I am honoured to have the President's endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,"" said Harris, who has been serving as the US' first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president since 2021. Harris immediately secured the endorsement of former president Bill Clinton, thus making it a bit easier for her to win the delegate battle during the Democratic National Convention beginning on August 19. ""On behalf of the American people, I thank Joe Biden for his extraordinary leadership as President of the United States and for his decades of service to our country,"" she said. Harris said over the past year, she has travelled across the country, talking to Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election. ""And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead. I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party -- and unite our nation-- to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda... We have 107 days until Election Day. Together, we will fight. And together, we will win,"" she said. Meanwhile, the ""overwhelming majority"" of state Democratic Party chairs have announced their support for Vice President Harris as their nominee for president, the Association of State Democratic Committees (ASDC) said in a statement on Sunday. ""I am proud that state party chairs, vice-chairs, and executive directors across the country are overwhelmingly uniting behind Vice President Kamala Harris,"" ASDC President Ken Martin said in a statement. Bill Clinton and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton quickly endorsed Harris to be the nominee. ""We've lived through many ups and downs, but nothing has made us more worried for our country than the threat posed by a second Trump term,"" they said in a joint statement. ""He has promised to be a dictator on day one, and the recent ruling by his servile Supreme Court will only embolden him to further shred the Constitution. Now is the time to support Kamala Harris and fight with everything we've got to elect her,"" the Clintons said. However, former president Barack Obama and ex-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have not yet endorsed Harris as the Democratic Party's nominee for the November 5 general elections. ""We will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead. But I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,"" Obama said in a statement. In her statement, Harris thanked Biden on behalf of the country's people for his extraordinary leadership and said, ""His remarkable legacy of accomplishment is unmatched in modern American history, surpassing the legacy of many Presidents who have served two terms in office."" ""It is a profound honour to serve as his vice president, and I am deeply grateful to the President, Dr Biden, and the entire Biden family. I first came to know President Biden through his son Beau. We were friends from our days working together as Attorneys General of our home states,"" she said. With this selfless and patriotic act, President Biden is doing what he has done throughout his life of service: putting the American people and the country above everything else, she added. Earlier, Biden announced that he has decided not to contest the presidential election. ""My fellow Democrats, I have decided not to accept the nomination and to focus all my energies on my duties as President for the remainder of my term. My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it's been the best decision I've made,"" Biden said. Such a decision from Biden comes amid a visible deterioration in his health. The president is currently in self-isolation at his Delaware residence after he tested positive with COVID-19. Biden said he will speak to the nation later this week in more detail about his decision. (With PTI Inputs)

A spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment. Inspur did not respond to requests for comment. Washington tightened its controls on exports of cutting-edge semiconductors to China in 2023, seeking to prevent breakthroughs in supercomputing that would aid China's military. Since then, Nvidia has developed three chips tailored specifically for the Chinese market.

India must play peacemaker in bloodied Bangladesh ,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/india-must-play-peacemaker-in-bloodied-bangladesh-12774075.html,World,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government can’t wash its hands of the bloodbath in Bangladesh – more than a 140 agitating young men have been already killed in the anti-quota protests rocking our neighbour – because India has a far bigger stake in Bangladesh than any other country in the whole world. Any upheaval there -- whether it leads to regime change or eventually dissipates – has grave implications for our national security. It’s therefore in our own strategic interests to sort out the mess on a war footing and restore normalcy there at any cost. It’s perfectly okay to take an official stand that the deadly turmoil in Bangladesh is its internal matter, advice Indian nationals there to steer clear of trouble and evacuate them if necessary, as our External Affairs Ministry has done in the circumstances. But India mustn’t stop at that because it is the resident power with onerous duties and responsibilities that it can shirk only at its own cost. As things stand today, New Delhi can’t afford to dither or look away. It has no option but to take charge as an elder brother, if not ‘big brother’, in its zone of influence. Hasina’s cancelled foreign trips indicate a big problem The volatility can be gauged from the fact that Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who had to cut short her state visit to China last week and return home to quell the violent protests by university students against job quotas which gathered momentum in her absence, has now been compelled to cancel her tour of Spain and Brazil to handle the increasingly dangerous state of affairs. An indefinite national curfew and shoot-on-sight order is in force, the army, paramilitary, tanks and armoured carriers are patrolling the streets, mobile internet and broadband service is shut down and all trains have been cancelled by Hasina’s Awami League administration, turning the densely populated Muslim nation at our doorstep into a ticking time bomb. Fake news for sympathy Notably, even as Bangladesh burned, mid-week there were reports of opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party leaders being closeted in the Chinese embassy in Dhaka with Beijing’s diplomats, who were joined by the Pakistani High Commissioner making it a threesome! These patently untrue stories were obviously planted in the media by Hasina’s government to gain India’s sympathies by characterising the skyrocketing turmoil as the handiwork of colluding anti-India BNP, Pakistani and Chinese saboteurs. Fortunately, New Delhi - which thoroughly monitors its backyard - has seen through all these canards. It is treating with equal disdain fabricated reports of anti-quota protestors demanding termination of India’s access to railways, roads and rivers in their country as one of the pre-conditions to call of their agitation. On Sunday, the Supreme Court scaled back the job quotas but hasn’t altogether abolished the highly discriminatory government job reservations which blatantly favour the Awami League and triggered the students’ rebellion. The judicial intervention is unlikely to restore normalcy immediately given the high number of casualties and brutalities inflicted by the army-police at Hasina’s behest which has created a chasm between the regime and ordinary Bangladeshis. India needs to counsel restraint In such a foreboding scenario, India’s task is cut out. Without wasting any time, New Delhi must counsel Hasina to control her temper and tongue after all the damage her loose talk, especially the abusive-derogatory term “Razakar”, has done. At the age of 76 and a four-term PM, she should speak like a grandmother-cum-elder statesman and not a rabble rouser hurtling the country into chaos and anarchy. Secondly, New Delhi must become the bridge between the Hasina government and protestors’ leaders so that the two sides sit across the table at the earliest. To put it bluntly, India’s mediation is the need of the hour in Bangladesh. Although India is known to be pro-Hasina, no one in Bangladesh is going to rebuff India if it comes forward as a peacemaker. Ukraine is very far away. Let’s start from our backyard where our standing is at an all-time high. India is the best third-party to end the spiral of violence and usher in peace after all the unnecessary bloodletting of the last few days. Hands-off policy is not realisitic Bangladesh is far too important for India to pursue a hands-off policy at this critical juncture. Let’s not forget that it is not just another neighbouring country like Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan or Sri Lanka – it’s a lot more than that. Geographically, Bangladesh is well and truly embedded “inside” India. Save for a short boundary with Myanmar and the waters of the Bay of Bengal in the south, Bangladesh is surrounded by as many as five Indian states – West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram – on all sides. In that sense, Bangladesh is indeed “inside” India – and therefore far more important than a neighbour in the traditional sense. Bangladesh’s domestic politics and governance naturally impact India more than any other country in the world. A Bangladesh on the boil would be disastrous for India’s restive northeast. So the faster we act, the better for us and our dear neighbour.

Trump claimed that ""everybody around Biden, including his doctors, knew that he was not capable of running for or being president."" Biden's unexpected decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race came on Sunday, accompanied by an endorsement for Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party's new nominee. This move followed weeks of intense pressure from Democrats after Biden's poor performance in a debate against Trump. Trump, using his social media platform ""Truth Social,"" suggested that Biden might not be suffering from COVID-19, as previously reported. “So we are forced to spend time and money on fighting Crooked Joe Biden, he polls badly after having a terrible debate, and quits the race. Now we have to start all over again,” Trump posted. The former president went on to question whether the Republican Party should be reimbursed for what he called ""fraud,"" suggesting that those close to Biden knew he was incapable of serving as president. “Crooked Joe just got knocked out, so now I'll have to do it a FOURTH TIME!!!” he exclaimed. Trump criticized the decision to hold the debate on ABC, advocating instead for Fox News. “Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on Fox News, rather than very biased ABC. Thank you!” he posted. In another post, Trump expressed doubt about Biden’s COVID-19 diagnosis. “Does anybody really believe that Crooked Joe had Covid? No, he wanted to get out ever since June 27, the night of the debate where he was completely obliterated.” Biden, who tested positive for COVID-19 on July 17, paused his campaign at a critical moment, returning to Delaware to isolate. Trump claimed this was an excuse to exit the race after his poor debate performance. “That was the big moment in Joe Biden's demise. That was the point in time when Joe was revealed for what he is, an incompetent man who should never have been President. Joe Biden is not fit to serve - He is destroying our Country!” Trump further criticized Biden's presidency, blaming him for issues ranging from border security to national and international standing. “Crooked Joe Biden is the worst president, by far, in the history of our nation. He has done everything possible to destroy our country, from our southern border to energy dominance, national security, international standing, and so much more,” Trump said. He accused Biden's team of misleading Americans about the president's health and capabilities. “He was annihilated in an earth-shattering debate and now the corrupt and radical Democrats are throwing him overboard. He was not fit to serve from the very beginning, but the people around him lied to America about his complete and total mental, physical, and cognitive demise. Whoever the Left puts up now will just be more of the same. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” In closing, Trump reiterated his belief that Biden's presidency has caused significant harm to the country, but expressed confidence that this damage could be quickly remedied. “He only attained the position of President by lies, fake news, and not leaving his basement... Look what he has done to our country, with millions of people coming across our border totally unchecked and unvetted, many from prisons, mental institutions, and record numbers of terrorists. We will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly,” Trump concluded. (With inputs from PTI) ",NEGATIVE,2024-07-22

The largest digital asset recovered from earlier losses to hover around $68,300 as of 8:42 a.m. in Singapore on Monday as markets reacted to the possibility of a match-up between pro-crypto Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. The move higher is a “reflection in the market’s eyes that the Democrats under Kamala Harris cannot overtake Trump in the race for the White House and that a new dawn is emerging for Bitcoin under a pro-crypto US President,” said Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG Australia Pty.  “We expect the market to become a lot more investible under a Trump administration,” Benjamin Celermajer, co-chief investment officer at Magnet Capital, told Bloomberg News. He said he expected that tokens with “real value drivers” would perform well, citing as examples the coins linked to the Maker, Aave and Lido protocols. Trump, who has taken a notably pro-crypto turn over the last several months, is scheduled to speak at a major Bitcoin conference in Nashville on July 27. The Republican presidential candidate will also host a fundraiser on the heels of the conference, for which prospective attendees have been asked to contribute $844,600 per seat. By contrast, “what we don’t yet know is Harris’ views on crypto,” said Caroline Bowler, CEO of BTC Markets. “On something like crypto where it could end up being a make or break election subject for either of the candidates, we could see some more insights into her views in the coming weeks.” Over on X, where Elon Musk sported an avatar featuring the laser eyes often considered to be a signifier of Bitcoin enthusiasm, popular crypto accounts celebrated the burgeoning rally. Teong Hng, chief executive at crypto investment firm Satori Research, said activity in the over-the-counter options market suggested Bitcoin might revisit its all-time highs soon. Rising interest in December 2024 calls with a strike price of $100,000 suggest institutional investors are becoming more bullish. Hng said he was “expecting a strong year-end rally punctuated by a Trump win.” Bitcoin’s relatively strong performance over the past week, as calls for Biden to withdraw increased in both frequency and intensity, diverged from the weakness in stocks. Further, the “underlying momentum” behind recent inflows into Bitcoin-backed exchange-traded funds suggests we could see another tilt at $70,000,” Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Group, wrote in a note.

Her remarks came after Biden (81), in a stunning decision, on Sunday announced that he was withdrawing from the race to be the next president in 2024 and endorsed Harris, who is of both Indian and African origin, as the Democratic Party's new nominee. Biden's decision to nominate Harris (59) follows weeks of intense pressure from fellow Democrats after his disastrous presidential debate performance against his Republican rival and former US president Donald Trump last month. ""I am honoured to have the President's endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,"" said Harris, who has been serving as US' first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president since 2021. Though Biden's endorsement almost seals her position as the presidential nominee of her party, she still needs to get elected by the party's delegates during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month. Harris immediately secured the endorsement of former president Bill Clinton, thus making it a bit easier for her to win the delegate battle during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago beginning August 19. ""On behalf of the American people, I thank Joe Biden for his extraordinary leadership as President of the United States and for his decades of service to our country,"" she said. Harris said over the past year, she has travelled across the country, talking to Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election. ""And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead. I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party -- and unite our nation-- to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda... We have 107 days until Election Day. Together, we will fight. And together, we will win,"" she said. Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton quickly endorsed Harris to be the nominee. ""We've lived through many ups and downs, but nothing has made us more worried for our country than the threat posed by a second Trump term,"" they said in a joint statement. ""He has promised to be a dictator on day one, and the recent ruling by his servile Supreme Court will only embolden him to further shred the Constitution. Now is the time to support Kamala Harris and fight with everything we've got to elect her,"" the Clintons said. In her statement, Harris thanked Biden on behalf of the country's people for his extraordinary leadership and said, ""His remarkable legacy of accomplishment is unmatched in modern American history, surpassing the legacy of many Presidents who have served two terms in office."" ""It is a profound honour to serve as his vice president, and I am deeply grateful to the President, Dr Biden, and the entire Biden family. I first came to know President Biden through his son Beau. We were friends from our days working together as Attorneys General of our home states,"" she said. ""As we worked together, Beau would tell me stories about his dad. The kind of father and the kind of man he is. And the qualities Beau revered in his father are the same qualities, the same values, I have seen every single day in Joe's leadership as President: His honesty and integrity. His big heart and commitment to his faith and his family. And his love of our country and the American people,"" Harris said. With this selfless and patriotic act, President Biden is doing what he has done throughout his life of service: putting the American people and the country above everything else, she added. Earlier, Biden announced that he has decided not to contest the presidential election. ""My fellow Democrats, I have decided not to accept the nomination and to focus all my energies on my duties as President for the remainder of my term. My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it's been the best decision I've made,"" Biden said. The 81-year-old president's decision comes four months before Americans go to the polls on November 5. Such a decision from Biden comes amid a visible deterioration in his health. The president is currently in self-isolation at his Delaware residence after he tested positive with COVID-19. Biden said he will speak to the nation later this week in more detail about his decision.

However, they did not explicitly endorse Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party's nominee for the November 5 general elections. Biden, aged 81, announced his withdrawal from the presidential race following increasing pressure from Democrats, particularly after a challenging debate performance against Republican candidate Trump last month. Biden has endorsed 59-year-old Harris to succeed him as the new Democratic nominee. Although Harris's nomination as her party's presidential nominee is all but assured by Biden's support, she still needs to be chosen by the party's delegates at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago the following month. Against the 1,976 delegates needed to clinch the nomination, Biden has 3,896 delegates in his pocket. Harris was able to win the delegate fight at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago starting on August 19 because she was able to instantly get the backing of former president Bill Clinton and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. Obama, who is regarded as Harris' mentor, did not, however, support her right away. ""We will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead. But I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,"" the former president said in a statement. ""I believe that Joe Biden's vision of a generous, prosperous, and united America that provides opportunity for everyone will be on full display at the Democratic Convention in August. And I expect that every single one of us is prepared to carry that message of hope and progress forward into November and beyond,"" Obama said.Joe Biden has been one of America’s most consequential presidents, as well as a dear friend and partner to me.

For him to look at the political landscape and decide that he should pass the torch to a new nominee is surely one of the toughest in his life. But I know he wouldn't make this decision unless he believed it was right for America."" Former President Barack Obama remarked that Joe Biden's decision to withdraw from the presidential race is a testament to his love for the country and serves as a historic example of a true public servant prioritizing the interests of the American people over personal ambition. Obama suggested that future generations of leaders would do well to emulate Biden's selfless act. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, like Obama, did not immediately endorse Vice President Kamala Harris following Biden's announcement.  President Joe Biden is a patriotic American who has always put our country first.

Multiple media reports claimed that she has been advocating for an open convention of the Democratic Party. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Biden's decision to step aside in the 2024 election is ""another heroic act in a long-running series of heroic acts by Joe Biden on behalf of the American people"". He described Biden as one of the most consequential presidents in American history.

"Kamala Harris' vice president - top names include Andy Beshear, Pete Buttigieg",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/kamala-harris-vice-president-top-names-include-andy-beshear-pete-buttigieg-12774131.html,World,"U.S. President Joe Biden's decision on Sunday to drop his reelection bid and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him as the Democratic candidate leaves Harris with a major, immediate decision: whom to pick as her running mate. These are some of the top people being discussed, provided they don't seek the presidential nomination themselves, according to people familiar with internal policy discussions. ANDY BESHEAR, GOVERNOR, KENTUCKY Democratic Governor Andy Beshear has carved a successful political career in a heavily Republican state that voted for Republican Donald Trump by a margin of more than 25 percentage points in 2020. Beshear has touted his record of bringing jobs to Kentucky, supporting public education and expanding healthcare access. As governor, he has vetoed legislation banning abortions and gender-affirming care for transgender youth, although the vetoes were overridden by the Republican-dominated legislature. PETE BUTTIGIEG, U.S. SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg built a strong fan base among Democratic Party voters during his 2020 primary run against both Biden and Harris, winning the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucus. Seen as a polished defender of Biden policies, Buttigieg later endorsed Biden and was picked to join the incoming administration's Cabinet in 2021. The former South Bend, Indiana, mayor also has deep ties in Michigan, a critical state for Democrats in November. ROY COOPER, GOVERNOR, NORTH CAROLINA North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper has won praise from Democrats for his strong focus on economic development and his ability to win relatively strong approval ratings in a politically competitive state that leans Republican and voted for Republican candidate Donald Trump in both 2016 and 2020. MARK KELLY, U.S. SENATOR, ARIZONA U.S. Senator Mark Kelly is well liked among Democratic Party elites for striking a relatively moderate tone in a hotly contested state that traditionally has favored Republicans, but which Biden won in 2020. A former U.S. Navy captain and astronaut, Kelly is also the husband of former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was seriously wounded in a 2011 shooting. Gun violence is a major campaign issue for Democrats. JOSH SHAPIRO, GOVERNOR, PENNSYLVANIA Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania's governor, took office just last year but is already seen as a rising star for the party nationally. Trained as a lawyer, Shapiro served as the state's attorney general, a legal background that is similar to Harris' own as a prosecutor. He has a long history of winning elections against Republicans in a state that Democrats believe they must win to secure the election in November. J.B. PRITZKER Billionaire Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has proven a major force in the party, tapping his own financial resources linked to Hyatt Hotels to help Biden's campaign effort and to stand up the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month. While Illinois leans heavily Democratic, neighboring Wisconsin is one of the biggest prizes in the 2024 election. GRETCHEN WHITMER, GOVERNOR, MICHIGAN Governor Gretchen Whitmer has built a strong base in the closely contested state of Michigan, running on a platform of straight talk and kitchen-table issues. She attracted Biden's attention in 2020, being vetted as a possible running mate before Biden picked Harris. She was a top supporter of and spokesperson for Biden's reelection bid. A Harris-Whitmer ticket would be the first all-woman ticket for a major U.S. political party - a potential bonus in an election where women's reproductive rights are a top issue.

Explainer: US Vice President Kamala Harris' views on business issues,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/explainer-us-vice-president-kamala-harris-views-on-business-issues-12774129.html,World,"U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is potentially poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee in the November election. Here are her views and actions related to some key business topics. TECH REGULATION As California attorney general, Harris sued eBay in 2012, alleging anticompetitive hiring practices surrounding a no-poaching agreement with Intuit that led to a nearly $4 million settlement in 2014. In 2015, she compelled startup Houzz to hire a chief privacy officer after allegations that the home design app had recorded sales calls without proper notification and consent. One of her signature issues was curtailing the distribution of pornography on social media, particularly ""revenge porn,"" a practice involving the posting of explicit photos without the subject's consent. She took credit for a pressure campaign that led to Facebook, Alphabet's Google, Microsoft and others taking measures to remove certain explicit images. ""I cannot emphasize enough how leaders in technology have stepped up,"" said Harris at a news conference then. ""I'm not suggesting any of them were happy to get a call from the AG saying, ""Come in, we want to talk with you."" But they all did. They did."" BIG TECH As a candidate for California attorney general, Harris reportedly assured potential donors that she was ""a capitalist."" She has generally been seen as cozy with prominent tech executives and investors, the local industry in her home Bay Area. She attended the wedding of Sean Parker, an early Facebook executive. Her brother-in-law, Tony West, is the chief legal officer for Uber. She also accepted donations from Reid Hoffman, a prominent venture capitalist and co-founder of Linkedin, as well as billionaire John Doerr and venture capitalist Ron Conway. Big tech executives also supported her, including Sheryl Sandberg, then chief operating officer of Facebook, and Marc Benioff, the billionaire CEO of Salesforce. CLIMATE AND ENERGY Harris' climate and energy positions are similar to Biden's. But throughout her career she has made clear that clean energy and environmental justice are priorities. When Biden announced Harris as his running mate in the 2020 race, he emphasized her tough stance against big oil when she served in key roles in California,Â noting lawsuits she had launched both as San Francisco's district attorney from 2004 to 2011 and then as the state's attorney general until January 2017, when she became a U.S. senator. Last year, Harris made her debut at international climate negotiations, announcing a $3 billion commitment to the Green Climate Fund and making her first major international speech focused on climate. As vice president, Harris has also been involved in Environmental Protection Agency policy rollouts that tackled long-standing environmental justice issues, such as a multibillion-dollar program to replace lead pipes and lead paint around the country. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE As vice president, Harris has been particularly outspoken on artificial intelligence. She warned against the ""existential"" threat of AI and said it could ""endanger the very existence of humanity,"" in a November 2023 address. In meeting with tech execs like Microsoft's Satya Nadella, OpenAI's Sam Altman and Alphabet's Sundar Pichai, Harris warned that they have a ""moral"" obligation to guard against AI's possible dangers. She backed an AI executive order from Biden that seeks stronger protections for consumers, singling out AI-generated scam calls and the impacts of unlabeled AI-generated content.

Donald Trump campaign switches gears to confront a Kamala Harris challenge,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/donald-trump-campaign-switches-gears-to-confront-a-kamala-harris-challenge-12774128.html,World,"Donald Trump boasted on Sunday he would easily defeat Kamala Harris if she becomes the Democratic nominee in the Nov. 5 presidential election, but her entry would reshape a race that had appeared to be going Trump's way. Democratic President Joe Biden's sudden decision to exit the race and endorse Harris, his vice president, upended an election that was still reeling from the attempted assassination eight days ago of Trump, the Republican nominee. Sources told Reuters that Trump's campaign had for weeks been planning for Harris to be his opponent should she win her party's nomination. ""Harris will be easier to beat than Joe Biden would have been,"" Trump told CNN shortly after Biden's announcement. Trump's campaign has signaled it will tie her as tightly as possible to Biden's immigration policy, which Republicans say is to blame for millions of people crossing the southern border with Mexico illegally. The second line of attack will revolve around the economy. Public opinion polls consistently show Americans are unhappy with high food and fuel costs as well as interest rates that have made buying a home less affordable. ""She's the co-pilot of the Biden vision,"" said one Trump adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity during last week's Republican National Convention, where a unified party anointed Trump as its nominee in the White House race. ""If they want to switch to Biden 2.0 and have 'Cackling' Kamala at the top of the ticket, we're good either way,"" the adviser said, repeating an insult the campaign has been trying out for weeks focused on how the vice president laughs. Make America Great Again Inc, a super PAC backing Trump, said on Sunday it was pulling anti-Biden television ads that had been set to run in the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania and replacing them with an ad attacking Harris. The 30-second ad accuses Harris of hiding Biden's infirmity from the public, and it seeks to pin the administration's record solely on her. ""Kamala knew Joe couldn't do the job, so she did it. Look what she got done: a border invasion, runaway inflation, the American Dream dead,"" the narrator says. Trump, known for using insulting and sometimes offensive language to attack his opponents, gave supporters at a rally in Michigan on Saturday a taste of the insults he is likely to fling at Harris in the coming days. ""I call her laughing Kamala. You ever watch a laugh? She's crazy. You can tell a lot by a laugh. She's crazy. She's nuts,"" he said. ALTERED RACE The Democratic Party has yet to determine how to move forward, and there is as yet no guarantee that Harris will emerge as the party's nominee despite Biden's endorsement. Harris as the Democratic nominee would alter the race in perhaps unforeseen ways, political strategists said. A 59-year-old woman who is Black and Asian-American would fashion an entirely new dynamic with Trump, 78, offering a vivid generational and cultural split-screen. The United States has yet to elect a woman president in its 248-year history. Rodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist and longtime congressional aide, said Harris would be able to mount ""a more energetic campaign with excitement from younger voters and people of color"" after Biden struggled to energize these important Democratic Party voting blocs. A former prosecutor and California attorney general as well as a former U.S. senator, Harris would be able to use ""her years of litigation experience to effectively prosecute Trump in the court of public opinion,"" Mollineau said. Chip Felkel, a Republican strategist, cautioned that it would be a mistake for the Trump campaign to assume Harris could serve as a simple stand-in for Biden, because of her potential appeal to different parts of the electorate. Recent polls have shown Harris to be competitive with Trump. In a hypothetical head-to-head matchup, Harris and Trump were tied with 44% support each in a July 15-16 Reuters/Ipsos poll. Before Sunday, the Trump campaign had already begun discussions about how they would redeploy campaign resources should Biden drop out of the race, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter. Jeanette Hoffman, a Republican political consultant, said despite the contrasts Harris would bring to the ticket, her close ties to Biden would be a drag on her candidacy. Harris ""doesn't represent the change America is looking for,"" Hoffman said. MAGA Inc CEO Taylor Budowich said his group has commissioned opposition research on several possible Democratic candidates. ""MAGA Inc is prepared for all outcomes of a Democrat Party who has only brought chaos and failure,"" he said.

Chinese bond yields fell across the board after the rate cut announcement.

I expect more rate cuts to come after the Fed enters a rate cut cycle,"" said Zhang Zhiwei, president and chief economist of Pinpoint Asset Management. ""The fact that PBOC didn’t wait for the Fed to cut first indicates that the government recognises the downward pressure on China’s economy.""

The facility, which will be the fourth Final Assembly Line (FAL) for the single engine H125, will initially produce up to 10 helicopters annually and the capacity will be ramped up depending on the market demand, Airbus officials said. ""India is the market of the future for helicopters... at present, the market is extremely embryonic, it is very small compared to what the potential could be,"" Olivier Michalon, Executive Vice President, Global Business of Airbus Helicopters, said. The ground-breaking ceremony for the FAL is expected in October or November this year and the facility will be operational in 2026 and the delivery is anticipated to start towards the end of 2026. ""We have identified eight sites which we are currently assessing. We are still in the final assessment stage. We should be in a position to announce it shortly. ""We want to be attractive and in an ecosystem that is best suited for industrial activities, logistics, employees and of course, regulations,"" Michalon said at a briefing at Marignane last week. Marignane is the headquarters of Airbus Helicopters. For Airbus, H125 is the most-sold helicopter in India as well as the South Asia region. Airbus has projected the demand for H125 helicopters in India and neighbouring countries at 500 over the next 20 years. ""We are targeting 10 helicopters per year and as the demand picks up we can ramp up,"" Head of Airbus Helicopters in India and South Asia Sunny Guglani said at the briefing. Michalon stressed that 10 might not sound like a lot and it could be 20, 30, or 50 in some years, depending on the market demand. ""We manufacture, sell and support helicopters. Also, we manufacture, sell and support solutions. This is what we can provide. Make In India solutions,"" he said. Highlighting the success story of its narrow-body A320 aircraft, Michalon said, ""H125 is our A320"". H125 can carry up to six people. Airbus is also setting up the FAL for the C295 aircraft in Vadodara, Gujarat. There are around 350 civil and parapublic helicopters in India and South Asia (India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Maldives). Out of them, less than 250 helicopters are in service in India, as per Airbus. In India, there are about 100 Airbus helicopters, with the majority of them being H125 and 130s. There are more than 4,300 H125 helicopters flying around the world. ""The FAL in India will not only make us competitive in terms of lead time, delivery time, it will also help us address the growth of the Indian market and possibly the demand from neighbouring nations. ""This is an important, strategic decision and it will have an impact on our global footprint,"" Michalon said. A basic model of a H125 helicopter could cost around 3.2 million euros, according to a company official. In India, helicopters are used for tourism, pilgrimage, and medical services as well as by the energy sector and private entities. Once set up in India, the FAL for H125 helicopters will undertake the integration of the major component assemblies, avionics and mission systems, installation of electrical harnesses, hydraulic circuits, flight controls, dynamic components, fuel system and the engine. Besides, the FAL will do testing, qualification, and delivery of the H125 to customers in India and the region. About the Indian market, Michalon said the regulations are a bit restrictive but the company is working as if those regulations are going to lighten up a bit and the skies become more open. ""Either we wait for the skies to be fully open and then it is a big rush by all helicopter manufacturers or we demonstrate our trust and recognition potential of India and be ready to invest,"" he said. In January, Airbus and Tata Group announced a partnership to set up India's first helicopter FAL in the private sector. The facility will be set up by Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL), along with Airbus Helicopters.

According to a Moneycontrol poll of nine brokerages, Hindustan Unilever is likely to report a flat revenue growth, higher by one percent on-year at Rs 15,205 crore. Net profit is likely to come in at Rs 2,512 crore versus Rs 2,500 crore seen in the corresponding quarter last year.  Earnings estimates of analysts polled by Moneycontrol are in a narrow range, and any positive or negative surprise may trigger a sharp reaction in the stock. The most optimistic estimate sees India’s largest consumer staples firm HUL’s net profit jumping five percent on-year, but the most pessimistic projection suggests that net profit might sink five percent, such has been the divergence. Factors Impacting the Earnings HUL's revenue is likely to remain flat on account of subdued performance across categories, mainly impacted by price cuts, said Axis Securities. Volume Growth: The overall demand for HUL's products is seen muted in Q1FY25, with underlying volume growth seen in single-digits, according to brokerages. However, volumes in 75 percent of HUL’s business are growing. The FMCG major is likely to boost its volume growth in FY25 and FY26, said Motilal Oswal. Segmental Performance: Across segments, the performance is likely to vary with HUL's home care business likely growing at two percent, while beauty and personal care revenue expected to fall because of price cuts. HUL's Food portfolio, especially tea, coffee, and functional nutrition drinks, may be affected by a tough summer. Prabhudas Lilladher said, “We expect strong performance in Laundry while OOH consumption and hot beverages might be weak.” EBITDA margins: While gross margins are expected to expand in the range of 120-160 basis points, while HUL’s EBITDA margin is likely to contract by 10 basis points due to higher advertisement spends, royalty payout, and the termination of GSK consignment sale. What to Look Out For? Analysts will closely monitor demand in metro areas and tier-3 towns, the effect of raw material prices on EBITDA margins, as well as the growing competitive pressure from unorganized players.

The company won the bid quoting a mining premium of 150.05 per cent of the value of mineral despatch, which it would pay to the state. CIL will formally receive the letter of intent once it deposits performance security. Further, a composite license will be issued to CIL in a year after the company meets the formalities under the notice inviting tender timeline. The block was put for sale in the second tranche of the critical mine auction. ""CIL under its diversification portfolio won the bid. With this, CIL is poised to play a supporting role in critical minerals domestically,"" it said. The country imports about 69 per cent of its graphite needs - natural, synthetic and end-use products. Currently, the graphite mining industry has limited players, offering space for willing players to venture into this business arena. Graphite has its utility as an anode material in lithium-ion battery manufacturing due to its relatively low cost and energy density. With the electric vehicle market and energy storage systems fast gaining traction, where lithium-ion cells are used, graphite has a big market. The market size for graphite is projected to take a big leap with the absolute demand projected to shoot up at the rate of 25-27 per cent by FY35 from the current level. The PSU had earlier said it is mulling the mining of critical minerals.

Byju's founder faces reckoning as startup implodes,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/byjus-founder-faces-reckoning-as-startup-implodes-12774162.html,Companies,"Byju Raveendran, an Indian mathematics whiz who soared from teacher to startup billionaire before his education-technology company imploded this year, now faces his biggest test. The future of Raveendran's eponymous Byju's online coaching firm rests with India's courts after the county's biggest startup, once loved by global investors who valued it at $22 billion, crashed below $2 billion in valuation. The 44-year-old founder last week lost control of the company as a tribunal kick-started an insolvency process. Accused of ""financial mismanagement and compliance issues"", the son of a family of teachers from a small village in south India faces a reckoning that will test the ingenuity that made him a poster child for India's startups. His formerly high-flying company was eventually brought low when it could not pay $19 million in sponsorship dues to India's cricket federation, prompting a tribunal to suspend Byju's board and make Raveendran report to a court-appointed restructuring expert. An appeals tribunal is expected to hold a hearing on Monday on whether Byju's insolvency process should be quashed after the former billionaire argued in court his company is solvent and that insolvency could shut it down and cost the jobs of 27,000 staff, including teachers. Insolvency also would not bode well for Byju's backers, such as Dutch technology investor Prosus. Raveendran denies the allegations of mismanagement and wrongdoing at his firm, which has in recent months faced lawsuits over unpaid loans and boardroom battles with foreign investors that went public. Potential insolvency is a dramatic turn of events for an entrepreneur described by one person who has worked with him as an extremely passionate and goal-oriented person who might adopt ""an abrasive approach"" in a crisis. Raveendran presented a ""suave, nice and polished"" image, appearing to heed advice, but ""eventually there was a trust deficit"", said another executive who quit last year as a Byju's senior vice president. ""He said things are improving, don't worry, we have the money,"" the former executive said. Raveendran and a Byju's spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment. BYJU'S DOWNFALL: 'OUR FAIR SHARE OF MISTAKES' An engineer by training, he started Byju's in 2011 with physical classes after friends urged him to go into teaching. Raveendran, who aced a premier Indian management exam ""with a score of 100 percentile, not once but twice"", according to the company website, started what would become his empire with his wife Divya Gokulnath, 38, a former student of his. In education-obsessed India, Raveendran hit gold by offering online teaching programs priced from $100 to $300. He got a mammoth boost when the COVID-19 pandemic sent students indoors. At the height of his fame in 2021, he and his wife had a net worth of $4 billion, Forbes reckoned. Now all that is in tatters. Behind the reversal of Byju's meteoric success, say executives and advisers who worked with Raveendran, is that he overruled associates and expanded the business through expensive acquisitions, splurging on marketing and being slow to address problems such as sales agents adopting aggressive tactics to mis-sell courses that damaged the company's reputation. With the backing of investors like General Atlantic, Prosus and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's philanthropy venture, Raveendran spent millions on acquisitions, and the company says it has 150 million students in over 100 countries. ""While growing fast, as I've accepted multiple times, we've made our fair share of mistakes"", Raveendran told an interviewer last year at the World Economic Forum in Davos. As he battled crises, the CEO also said decisions to lay off some of its then-50,000 employees and slash branding expenses would help strengthen loss-making Byju's and turn its cashflow positive. ""Every country needs a Byju's,"" he said.

Suzuki sees India’s automobile market growing fivefold by 2047,https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/auto/suzuki-sees-indias-automobile-market-growing-fivefold-by-2047-article-12774147.html,Companies,"India’s car market is on track to reach 20 million units by 2047, helped by promising growth in battery electric vehicles, Suzuki Motor Corp. Executive Vice President Kenichi Ayukawa said. First, the goal is for Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., the Japanese carmaker’s subsidiary, to grab 50% market share by 2030, from around 40% for the fiscal year through March. “We’re confident that the Indian market will expand in the mid to long term,” Ayukawa said in an interview. The emergence of India as an economic powerhouse and its expanding middle class present a clear opportunity for the Hamamatsu-based manufacturer, which has been active in the South Asian nation since 1983 and has found success as the top-selling automaker with models such as Swift and Brezza. In order to keep its lead, Suzuki plans to introduce its first-ever EV in India, as well as in Europe, next year after exhibiting its mass production model at the upcoming auto expo in India in January, according to Ayukawa. “We’ll develop products, invest and expand our network,” Ayukawa said. A total of 4.2 million passenger vehicles were sold in India in the fiscal year ended in March, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. To put that number — and Ayukawa’s prediction — in perspective, 3.1 million passenger cars were sold in the US last year, while Europe saw 15 million in unit sales. China is the world’s largest automobile market with 26 million passenger vehicle sales, according to the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers. Although Suzuki’s planned eVX is a premium electric vehicle, the carmaker will also roll out more affordable and compact models with lighter batteries, according to Ayukawa. Suzuki is targeting 15% of its sales in India to be EVs by 2030, he added. “India faces environmental issues so I think EVs will grow to an extent,” Ayukawa said. Although people are paying more for cars more than they used to, “India remains a price-conscious market,” he added. Even so, car buyers are starting to show greater appetite for crossovers and sport-utility vehicles, according to Ayukawa. Competition is tougher in that segment because it’s a “strong area for Tata and Mahindra,” he said. Tata Motors Ltd., India’s third-biggest carmaker, has already taken the lead in with fully-electric variants of its popular Tiago and Nexon models, and expects its EV business to reach profitability by early 2026. Suzuki will focus on models that can be used for everyday needs, which will require development of new types of batteries, according to Ayukawa. In the future, Suzuki may embark on domestic production of cells in the next 5 to 10 years, he added. As for collaboration in India with Toyota Motor Corp., which forged a strategic partnership with Suzuki in 2019 through a stake of about 5%, Suzuki will likely focus on smaller cars while Toyota will take the lead on bigger models, Ayukawa said. Toyota’s EV technology will also bolster Suzuki’s product development, he added. “We will learn basic know-how from Toyota and gradually make it our own,” Ayukawa said. Suzuki also sees potential in cars powered by compressed natural gas, which is cheaper than gasoline in India, according to Ayukawa. Maruti Suzuki sold 483,000 CNG cars in the latest fiscal period, up 47% from a year earlier. Although Suzuki plans to start operating four plants that convert methane from cow manure into fuel for cars that currently run on CNG, there are challenges ahead, such as monetizing the organic fertilizer that remains after manufacturing the fuel at a large scale, Ayukawa said.

Reliance records resilient operating and financial performance for Q1; here are top 10 key highlights,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/reliance-records-resilient-operating-and-financial-performance-for-q1-here-are-top-10-key-highlights-12773442.html,Companies,"Reliance Industries, which runs businesses spanning oil, telecom, and retail, reported a resilient financial performance in the fiscal first quarter ended June 30, underscoring the strength of its diverse businesses. “Consolidated EBITDA for the quarter improved from a year ago with strong contribution from consumer and upstream businesses offsetting weak O2C (oil-to-chemical) operating environment,” Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director said. Reliance stock gained more than 20 percent year to date to close Friday’s session at Rs 3,110.3 on the NSE. Here are top 10 key highlights: 1) Bottom Line The consolidated profit for the quarter came in at Rs 17,448 crore, declining 4 percent from Rs 18,182 crore net recorded in the corresponding period of previous fiscal. Finance cost increased by 1.4 percent year-on-year to Rs 5,918 crore primarily due to higher interest rates, while depreciation rose by 15.5 percent to Rs 13,596 crore during the same period on expanded asset base across all the businesses, higher network utilisation in digital services business, higher retail store count and ramp-up in upstream production, Reliance said in the filing to exchanges. Tax expenses for the June quarter at Rs 5,786 crore fell by 5.3 percent from Rs 6,112 crore in the year earlier. 2) Top Line The Mukesh Ambani-owned company registered an 11.5 percent on-year growth in gross revenue at Rs 2,57,823 crore for the quarter, on higher oil & product prices and strong growth in oil & gas segment volumes. Steady growth in consumer businesses also contributed to increase in revenue, it said. 3) Operating Performance Consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) for the first quarter of current fiscal year 2025 stood at Rs 42,748 crore, growing 2 percent over the year-ago period, as strong contribution from oil & gas and consumer business offset weak O2C. It reported EBITDA margin for the quarter at 16.6 percent, declining from 18.1 percent in same period previous fiscal. 4) Jio Platforms Jio Platforms, which contributed 13.4 percent to its gross revenue, has started the fiscal year 2025 with profit after tax at Rs 5,698 crore in the June quarter, growing 11.7 percent over a year-ago period, with Jio becoming the largest operator globally in terms of data traffic. Further, the telecom operator continued to build on its market leadership with 33 percent YoY increase in data traffic, while the 5G business accounted for over 31 percent of Jio’s wireless data traffic. “The digital services business registered an impressive financial performance year-on-year, continuing its positive growth momentum,” Mukesh Ambani said. Consolidated revenue increased by 12.8 percent to Rs 34,548 crore during the quarter, with the total subscriber base reaching 48.97 crore (up from 44.85 crore), including 13 crore 5G users. Now, Jio is the largest 5G operator outside China. On the operating front, EBITDA jumped 11.6 percent year-on-year to Rs 14,638 crore primarily due to healthy revenue growth and operating leverage. The margin stood at 49.7 percent for the quarter, against 50.2 percent in the same period previous fiscal. Average revenue per user (ARPU) at Rs 181.7 in Q1FY25 increased from Rs 180.5 in Q1FY24, with better subscriber mix, partially offset by increasing mix of promotional 5G traffic being offered on an unlimited basis to subscribers and not charged separately. 5) Reliance Retail Mukesh Ambani said the retail business delivered robust financial results, as compared to last year, supported by all consumption baskets. Reliance Retail Ventures has registered revenue at Rs 75,615 crore during the first quarter of FY25, increasing by 8.1 percent on-year and profit at Rs 2,549 crore, a 4.6 percent growth. The segment’s EBITDA at Rs 5,664 crore for the quarter grew by 10.5% year-on-year, driven by an increase in footfalls and expansion of store footprint, streamlining of operations driving margin improvement. The margin improved by 30 bps to 8.5 percent during the same period. Reliance said the retail business expanded its store network with 331 new store openings, taking the total store count to 18,918, with footfalls growing 18.9 percent YoY to over 29.6 crore. 6) Oil-to-Chemical The O2C segment, which contributed nearly 61 percent to top line, recorded a 18.1 percent year-on-year growth in revenue at Rs 1.57 lakh crore for the quarter ended June 30, primarily due to higher product prices tracking 9 percent increase in Brent crude oil prices, and higher volumes supported by strong domestic demand. However, its EBITDA was lower by 14.3 percent YoY to Rs 13,093 crore on account of lower gasoline cracks and lower downstream chemical deltas. The margin was at 8.3 percent during the quarter, against 11.5 percent in year-ago period. “The total throughput for the June FY25 quarter increased by half a percent to 19.8 MMT, and the production meant for sale grew by 2.9 percent to 17.7 MMT compared to same period previous fiscal. 7) Oil & Gas The oil and gas segment continued its growth trajectory with higher production, offsetting lower year-on-year gas price realisations, Ambani said. The segment recorded revenue for the quarter at Rs 6,179 crore, a 33.4 percent growth over the corresponding period of last fiscal led by higher volumes partly offset by lower price realisation from KG D6 and CBM field. Reliance said the average price realised for KG D6 gas was $9.27 per MMBTU (metric million British thermal unit) in Q1FY25 against $10.81 per MMBTU in Q1FY24. The average price realised for CBM gas was $11.59 per MMBTU against $14.15 per MMBTU during the same period. The segment’s EBITDA increased by 29.8 percent to Rs 5,210 crore on higher volumes from KG D6. However, margin came in at 84.3 percent against 86.7 percent during the same period. 8) Media Business Reliance said two of the biggest viewer-interest events, IPL and General Elections, helped the media business record one of the strongest quarters for the Network18 Group in terms of consumer reach and engagement. However, revenue from operations was down by 3 percent YoY to Rs 3,141 crore due to IPL revenue being distributed across two quarters this year. The media segment posted loss at Rs 221 crore for the quarter, against profit of Rs 1 crore in year-ago period, while the EBITDA stood at Rs 3 crore against Rs 108 crore during the same period. The IPL 2024 on JioCinema set new viewership benchmarks, reaching 620 million viewers, and News18 was the most tuned-in news network during general elections and on the counting day. 9) Green Energy Reliance has made significant progress on the implementation of New Energy Giga-factories. On completion, these projects will provide India a world-class, integrated green energy ecosystem which can propel the next leg of sustainable growth, Ambani said. 10) Capital Expenditure and Debt Capital expenditure for the quarter ended June FY25 was Rs 28,785 crore, against Rs 39,645 crore in the corresponding period of previous fiscal. The cash and cash equivalents increased to Rs 1.93 lakh crore for June FY25 quarter, from Rs 1.92 lakh crore in June FY24 quarter, while the net debt during the same period dropped to Rs 1.12 lakh crore from Rs 1.26 lakh crore.

The company’s net profit (pre minority) for the quarter ended June 30 dropped 4.5 percent to Rs 17,445 crore, as EBITDA in the oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business declined. Higher depreciation and finance cost also weighed on the bottomline. “Consolidated EBITDA for the quarter improved from a year ago with strong contributions from consumer and upstream businesses offsetting the weak O2C operating environment. Reliance’s resilient operating and financial performance in this quarter underscores the strength of its diverse portfolio of businesses,"" said Reliance Industries’ Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani. RIL's oil and gas business’s EBITDA surged by 30% due to higher production volume. Operating profits for Jio Platforms Ltd and Reliance Retail Ltd rose 11.6% and 10.5%, respectively. Depreciation increased by 15.5% year-on-year to Rs 13,596 crore because of the expanded asset base across all the businesses, higher network utilization in the digital services business, higher retail store count and ramp-up in upstream production.  Finance costs increased by 1.4% year-on-year to Rs 5,918 crore, primarily due to higher interest rates, the company said. According to a Moneycontrol survey, consolidated revenue was expected to increase 12.7 percent from a year earlier to Rs 2.36 lakh crore, while net profit was expected to expand by 0.6 percent to Rs 16,082 crore. Oil and gas business The oil and gas segment’s revenue was 33.4% higher in the first quarter at Rs 6,179 crore mainly on account of higher volumes, partly offset by lower price realisation from the  KG D6 and coal bed methane (CBM) field, the company said in a press release. EBITDA of the oil and gas business rose to Rs 5,210 crore. The segment’s EBITDA margin stood at 84.3%. A 44 percent boost in gas production from the KG D6 field partly offset the impact of lower price realizations. The average production at KGD6 was reported at 28.7 MMSCMD of gas and approximately 21,640 barrels per day of condensate. The average price realised for KG D6 gas was $9.27/MMBTU in the quarter under review, as compared to $10.81/MMBTU in the same period last year. The average price realised for CBM gas was $11.59/MMBTU in Q1, lower than $14.15/MMBTU last year. O2C business RIL’s O2C segment reported growth of 18.1 percent in its revenue to Rs 1.57 lakh crore in the quarter, up from Rs 1.33 lakh crore last year. The oil-to-chemicals (O2C) segment’s EBITDA declined 14.3 percent from a year earlier to Rs 13,093 crore, due to lower transportation fuel cracks—the difference between the price of crude oil and the final product--- and downstream chemical margins. This was partially mitigated by low feedstock costs and robust domestic demand. Sequentially, O2C EBITDA fell 22 percent due to a fall in fuel cracks amid subdued demand and increased supply, although it was cushioned by improved downstream chemical margins. “Overall, energy market volatility is something that we have been seeing for various set of reasons. However, we do think that the structural business dynamics remains constructive,” Chief Financial Officer Srikanth Venkatachari told reporters in a virtual briefing. Jio Platforms Jio Platforms Ltd’s revenue from operations rose 12.8 percent from last year to Rs 29,449 crore in the quarter ended June 30. The segment’s EBITDA increased to Rs 14,638 crore. Jio’s subscriber base rose to 489.7 million, with a net addition of 8 million users during the June quarter. The company also reported 130 million 5G users. ""The digital services business registered an impressive financial performance year-on-year, continuing its positive growth momentum. Jio’s True 5G network, covering ~85% of India’s 5G capacity, continues to attract users, while the fixed broadband offerings are witnessing increasing consumer traction both in homes and enterprises,"" Ambani said. The company said average revenue per user (ARPU) was Rs 181.7 with better subscriber mix, partially offset by increasing mix of promotional 5G traffic being offered on an unlimited basis to subscribers and not charged separately. Akash M Ambani, Chairman of Reliance Jio Infocomm said, “Our new prepaid plans would foster industry innovation towards 5G and AI and drive sustainable growth. Jio with its superior network and new service propositions would further build its market leadership with a customer first approach.” Retail business Reliance’s retail business posted revenue of Rs 66,260 crore, up 6.6 percent from the last year. EBITDA for RIL’s retail business rose to Rs 5,664 crore, with store area surpassing 80 million sq ft. ""Retail business delivered robust financial results, as compared to last year, well supported by all consumption baskets,"" Ambani added. The retail unit recorded footfalls of over 296 million during  the quarter, a growth of 18.9% year-on-year, while the registered customer base grew to 316 million. RIL’s capital expenditure for the quarter stood at Rs 28,785 crore, comfortably covered by a cash profit of Rs 33,757 crore. Net debt as of June 30 stood at Rs 1.12 lakh crore, down from Rs 1.16 lakh crore as of March 31, 2024. Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

Capital Gains Tax: Why fix something that ain’t broke,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/budget/capital-gains-tax-why-fix-something-that-aint-broke-12774815.html,Economy,"By Tushar Pradhan, Director at Hxgon Partners LLP The first full budget of the third term of the BJP government and the first of the coalition government is the subject of much debate already. There are various wishlists that industry bodies, corporates and individuals have prepared and are keenly looking at the fine print at the incoming budget. While it is a full budget, as opposed to an interim budget going into the elections in February, it will also be pertinent to note that in view of only a part of the year now being covered the government may decide to keep the policy oriented and major announcements for next February. Having said that, certain headlines point to some very sensitive issues especially connected to the capital markets, that have grabbed attention lately. While much of the speculation should rightfully border around the overall growth orientation, revenue maximisation and social equity addressed in the budget as main thrusts, the more controversial issue is the one relating to capital gains tax. There is speculation that there may be a change in the rate, or the holding period to determine short or long term for investments in equity and equity related instruments. Such a change if enacted may have an outsized impact on the market as sentiment in the short term is more impactful than the actual outcome. Also read: Economic Survey pegs FY25 GDP growth at 6.5-7% It will be interesting to note the reason why differential tax rates exists between income tax rates and capital gains tax in the first place. In a country that was starved of investment from its own public, the challenge was for providing capital for its growing industrial infrastructure needs by way of incentivising longer term investments by providing a tax arbitrage. If investors are willing to put their savings to work for a longer term, they should be adequately compensated for such allocation that not only satisfies the need for capital formation without additional outlay by the government or its agencies but also provides for a healthy return for deferring the outcome to investors. The capital gains tax globally also follows a similar pattern. For example, in the US, the long-term capital gains tax rates for the 2023 and 2024 tax years are 0%, 15%, or 20% of the profit, depending on the income of the filer. Please note, lower income filers get the benefit of zero capital gains tax there. Click Here To Read All Budget Related News This debate that these tax rates confer some undeserved advantage to investors while the employed majority is paying a higher tax rate is erroneous. The twin advantages of capital formation, employment of private capital for longer term usage is a needed measure for the government to see a lighter load on itself to provide the same. The short-term capital gains tax also is set higher to discourage speculation. Having increased the LTCG from zero to 10 percent and introducing differential rates for debt mutual funds and elongating the term for defining such gains, the government has already done its bit to disincentivise such investments to a certain degree. To change this picture for the worse will be sheer folly. This kind of signaling will sour investor sentiment and the booming equity cult that has recently formed will thus die a premature death. India needs long term investments, and such investments need the support of the government. Investments are not without risk and the just reward for patience is by way of such differential rates and in the larger interest should remain as status quo. After all, don’t fix it if it ain’t broke! Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"Economic Survey shows rise in foreign tourists in India, indicates revival in tourism",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/travel/economic-survey-shows-rise-in-foreign-tourists-in-india-indicates-revival-in-tourism-12774536.html,Economy,"In the post-pandemic period, India's travel and tourism sector has shown strong signs of revival with foreign tourist arrivals (FTAs), one of the laggards in this space, showing signs of growth, the Economic Survey 2023-24 highlighted. The industry recorded over 92 lakh foreign tourist arrivals in 2023, clocking a 43.5 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase. The tourism sector in India is rapidly expanding, with India being ranked 39th in the World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Development Index (TTDI) 2024, the survey said. India earned foreign exchange receipts of over Rs 2.3 lakh crore through tourism, indicating a 65.7 percent YoY increase. India's share of foreign exchange earnings in world tourism receipts increased from 1.38 percent in 2021 to 1.58 percent in 2022. Domestic tourism When it comes to domestic tourism, 29 new sites have been identified for development under the PRASHAD (Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual Heritage Augmentation Drive) scheme which caters to the augmentation of tourism infrastructure at pilgrimage and heritage sites. Out of the total sanctioned amount of Rs 1,621.14 crore for the projects under the scheme, 62.7 percent has been disbursed, the survey added. The government has also revamped its Swadesh Darshan scheme in the form of Swadesh Darshan 2.0 with an outlay of Rs 3,800 crore. The mission aims to create a robust framework for the integrated development of tourism destinations. Under the scheme, 57 destinations across 32 state government and Union Territory administrations have been identified to date. Twenty-nine projects have been sanctioned at a total cost of Rs 644 crore. Job creation The economic survey also mentioned that India's travel and tourism (T&T) sector has been influenced by global inflationary pressures and delays in the recovery of T&T capacity, similar to other economies. However, the decline in price competitiveness since 2021 has been minimal compared to its peers, with only a 0.7 percent drop. India's decline is particularly slight at just 0.1 percent from the 2021 levels, which reflects the government’s consistent efforts to maintain stability despite the slowdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the survey said. The World Economic Forum's TTDI (Travel & Tourism Development Index) 2024 report emphasises the need for improvements in tourist services and infrastructure, and the development of a skilled workforce. In a challenging environment for employment generation in services due to the rise of AI and manufacturing due to rising protectionism, transportation costs and supply concerns, the tourism sector represents a relatively low-hanging fruit for job creation, according to the survey which added that India has to seize this opportunity. To formalise employment within this sector, the Ministry of Tourism has initiated the Incredible India Tourism Facilitator Certificate Programme. This programme aims to create a skilled cadre of tourist facilitators nationwide through a digital platform that offers online learning opportunities and certification courses, the survey added.

India to seek licences to scout Pacific Ocean for critical minerals,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/india-to-seek-licences-to-scout-pacific-ocean-for-critical-minerals-12774681.html,Economy,"India will apply for licences to explore for deep-sea minerals in the Pacific Ocean as it competes to secure supplies of minerals critical for energy transition technologies, a top government scientist told Reuters. The UN-backed International Seabed Authority (ISA) has issued 31 deep-sea exploration licences, including two for India in the Indian Ocean, but is yet to allow mining because the 36-member body is still working on regulations. The 36-member ISA council is meeting in Jamaica this month to negotiate the latest draft of a mining code. M. Ravichandran, the top scientist at India's Ministry of Earth Sciences, said his ministry will work closely with India's mining industry as it readies to apply next year for exploration of seabed minerals in the Pacific. India's critical minerals plans in the Pacific have not been previously reported. China, Russia, and some Pacific Island nations have already secured exploration licences for the Pacific Ocean. India plans to focus on the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a vast plain between Hawaii and Mexico known to hold large volumes of polymetallic nodules containing minerals used in electric vehicles and solar panels including manganese, nickel, copper, and cobalt. First discovered by British sailors in 1873, the potato-shaped nodules take millions of years to form. RESERVOIR OF MINERALS Unlike China, India lacks seabed mining expertise and will take at least three to four years before it is ready to extract minerals from the ocean's depths, experts said. ""We have done a lot of work on the deep sea mining technology but not perfected (it). In that aspect, we are not yet ready,"" said M. Rajeevan, former chief of India's Ministry of Earth Sciences. Opponents of deep-sea mining say that not enough is known about its impact on marine ecosystems. ""I am not confident that current technologies and methods can overcome the environmental concerns,"" said Pradeep Singh, an ocean governance specialist at the Research Institute for Sustainability in Potsdam, Germany. Some 27 countries have called for a moratorium or suspension of all ocean mining-related activities, but some Pacific nations including Nauru and Cook Islands favour deep-sea mining. Nauru is expected to submit a mining license application to the ISA on behalf of Canada's The Metals Company  later this year. India also expects to receive two more exploration permits from the ISA this year for the Indian Ocean, focused on the Carlsberg Ridge and Afanasy-Nikitin Seamount regions, known for polymetallic sulphide deposits and ferromanganese crusts, Ravichandran said. The permits last for 15 years, according to the ISA website.Polymetallic sulphide deposits contain metals such as copper, gold, silver and zinc. Ferromanganese crusts are known for cobalt, nickel, manganese, platinum and rare earth elements among other resources. India, which relies on imports of raw materials such as copper and lithium, has listed 24 minerals as ""critical"" for energy transition. It is also scouting for overseas mineral assets to meet its rising green energy requirements.""This is like racing,"" Ravichandran said of the urgency to seek seabed minerals.

The conservative prospects and the Survey’s flagging of headwinds in the broader economy were predicated on a possible slowing down of private investments. “A note of caution is warranted here. Private capital formation after good growth in the last three years may turn slightly more cautious because of fears of cheaper imports from countries that have excess capacity,” the Survey said. The Survey, the maiden one authored by Chief Economic Adviser V.

In the Interim Budget for 2024-25, which was presented on February 1, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman pencilled in capital expenditure of Rs 11.1 lakh crore, a growth of 11.1 percent over 2023-24. The focus on capital expenditure relies on the principle that higher public investment in infrastructure projects unleashes economic growth through multipliers. This has grown 33 percent from Rs 7.5 lakh crore in 2022-23 to Rs 10 lakh crore in 2023-24. Highways and ports are long gestation projects, but they can create jobs, with cascading benefits for intermediate industries such as cement and steel. The government’s decision to do the heavy lifting on capital expenditure appears to be a part of the well-crafted medium-term strategy to not just accelerate the pace of infrastructure project execution but also to trigger a cycle of private sector investment, or what economists sometimes describe as the “crowding in” phenomenon. The Survey exhorted the private sector to pick the “baton” from the public sector and sustain the investment momentum in the economy. “Public investment has sustained capital formation in the last several years even as the private sector shed its balance sheet blues and began investing in FY22. Now, it has to receive the baton from the public sector and sustain the investment momentum in the economy,” it said. The evidence suggests that private sector investment has been sub-par. Private sector gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) in machinery and equipment and intellectual property products has grown cumulatively by only 35 percent in the four years to 2022-23. Meanwhile, its GFCF in ‘dwellings, other buildings and structures’ has increased by 105%. This is not a healthy mix. Besides, the slow pace of investment in machinery and equipment and IP products will delay India’s quest to raise the manufacturing share of GDP, delay the improvement in India’s manufacturing competitiveness, and create only a smaller number of higher-quality formal jobs than otherwise, it said.

It holds them back, leashes their aspirations, and, in the process, holds the country back,” it said. Quoting Isha Upanishad, the CEA, in his signed foreword, was rather upfront for lesser government and authoritarian interference. “Power is a prized possession of governments. They can let go of at least some of it and enjoy the lightness it creates in both the governed and the governing.” Jobs and more Creating jobs by the millions for years on end for the armies of youth who join the queue of hopefuls every year remains a central long-term policy challenge in India. A productive job is the most powerful form of inclusion. According to the Survey the key ingredients for this strategy include a focus on policies that nourish micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to create more jobs and become more productive, reduce the cost of capital, and rationalise the risk-return trade-off for investments. The Survey squarely placed the responsibility of creating jobs with the private sector and asked profitable companies to add capacities and hire more. “It is in the enlightened self-interest of the Indian corporate sector, swimming in excess profits, to take its responsibility to create jobs seriously. Of course, it must find people with the right attitude and skills. That requires another tripartite compact - between the government, the private sector and academia,” it said. This could require appropriate policy intervention from the government to “unshackle the industry and academic institutions to play their respective roles in that mammoth task”. It cited the example of the Apprenticeship Act, which remains a work in progress, at best, in encouraging large-scale apprenticeships in the country. The New Education Policy 2020 proposes freeing India’s higher education from regulatory oversight to market oversight. “A corporate sector that helps shape the design of higher education with inputs to curriculum, evaluation standards, and faculty will pave the way for a high-quality higher education that market competition brings, replacing regulatory oversight,” it said. Also read: India needs to add 7.9 mn jobs annually till 2030, says Economic Survey 2023-24 Farm reforms The Survey made some telling observations about India’s farm sector, which, for too long, has been a tale of market distortions. Successive efforts to dismantle barriers often ran into political resistance, scuttling policy attempts at shifting the terms in favour of farmers by getting rid of unscrupulous middlemen and vested interests that distorted markets. At the core of this is the fear among farmers that they will lose their bargaining power if large corporations and private traders can enter unregulated agriculture produce markets. “A panoply of policies – by national and sub-national governments - working at cross-purposes with each other is hurting farmers’ interests…The payoff will be immense if we untie the knots that bedevil farm sector policies,” the Survey said. It advocated a “return to roots” in terms of farming practices and policymaking, which can generate higher value addition from agriculture, boost farmers’ income, create opportunities for food processing and exports and make the farm sector both “fashionable and productive for India’s urban youth”. Small is beautiful The Survey made a powerful argument for turning India’s micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) into growth engines by ironing out a few rough policy and institutional edges. “These enterprises need maximum relief from the compliance burdens they face. Laws, rules and regulations stretch their finances, abilities and bandwidth, perhaps robbing them of the will to grow,” it said. The estimated 60 million MSMEs form the lifeblood of India’s organised economy, contributing about 45 percent of the country’s GDP and employing about 110 million people.

Prioritising a stable and simple tax regime in Budget 2024 to enhance ease of doing business,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/prioritising-a-stable-and-simple-tax-regime-in-budget-2024-to-enhance-ease-of-doing-business-12774514.html,Economy,"By Gokul Chaudhri  In the World Bank’s Doing Business Report 2020, India's ranking improved significantly, jumping 79 spots from 2014 to reach 63rd out of 190 countries. This progress underscores India's commitment to regulatory reforms, faster approvals, streamlined imports/exports, and reduced compliance burdens, all aimed at fostering transparency and accountability in business operations. Recent tax policies, including corporate tax rationalisation and Goods and Services Tax (GST), have driven significant tax buoyancy, resulting in record-high revenues. Businesses are now calling for stable and simplified tax laws to enhance the ease of doing business and support India’s growth trajectory. Approximately 67 percent of industry leaders, according to a Deloitte Survey, anticipate this to be a key focus in the upcoming budget. A stable and pragmatic tax policy is crucial for sustainable business expansion and increased foreign investments, reducing uncertainty caused by frequent policy changes and disputes. Simplified tax structure: Navigating India’s tax structure has long been a formidable task for businesses, impacting their operational efficiency and overall ease of doing business. There is a pressing need to shift the tax paradigm from focusing on rates to prioritising revenue generation. This transformation can be achieved through moderate tax rates and an expanded tax base, aligning with the vision of 'Developed India' by 2047. Simplifying the tax structure could entail implementing a unified rate for businesses, while individuals can benefit from a straight forward 2 to 3 tier-rate structure featuring low or moderate rates, eliminating surcharges, cesses and maximising deductions. With the rising inflation, the current standard deduction limit of INR 50,000 is insufficient to cover the escalating costs and expenses associated with higher standard of living. There is a strong expectation for a higher linked standard deduction. Additionally, suspending tax compliance requirements during maternity or other significant life events would significantly reduce the compliance burden for individuals, particularly women. There is also a necessity to reform the capital gains tax framework by simplifying rules concerning asset holding periods, varying tax rates, and indexation benefits. India also has an extensive and daunting withholding tax regime - Tax Deduction at Source (TDS) and Tax Collection at Source (TCS) - on domestic transactions. This TDS/ TCS regime raises the compliance cost and resource burden on businesses in India. There are challenges for vendors/ buyers in availing withholding tax credits. The use of technology to substantially increase information collection and use by the government for monitoring and compliance should also be an opportunity for reducing the compliance burden on taxpayers. The existing GST database can be leveraged by the Government to restrict the scope of transactions subject to TDS/ TCS to only those transactions that are not captured under GST. Besides reducing the scope of transactions on which TDS/TCS is imposed, there is also scope to standardize the TDS/TCS rates and thresholds for the transactions that will still remain subject to TDS/ TCS. Reducing unwarranted litigation: Even though India ranked overall at 63 in the World Bank’s Report on Doing Business, it still ranks below 100 on 3 of the 11 indicators used to compute the overall rank of countries. These are enforcing contracts (163), registering property (154), and paying taxes (115). Enforcing contracts and paying taxes are areas where a weak dispute resolution procedure weighs heavily on the business environment in India. Tax disputes in India have risen significantly over the past few years. Many disputes are overturned on appeal, highlighting the need to eliminate unnecessary aggressive assessments. Despite measures like the Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme (VsV), increasing monetary thresholds for filing appeals, high litigation rates continue to plague the business environment. Addressing this requires robust mechanisms to resolve both current and future tax disputes swiftly and efficiently. * Only taxpayer to appeal before tribunal: Restricting appeals before tax tribunals to only taxpayers, as seen in other countries like the US and UK, would enhance efficiency and reduce bureaucratic hurdles. * Using GenAI: Technological advancements, such as generative AI (GenAI) and the deployment of legal bots, present an opportunity to revolutionise tax administration processes. These tools can be extensively trained on legal precedents. Taxpayers' submissions could be digitally analysed by these machines, enabling the tax administration to receive a proposed order based on a thorough analysis of both legal principles and factual data. This approach not only facilitates timely case resolution but also enhances the quality of decisions made. Another potential application could be reimagining the VsV to offer customised settlement terms to taxpayers based on assessments made by GenAI regarding the gravity of the case. Unlike the previous VsV, which primarily relied on whether an appeal was filed by the taxpayer or tax department, this updated approach could offer favorable terms when GenAI identifies a strong taxpayer case, and vice versa. * Strengthening alternate dispute resolution: Reintroducing faceless tax settlements, while leveraging technology tools would promote faster dispute resolutions and also address concerns related to discretionary practices historically associated with tax settlements. Additionally, avenues like mediation and arbitration should be explored which is an established practice in countries such as the UK and US. * Enhancing APA procedures: Refining APAs to ensure tax certainty and reduce compliance costs involves procedural improvements such as e-filing, expedited processes, and streamlined post-APA compliance. Transition to digitisation: The Government has been proactive in developing both physical and digital infrastructure recently, with plans to sustain this momentum. Industry leaders strongly advocate for advancing digitisation through an online single-window system to streamline administrative procedures, reduce paperwork, and expedite necessary approvals. Cybersecurity and regulatory compliance remain critical concerns, highlighting the need to address security risks and ensure regulatory adherence in digital initiatives across industries. Advancing research and development (R&D) initiatives is crucial for driving economic growth, technological advancement, and global competitiveness. Evaluating India's current R&D funding landscape and its outcomes is essential to maximise its impact. The government is anticipated to focus on investment reforms to attract capital for manufacturing and R&D, aiming to boost production scale and competitiveness. Promoting R&D within domestic companies and fostering global R&D services in India to cultivate a skilled talent pool will accelerate innovation, particularly in advancing semiconductor technology. The upcoming Union Budget for fiscal year 2024-25, themed 'Viksit Bharat', aims to outline India’s path to becoming a developed nation by 2047. Ensuring policy consistency and implementing crucial reforms to improve the business environment are critical to achieving this goal. Emphasising a stable and simplified tax regime, along with effective dispute resolution mechanisms, move towards digitisation and advancement of R&D initiatives will enhance India’s global competitiveness in terms of ease of doing business and enable efficient resource allocation for sustained economic growth.

Economy booms but India's young hanker for government jobs,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy-booms-but-indias-young-hanker-for-government-jobs-12773895.html,Economy,"Sunil Kumar, a 30-year-old, has spent the last 9 years of his life chasing a job in the Indian government. Packed with scores of others in makeshift classrooms under tin roofs with barely enough light and air, Kumar has spent years cramming for a variety of tests, including the prestigious civil services exam needed to get a job as a federal government bureaucrat. He has also tried for a provincial civil services post and two other tests for lower level government positions. He has been unsuccessful in 13 attempts to get a job. A resident of Uttar Pradesh, the country's most populous state, Kumar says he will continue to try for a government job until he turns 32, three years short of the cut-off for him to appear in a civil services exam. ""There is more security in government jobs,"" said Kumar. ""If it happens in 2-3 years, the struggle of 10 years will be worth it."" According to government figures, 220 million people applied for federal jobs between 2014-2022, of whom 722,000 were selected. Many of those would have been repeat attempts, but still, tens of millions of young Indians chase government jobs every year even though the economy is booming and the private sector is expanding. The trend underscores cultural and economic anxieties facing many Indians. Despite living in the world's fastest-growing major economy, many are grappling with an uncertain employment market where job opportunities, let alone job security, are hard to come by. Many see government employment as more secure than private-sector jobs in the world's most populous nation. ""If one person in the family gets a government job, the family believes they are settled for life,"" said Zafar Baksh, who runs a training institute for those appearing in tests for such jobs. In neighbouring Bangladesh, student protests against reserved quotas in government jobs killed more than 100 people last week. Since 2014, India's GDP has grown from $2 trillion to near $3.5 trillion in fiscal 2023-24 (April-March) and is expected to expand 7.2% in the current year. The aspirants say the government offers lifelong security, health benefits, pensions and housing, which they may not get in private employment. Few will admit to it, but many of the government jobs also offer the prospect of money under the table. Growing demand for the cram school classes has attracted large players and lessons have moved online too, said Baksh, who sees it as a lucrative and perennial business. ""There will always be demand."" NOT ENOUGH GOOD JOBS Discontent over employment opportunities was cited by analysts as a key reason for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party failing to win a majority on its own in the April-May general election, and returning to power only with the support of allies. Government data released this month showed 20 million new employment opportunities were generated in India each year since 2017/18 but private economists said much of this was self-employment and temporary farm hiring rather than formal positions with regular wages. The government, which presents the first budget since the election next week, is likely to push job creation by giving tax incentives for new manufacturing facilities as well as by encouraging local procurement across sectors like defence, Nomura said in a note this month. But these will take time to yield jobs. ""It's not just that there aren't enough jobs out there, it's also that there are not enough jobs that pay well and give you security of tenure and other benefits,"" said Rosa Abraham, assistant professor at the Centre for Sustainable Employment at Azim Premji University in Bengaluru city. For 22-year old Pradeep Gupta, who hopes to land a government job, working in the private sector is the ""last option"". ""There is honour, job security and less pressure"" in a government job, he said, speaking in the Uttar Pradesh city of Prayagraj, a booming centre of cram schools. Nearly 5 million students applied for 60,000 vacancies in the Uttar Pradesh police force earlier this year and an exam for the post of constable in central government security agencies saw 4.7 million applicants for 26,000 posts. Another giving applicants a shot at positions such as office boys and drivers in government departments, drew close to 2.6 million applicants in 2023 for about 7,500 jobs. Across all levels of government, including armed forces, schools, health services and the military, nearly 6 million jobs remain unfilled, India's main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, has estimated. An email to the federal government seeking data on government employment and vacancies was not answered. GOOD BUSINESS For Maroof Ahmed, who has been running a cram school in Prayagraj since 2014, this has meant good business. Currently, he says, his academy has five branches, tutoring close to 25,000 – 30,000 students a year through physical and online classes. Success rates, or those who procure jobs, are low at about 5-10%, but demand remains high, he said. No data was available on the number of such coaching institutes across the country since much of the industry is informal and unorganised. The clamour for government jobs is as much about attitudes toward work as it is about the state of India's job market, said Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder of staffing firm TeamLease Services. ""The private sector is based on meritocracy and responds to economic ups and downs,"" she said. ""In the government sector, once you get a job, mostly irrespective of your performance, your future is secure.""

Fiscal Deficit: Go easy or pull back? What markets are likely to reward,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/fiscal-deficit-go-easy-or-pull-back-what-markets-are-likely-to-reward-12773476.html,Economy,"By Nilesh Shah, Managing Director at Kotak Mahindra AMC The Union Budget 2024-25 will be presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 23. The fiscal deficit is avidly observed during the Union Budget presentation as it may impact various factors including the country’s rating. Also, the S&P has guided that a 7 percent or below combined (central + state governments) fiscal deficit could lead to a sovereign rating upgrade. The Government of India (GOI) has been able to walk the path of fiscal prudence and trim fiscal deficit from 9.3 percent in FY21 to 5.1 percent for FY25 (as per vote on account). The government fiscal policy has been non-inflationary so far at the same time the push for capex has been much appreciated by the markets. On one hand the government is keeping the fiscal deficit under control, on the other hand the RBI has done a commendable job in lowering inflation and maintaining robust growth. The effect of the same has been observed in both short term and long-term rates. Over the last 2 years, where the US has raised rates by 525 bps, India raised only by 250 bps. Long-term rates are up by 250 bps in the US and 25 bps in India. Globally, the broad themes are dollar weakness and dollar assets de-rating over the next 10 years. Hence, global investors are looking for economies with a superior macro front. Click Here To Read All Budget Expectations The Indian equity market is the best performing in the emerging markets and is among the top 10 largest (by market cap) in the world. Additionally, GOI and the Indian economy are going to reap the benefits of Govt bonds being included in global indices. Since the announcement of the inclusion of Indian government bonds in the JP Morgan GBI-EM, Indian Government Bonds has seen net inflows of Rs 90,000 crore till June 2024. This clearly shows that global investors are looking to increase their allocation to the Indian market. India’s rating upgrade if achieved in the years ahead could bring in substantial incremental flows leading to reduced borrowing cost which can help government spend more money to boost the economy. Hence, the government should continue the good work carried out over the last year and follow the fiscal roadmap plan. Also read: Boosting Agricultural Exports: Budgeting for infrastructure, high-value crops, and ag-tech The government's first major action after its third term was to aid with the construction of an additional three crore rural and urban houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). The scheme appears populist, however, the bulk of the expenditure would be capital in nature. GOI can focus on such additional populist schemes which end up achieving the dual objective of boosting non-inflationary growth and are perceived to be populist. GOI has been slow on disinvestment over the last few years. With the rally in the Indian stock market, the PSU market cap has seen a sharp recovery hence, GOI may consider liquidating its stake where the market float is low. Disinvestment will help the government to manage the revenues prudently without compromising on the fiscal roadmap of 4.5 percent or lower in FY26. Also read: Budget Snapshot | A long view of India’s central government budgets The GOI received Rs 2.11 lakh crore in the form of dividends from the Reserve Bank of India for FY24 which is Rs 1 lakh crore more than what the government had budgeted. This puts the government in a robust situation to manage fiscal deficit by 30 bps on account of the RBI dividend. However, they have some room to increase the tax slab to benefit the middle-class tax payer and keep the major eye on the capex and keep walking the path of fiscal prudence. Also, the government’s strong tax collection and tax buoyancy can provide incremental support to capex supporting the GDP growth in a non-inflationary manner. Given the backdrop, the Indian markets and the investors have reaped significant benefits from the fiscal policy adopted by the GOI over the course of the decade. The continuity on the same front will be rewarded by all asset classes over the medium to long term. Let’s go ahead and seize the moment.

The results come just days before the government is to release its economic survey, predicting future trajectory of growth and Budget. The survey indicated that firms expecting an improvement in conditions went up to 71 percent from 66 percent earlier. The survey interviewed 497 firms across six cities in June to find out their assessment of the present climate, capacity utilisation, financial conditions, and economic assessment over the next six months. “Firms’ perception about the improvement in their own financial position is particularly noteworthy as the share of such firms was 67 percent, the highest since Q3 of 2010-11 (76%),” said Bornali Bhandari, professor, NCAER. The number of firms perceiving an improvement in investment climate went up to 60 percent from nearly half in the previous quarter, with 97.8 percent reporting capacity utilisation at optimal levels. “It also found an uptick in the labour markets’ sentiments as compared with the previous quarter, with more firms planning to increase hiring,” the report noted. The Purchasing Managers’ Index for both manufacturing and services has recorded improvements in activity, with firms reporting multi-year highs in job creation. Notably, the Indian economy is poised to grow faster than earlier expected according to international agencies and the Reserve Bank of India. The IMF recently revised India’s growth forecast upward, expecting the economy to grow 7 percent in FY25, while the RBI expects India to log 7.2 percent growth in the current fiscal.

Speaking at an event organised by Financial Express here, the bureaucrat-turned-central banker said nobody has expected him to be a ""cheerleader"" for the government during his term. ""I am saying from my experience. Nobody expects RBI to be a cheerleader. I have had no such experience,"" he said, responding to a specific question about a lament made by one of his predecessors in a recent book. Asked if he is open for a new term at Mint Road, Das said he is very focused on the current assignment and does not think of anything outside that. Das said the RBI is optimistic that its estimate of 7.2 per cent growth for FY25 will be met, and added that with steady growth, the focus of the policy has to be ""clearly and unambiguously"" on inflation. The inflation elephant is taking pauses and grudgingly moving towards the forest or the 4 per cent target in an unidirectional way, he added. He asked the banks to be watchful on the lag between credit and deposit growth and advised that the former should not exceed the latter. The Governor also warned that the financial system can get exposed to ""structural liquidity issues"" due to the lag between the credit and deposit growth. Amid concerns about Mule accounts being used by fraudsters, Das asked banks to strengthen their customer onboarding and transaction monitoring systems to check unscrupulous activities. The RBI is working with banks and law enforcement agencies to check Mule accounts and digital frauds, he added. Das said RBI's actions on the unsecured lending have had the desired impact and growth in the focus segment has moderated, but flagged concerns on the high ceilings on unsecured lending kept by some banks despite having high exposures already. He advised prudence to such banks and added that they should avoid exuberance. In light of his comments on Friday, which are also preceded by some actions taken by RBI against some errant entities, Das clarified that no one should assume that there is a big problem with the banking system and added that it remains very stable and healthy. The RBI is not looking at any proposal on allowing corporate entities to own or promote banks at present, Das said, adding that the issue of related party transactions is very real and having any control over them is difficult. He said India does not need a proliferation of banks, but well-governed and stable institutions, he said, adding that the on-tap facility for universal bank licenses continues to be open for those qualifying as fit and proper.

Federal Reserve’s critics on inflation should now champion July cut,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/federal-reserves-critics-on-inflation-should-now-champion-july-cut-12772066-12772066.html,Economy,"Back in 2021, legions of critics lambasted the Federal Reserve for failing to take proactive and forward-looking steps against the emerging inflation threat. Curiously, many of them have gone silent on the risk that the Fed might get caught flatfooted again, this time by failing to cut interest rates soon enough in the face of weaker inflation and a cooling labor market. Lawrence Summers, the former US Treasury Secretary and a paid Bloomberg TV contributor, was perhaps the most notable critic of the “behind the curve” Fed a few years back. As recently as a few months ago, he was still warning against rate cuts and floating the idea that the central bank’s next move could be a hike. Summers isn’t an island unto himself, however, as about a third of economists surveyed by Bloomberg saw one or no cuts this year. Consider the cross-section of monetary policy rules, which generate fed funds rate prescriptions based on standard economic variables. Just as they showed that the Fed was behind the curve in 2021 and 2022, four of the five common policy rules — including the classic 1993 Taylor Rule — now suggest policy rates below the current 5.25%-5.5% range. The core personal consumption expenditures deflator — the Fed’s preferred gauge — puts year-over-year inflation at just about 2.6%, less than half of the peak rate of 5.6% in February 2022. While that’s still technically above the Fed’s 2% target, the current policy stance implies a lot of medicine for what’s become a relatively mild ailment. Among the Fed’s top leaders, the goal of forward-looking monetary policy is uncontroversial. The question, however, is how one can put forward-looking policy into practice while also remaining beholden to backward-looking data. Here’s how Chair Jerome Powell tried to explain this dance at an Economic Club of Washington event, in conversation with Bloomberg host and Carlyle Co-Chairman David Rubenstein (emphasis mine):Rubenstein: The Fed has set a target for inflation of 2%. Now, can you clarify? Does that mean that the inflation rate has to be at 2% before you’re ready to move, if you are ready to move? Or does it have to be within sight? And what does it mean to be within sight? Powell: So, when we change interest rates, that tightens financial conditions and that, in turn, affects economic outcomes — you know, growth, labor markets and ultimately inflation, but with lags that can be long and variable, as Milton Friedman famously said. And the implication of that is that if you wait until inflation gets all the way down to 2%, you’ve probably waited too long. Because the tightening that you’re doing — the tightness that you have — is still having effects which will probably drive inflation below 2%. So we’ve been very clear that you wouldn’t wait for inflation to get all the way down to 2%. Our test has been for the past quite some time that we wanted to have greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably down toward our 2% target, and what increases that confidence is more good inflation data. And lately we have been getting some of that. In fairness, Powell has navigated the risks extremely well since mid-2022, and he deserves a lot of credit for putting the American economy in a position to achieve a rare “soft landing.” But he still has to stick it, and there are a number of problems with the “test” that he described. First, there’s room for debate about where underlying inflation actually sits today. The oft-sighted year-over-year figure, of course, is a function of base effects from 12 months earlier. On a three-month annualized basis, core PCE appears to already be below 2%, based on Bloomberg Economics’estimates for the yet-to-be released June data. Many of us have also argued that the entire housing component of inflation feels a lot like yesterday’s news. If you cut it out of the index, year-on-year core PCE inflation is under 2%. I’m not advocating that anyone exclusively use those bespoke slices of the data, but you have to take them into consideration at key inflection points like this one. Second, there’s room for debate about what, exactly, would give the Fed “greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably” toward target. I appreciate the spirit of this Powellism because many of us were head-faked by earlier improvements in the inflation data. But we’ve just had three great reports. And the government data has now hit the mark in about 8 of the past 12 months, lending less weight to the first-quarter numbers that weren’t so pristine. In a data series that’s inherently imperfect and noisy, that strikes me as enough. Personally, that’s why I’ve been in the July rate-cut camp since the immaculate consumer price index report on July 11. As I said at the time, I still have serious doubts that the Fed will listen, primarily because they’ve convinced themselves that they can, indeed, be simultaneously “forward looking” and “data dependent.” They also seem to believe that they have to spend weeks priming the markets for their first move through subtle smoke signals in the Fed’s policy statement and, probably, through a series of speeches — giving modern markets too little credit. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has climbed in each of the past three months. To be sure, the unemployment drift owes itself largely to labour market entrants, re-entrants and relatively weak hiring, and layoffs remain very low. But history has shown that labour market trouble can snowball in a hurry. So why take the chance? A cut at the following meeting in September probably wouldn’t be the end of the world, but waiting introduces the risk that the window of opportunity could close. In a July 15 note titled “Why Wait?,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc Chief Economist Jan Hatzius also observed that inflation data — while encouraging now — is inherently volatile. If policymakers wait, he said they may find that the data won’t cooperate, and the rate reduction could be “awkward” to explain. Then what, November? Hatzius also noted that the September meeting would come right before the presidential election, and policymakers may want to avoid the perception of putting their thumb on the scale. Ultimately, they shouldn’t get caught waiting for a perfect opportunity when it might never arrive. Hatzius summed it up best: “If the case for a cut is clear, why wait another seven weeks before delivering it?” Credit: Bloomberg  ",NEGATIVE,2024-07-18
Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | Karnataka’s risky experiment on job reservation ,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/moneycontrol-pro-panorama-karnatakas-risky-experiment-on-job-reservation-12771931.html,Economy,"Dear Reader, The Panorama newsletter is sent to Moneycontrol Pro subscribers on market days. It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. First things first.In the last two days, I saw a lot of anger on social media after a controversial Bill by the Karnataka state government ruffled feathers when it proposed mandatory reservation of up to 70 percent for locals in private jobs. Why would the state do such a thing to risk Bengaluru’s image as an emerging global tech-startup hub and deter fresh investments? Unsurprisingly, industry leaders and senior ministers  were up in arms against the proposal from the word go. And, as expected, a day later the state government put the proposal on hold. Frankly, implementation of such a Bill would have been disastrous. One, the status of Bengaluru as a global tech and startup hub would have taken a hit if companies were forced to scan domicile certificates, rather than merit records.Secondly, this would have had a cascading impact on the local economy.(God save those Bengaluru retirees relying on rental income for a living when ‘outsiders’ start vacating flats!).  That’s not all. If other states too followed Karnataka’s formula, we would be looking at nothing less than total chaos in the job market. Overall, Karnataka quota-for-locals is a hare-brained idea. But I totally get why the state wanted to bring local reservations in the first place—a major job crisis is in the making. Lack of opportunities for newcomers and influx into the job market post mega layoffs are adding to the woes. Just yesterday, I read a report  about a stampede-like situation when more than 25,000 applicants turned up for 2,600 vacancies walked in for an interview at Air India Airport Services Ltd recruitment drive for airport loaders. This isn’t an isolated incident.According to the India Employment Report 2024 published by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the Institute of Human Development (IHD), nearly 83% of the jobless population under the age of 34 . In this context, it’s quite logical that local governments want to entice local vote banks, offering job reservations. But come on! You can’t throw the baby out with the bathwater. Moving on, the Union Budget 2024-2025 is scheduled next Tuesday. The general consensus is that the government will stick to the path of fiscal consolidation and use the Rs 2 trillion RBI dividend to cushion its expenditure plans, keeping the fiscal slippage under check. Investors are hoping for a direct consumption push and tax cuts. But, if any hike in capital gains tax happens, it could also act as a big markets dampener. On the other hand, if the government chooses to give the big Budget push to affordable housing, as my colleague Aparna Iyer writes in this piece, it will augur well for a rural economic revival and help create more jobs. The probability of a big infra push in this Budget is a fair expectation as my colleagues Jitendra Kumar Gupta and Bharat Gianani wrote in this piece . A bunch of construction-related stocks may draw investor attention. In India, the onus to fund long-term infra projects remain a burden of PSBs—a key reasons why the government won’t privatise these banks. Ideally, they should; as I wrote a few days ago.

India targets $110 billion FDI a year to help boost economy,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/india-targets-110-billion-fdi-a-year-to-help-boost-economy-12771920.html,Economy,"India is aiming to boost annual foreign direct investment by more than 50% to help lift economic growth, according to a top official at the government’s investment promotion agency. “For the next seven years, our goal is to draw $110 billion per year which amounts roughly $1 trillion plus over the next 10 years,” Nivruti Rai, managing director of Invest India, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV’s Paul Allen on Thursday. “We have to work hard toward growing at a rate higher than 10%.” India’s annual average FDI in the seven years through March 2023 amounted to $71 billion, according to figures from the investment agency, which is a joint venture between the Ministry of Commerce and private business chambers. Official data from the government show a decline in FDI into India since 2022, even though the country is positioning itself as an alternative manufacturing hub to China, with companies like Apple Inc. setting up factories in the country in recent years. Invest India has highlighted eight priority areas for investment: electronics manufacturing, automobiles, infrastructure, green energy, food processing, textiles, pharmaceuticals and foreign institutional investment. Rai believes these sectors will help India achieve economic growth of more than 10%. Commenting on recent news that Tesla Inc.’s investment in India has cooled, Rai said she was “not concerned” and that the trend is still for higher investment.

"Fiscal deficit at 5% of GDP for FY25, nominal growth at 11%: MC Economists Poll",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/fiscal-deficit-at-5-of-gdp-for-fy25-nominal-growth-at-11-mc-economists-poll-12771730.html,Economy,"The government is likely to record a lower fiscal deficit and a higher growth than what was estimated in the Interim Budget, as it retains its focus on fiscal prudence, economists said in a poll conducted by Moneycontrol. The median forecast of 16 economists pegged the fiscal deficit at 5 percent of the GDP, 10 basis points lower than the 5.1 percent target set in the Interim Budget. None of the economists polled by Moneycontrol expects a slippage on the fiscal front.  On the other hand, the economists noted that the output is likely to get a boost with the government projecting an 11 percent nominal growth, compared with 10.5 percent projected in the Interim Budget. IDFC First Bank and ANZ pegged the growth at 11.5 percent, higher than other forecasts in the poll.  India saw a spate of forecast revisions on the growth front, following a better-than-expected 8.2 percent growth in FY25 and hopes of recovery in private investment and consumption. The IMF on July 16 revised its FY25 growth forecast for real GDP to 7 percent from 6.8 percent projected in April. Capital spending is expected to remain unchanged from the interim budget at Rs 11.11 lakh crore. The forecasts ranged from Rs 11 lakh crore to Rs 12 lakh crore. Push for rural The economists were unanimous in predicting that the budget will provide a push for the rural economy, muted consumption and jobless growth were the most cited concerns for the economy. Among the schemes that could push growth, the economists cited the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana as a primary driver. Sujan Hajra, chief economist, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, cited production-linked incentive schemes and PMAY as schemes that could have a major impact. Rajani Sinha, chief economist at CareEdge, was upbeat on Skill India and PLI as major impact initiators, while Aditi Nayar, chief economist at Icra, said that the scheme for special assistance to states for capital expenditure could have a major impact. Over two-thirds of the economists did cite increased rural allocations, PMAY as one of the three social interventions expected in the budget, with 64 percent batting for rural development or increased rural allocation and 50 percent citing PMAY.  Moreover, 90 percent noted that there was a case for expansion for rural employment scheme, the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, Krishi Kalyan and Ayushman Bharat programme. A higher nominal growth and more-than-expected dividend from the Reserve Bank of India to the tune of Rs 1.3 lakh crore is expected to provide space for the government to expand coverage of schemes. Shift in focus The focus is also likely to shift away from 2047, as only 60 percent of the economists were sure that the government will lay a roadmap for 2047 in the upcoming budget. “Provisions for adequate capital to support National Infrastructure Pipeline and PM Gatishakti programmes should be the primary priority area for Vision 2047,” said Debopam Chaudhuri of Piramal Enterprises Ltd.

India plans to ease rice export curbs as stocks surge to record,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/india-plans-to-ease-rice-export-curbs-as-stocks-surge-to-record-12771895.html,Economy,"India is likely to cut the floor price for basmati rice exports and replace the 20% export tax on parboiled rice with a fixed duty on overseas shipments, government sources said, as rice inventories in the country jumped a record high. The world's biggest rice exporter imposed various curbs on exports in 2023 and continued them in 2024 in an effort to keep local prices in check ahead of the general elections held in April-May. New Delhi is expected to lower the basmati rice's minimum export price (MEP) to $800-$850 a metric ton, down from $950 a ton, to boost shipments, said the sources, who didn't wish to be identified as they are not authorised to talk to media. Lowering the MEP would help India retain its market share against Pakistan, which exported a record amount of rice this year due to New Delhi's export curbs. India and Pakistan are the leading exporters of basmati rice. New Delhi exports more than 4 million metric tons of basmati - the premium long-grain variety famed for its aroma - to countries such as Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the United States. New Delhi is also expected to drop the 20% export tax on parboiled rice and introduce a minimum export tax to stop under-invoicing of shipments, the sources said. The government was examining possibilities of easing rice export curb, including resuming white rice exports, Reuters reported last month. Â  Â  Worried over expectations of lower output due to the El Nino weather pattern, India banned overseas shipments of non-basmati white rice varieties in July 2023 and imposed curbs on other grades. ""With rice supplies significantly exceeding local demand, it's crucial to reduce stockpiles to prevent spoilage. The most effective solution is to lift export restrictions,"" said B.V. Krishna Rao, president of the Rice Exporters Association (REA). The country's rice stocks at state warehouses have jumped to 48.51 million metric tons as of July 1, the highest ever for the month and nearly 19% more than last year, according to the Food Corporation of India. New Delhi would also review the export ban on non-basmati white rice after assessing the progress of rice planting, the sources said. Farmers have so far planted 11.6 million hectares with rice paddy during the current planting, up 20.7% on the same period last year.

India’s digital payments system needs simpler KYC process to reach newer heights,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/indias-digital-payments-system-needs-simpler-kyc-process-to-reach-newer-heights-12771464.html,Economy,"India's digitalization journey has become a notable success, with the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) standing out globally as a model case study. The rise of digital payments in India, from $300 billion in 2018 to $3.6 trillion in 2024, with projections to double by 2030, demonstrates a significant transformation. Robust demographic expansion, improved economic conditions, widespread internet access, and strong government support for digital infrastructure have fuelled this growth in digital payments across the country. Along with UPI, other digital payment instruments such as cards and digital wallets have also gained traction, accounting for around 10% of current digital transaction values. This progress aligns with the Reserve Bank of India's goal to widely expand digital payments. India has established itself as a global leader in the digital payment sector, accounting for a significant percentage of worldwide transaction volumes. UPI's acceptance in several countries, with plans to expand further, underscores its international success. The decline in cash-based transactions to less than 60% highlights the widespread adoption of digital payments across India. UPI’s interoperability, ease of use, and real-time settlement have made it a preferred choice for a wide range of transactions, from peer-to-peer transfers to merchant payments. UPI transactions have experienced remarkable growth, surpassing 10 billion monthly transactions. Additionally, with countries like Singapore, the UAE, Mauritius, Oman, and Indonesia accepting UPI payments there has been a significant increase in cross-border transactions using the UPI method of payment. Transcending Demographic Categories Digital payments are now preferred across demographics, significantly changing consumer behaviours for both online and offline transactions. As of 2024, UPI also boasts over 260 million users, and this number is expected to grow even further as smart devices are becoming increasingly popular. According to a jointly produced report by AT Kearney and Amazon Pay, 90% of consumers opt for digital methods for online purchases, while 50% prefer digital payments for offline transactions as well. Digital payments are especially popular for discretionary spending such as electronics, clothing, and footwear, indicating a notable shift in purchasing behaviour. Millennials are at the forefront of adopting all types of digital payment instruments. The primary reasons for this widespread adoption are the convenience, speed, and efficiency of digital transactions. Additionally, boomers have significantly embraced digital payments, with higher usage of cards and wallets. Adoption rates among genders are roughly equal, with both men and women using digital payments in 72% of their transactions. Digital payment integration has been extensive in urban areas, with smaller towns reporting a 65% adoption rate and larger cities around 75%. Emerging technologies like co-branded credit cards and Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) schemes are rapidly gaining popularity, showing significant consumer awareness and adoption. Merchants across various sectors, from street vendors to large retail establishments, have also adopted digital payments, which constitute approximately 69% of their transaction volumes. This adoption is driven by need to mitigate challenges like financial fraud and handling cash. KYC Processes Have Scope for Improvement The future growth of India's digital payments ecosystem will depend on increasing penetration in underserved segments and boosting transaction values through digital means. A collaborative effort among all stakeholders, including payment providers, governmental agencies, and service players, is essential for sustained growth. An area for improvement that will further drive adoption involves simplifying Know Your Customer (KYC) processes, which are currently seen as cumbersome due to extensive documentation and verification requirements. Though Aadhaar-based KYC exists, streamlining it further through advanced technologies for identity verification, such as biometrics and artificial intelligence, would securely expedite identity confirmation with minimal hassle for users. Additionally, adjusting KYC requirements to match the risk levels of different transaction types could enhance the user experience without compromising security. Simplifying KYC would improve the customer and merchant experiences and broaden access, encouraging more users to adopt digital payments. Supportive Regulatory Environment As India progresses towards a digital-first economy, building trust and ensuring convenience will be crucial. By addressing the needs of both consumers and merchants and fostering a supportive regulatory environment, India is poised to maintain its leadership in the digital payment sector, ensuring continuous growth and enhancing economic inclusivity. The government's focus on creating a conducive regulatory environment has fostered innovation and growth in the digital payments sector. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has played a pivotal role in developing guidelines and frameworks to ensure the security and reliability of digital transactions. Measures such as two-factor authentication, tokenization, and the Payments Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF) have strengthened the ecosystem. Digital payments' impact extends beyond the financial sector, with significant implications for economic growth and social development. Increased use of digital transactions has led to greater financial transparency and improve targeting of government subsidies and welfare schemes. Additionally, digital payments have opened new avenues for financial inclusion, particularly for underserved segments such as rural populations and small businesses, where credit and insurance products can be designed based on history of UPI transactions. Privacy Concerns Need to be Addressed As India's digital payments ecosystem evolves and we move into a cashless economy, challenges remain. The collection and handling of vast amounts of personal data by payment providers raise concerns about data privacy. As concerns about data privacy increase, the risk of cyberattacks, fraud, and hacking also increases. Digital payment providers need to ensure that cybersecurity measures are mandated to protect user data and maintain consumer trust in the digital payment ecosystem. The government and industry stakeholders must work together to enhance system resilience, educate users, and promote responsible innovation. While bigger cities in the country have relatively better digital infrastructure, rural and remote areas often face issues with internet connectivity and access to digital payment services. The government should ensure that it takes measures to enhance digital infrastructure across the country to make sure there is uniform growth. Despite these challenges, the future of digital payments in India is promising. Through collaborative efforts among the government, industry stakeholders, and users, India can continue to advance its digital payments ecosystem and achieve greater financial inclusion and economic growth. As India continues to lead the global digital payments revolution, it sets an example for other nations aspiring to create inclusive, efficient, and secure financial systems.

The country's combined food and fertiliser bill is expected to reach 3.88 trillion rupees, up 5% rise from the estimate in the interim budget unveiled before the election. Interim budget estimates will be replaced by a new budget from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government that will be presented on July 23.

In the interim budget, the food subsidy bill was estimated at 2.05 trillion rupees, two of the sources said. The increase since then is largely due to a rise in the price at which the government buys rice and wheat from domestic farmers, one of the sources said. Meanwhile, the government is likely to stick to its previous estimate of 1.64 trillion rupees for the fertiliser subsidy, two of the sources said.

India needs to face up to its junk food crisis,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/india-needs-to-face-up-to-its-junk-food-crisis-12774831.html,Politics,"India is not the world’s healthiest country. Sadly, regulators seem determined to make the problem worse with each passing year. Urban Indians, especially wealthier ones, have a relatively sedentary lifestyle, and our diet is heavy in carbohydrates and fats. This may not show up easily in the numbers, given the size of the country’s population.Analysis in the Lancet recently found that about 23% of Indians were technically overweight, defined as a body mass index over 25. Many parts of the world, such as West Asia and Eastern Europe, do much worse. But, when you break the data down, worrying trends emerge. Women over 30, for instance, have startlingly high rates of abdominal obesity in India — with a prevalence of over 55% for women older than 40. That is a more dangerous indicator of predisposition to metabolic disease than regular BMI. Moreover, genetics seem to make Indians particularly vulnerable to such ailments. One scientist at the generic pharma major Lupin Ltd has pointed out that Indians tend to have greater insulin resistance and develop Type II diabetes at a younger age than the average. The Lancet suggests that over 100 million Indians have diabetes, and 136 million are pre-diabetic. That’s a crisis — one that’s set to grow worse as India becomes richer and more urban. The problem is usually blamed on a change in the diets of middle-class Indians, from fresh to processed foods. The assumption is that packaged products are unhealthier. It’s right there in the name: “junk food.” I’m a tiny bit skeptical. I am addicted to Delhi’s deep-fried street food, and I am not so sure it is better for me than anything I could buy in a supermarket. At the same time, there is data suggesting junk food in India is worse than in many other countries, with higher levels of salt, sugar, and saturated fats. More importantly, packaged food can be regulated, so people at least know what they’re eating. Ideally, that would allow consumers to better manage their intake of fat and salt. There remains a lot of room for this transition in India. Nestle India Ltd. claims that branded food makes up only a third of the Indian market but will expand at a compound annual growth rate above 12% in coming years. The question is whether regulators are up to the task. They recently announced that nutritional information about sugar, salt and saturated fat would henceforth be displayed “in bold letters and relatively increased font size on labels of packaged food items.” The news was generally welcomed. In fact, it represented a significant climbdown. The new rules specify that this information will be estimated based on (arbitrary) serving sizes, and as a percentage of recommended daily intake. Translating this into “good” or “bad” requires a level of mental math that the average shopper likely won’t want to endure. The regulations replace a draft plan that would have imposed fewer requirements on shoppers but was still flawed. In 2022, officials proposed a “star” rating, similar to the ones used to indicate if an appliance is energy-efficient. As scientists pointed out, that merely “helps the consumer choose the least unhealthy option among a host of unhealthy options.” Critics worry that India’s food regulators respond more readily to big food companies than to doctors. The last time they backtracked on warning labels, they placated angry consumers by telling them a new adviser would study the issue — a man whom the New York Times described as leading an institution “almost entirely funded by the Goliaths of the agribusiness, food, and pharmaceutical industries.” The processed food industry is shooting itself in the foot. If companies want Indians to make the switch from mouth-watering street food, they ought to welcome greater transparency, so consumers can be certain they are choosing healthier alternatives. Better models are available even in India’s neighborhood. In Sri Lanka, for example, sodas are labeled with a “traffic light” system that goes from green (healthy) to red (godawful levels of sugar). Recent research has shown that the system consistently steers consumers towards healthier choices. Indians need simple, easy-to-understand, and prominent warning labels, so that their better natures are given a chance to overtake their impulses. Otherwise, their richer country will only be an unhealthier one. Credit: Bloomberg  ",NEGATIVE,2024-07-22
US: Democrats clear the runway for Kamala Harris,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/us-democrats-clear-the-runway-for-kamala-harris-12774830.html,Politics,"Barring an unexpected turn of events in a season of unexpected turns of events, Vice President Kamala Harris will be the next Democratic nominee for president. “I think it’s almost inevitable that Kamala Harris will end up being the nominee,” Robert Shrum, Director of the Center for the Political Future at the University of Southern California and a veteran of a half century of Democratic campaigns, told me. President Joe Biden’s departure from the race on Sunday was one man’s extraordinary decision. But it was a sum of the efforts of thousands. The Democratic Party was not uniformly in favor of jettisoning Biden. But its center of gravity had shifted against him. There are two points that are especially notable about that fact, and both are highly relevant to the weeks ahead. First, the Democratic Party has a center of gravity and that center found itself. Second, that gravitational mass just completed an unprecedented work of collective action, involving both party elites and rank and file, with the work taking place both publicly and privately. It was an uncanny feat in a party representing tens of millions of individuals. Democrats accomplished the political equivalent of soaring off the high dive into a bucket of water. Now, some are demanding that the party recreate the act, only this time with a few added somersaults and twists. A wide-open convention in Chicago? A televised traveling circus with Bill Clinton andBarack Obama interviewing aspirants for the nation’s highest office? Oprah something something? No. The Democratic National Committee’s convention rules committee met virtually on Friday and reaffirmed that the party’s virtual roll call vote, nominating the party’s candidates for president and vice president, would take place between Aug. 1 and Aug. 7. There are hard deadlines that the party must meet for the nominees to be on state ballots. Harris should be looking to sew up support quickly, and be the consensus choice by the first week of August. The party convention should be used to remind the nation who Donald Trump is. Likely Republican lawsuits to prevent Biden from withdrawing from the ballot, or the party from choosing a replacement, present an opportunity to remind voters that Jan. 6 is a state of mind in MAGA land, and that free elections are at risk if Republicans succeed. Biden’s departure will surely whet the appetites of ambitious Democrats who would like to be president. But no credible challenger countered Biden’s reelection campaign in part because no one wanted to risk the blame for, or reality of, a second Trump presidency and its attendant assault on democratic institutions and practices. That political deterrent, which governed party behavior from 2022 to the present, should continue to check some ambitions between now and the first week of August. Fortunately for the party, the obvious contenders are mostly young and can afford to wait for another chance. The three words that risk party fratricide – “now or never” – don’t apply to 52-year-old Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer or 42-year-old Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg or even 56-year-old California Governor Gavin Newsom. Both Whitmer and Newsom, the most viable challengers, have said they will not run against Harris, 59. Their restraint will make an already difficult challenge slightly more daunting for any second-tier candidates contemplating a run. A veteran Democratic consultant with no particular affinity for Harris told me that it was difficult to conceive of a rationale for a campaign against her. Consensus began building for Harris within minutes. As Georgetown University political scientist Jonathan Ladd wrote on social media, the party appears to be making its decision “in fast forward.” That leaves Harris in the dominant position. Biden endorsed her, which will help influence his most fervent supporters. Her task in the days ahead is to ward off potential challengers, consolidate support and contemplate running mates. The vice-presidential nomination should prove extremely attractive: a less than four-month campaign for the White House with virtually no chance of being blamed for a defeat. With democracy on the line, the incentive toward another round of partywide collective action is strong. Harris is not fully trusted as a top-tier candidate. She occasionally fumbles. She might lose a few White votes that Biden might have claimed. But she brings genuine strengths. She may excite some of the young voters – especially young women – who turned away from Biden. She may inspire new energy among Black voters. She gives women a different stake in the race than they had the day before Biden dropped out. Most important, she can effectively prosecute the moral, intellectual and political case against Trump, which is her primary mission. She has a lot to work with. It would be best for Democrats if she got to work quickly. Credit: Bloomberg  ",POSITIVE,2024-07-22
"'Problem in examination system': Rahul Gandhi, Akhilesh Yadav slam Pradhan over NEET row, Oppn demands resignation",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/major-problem-in-examination-system-rahul-gandhi-slams-dharmendra-pradhan-opposition-demands-ministers-resignation-12774414.html,Politics,"Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi lashed out in the Parliament on Monday concerning the Central government's handling of the NEET paper leak row, stating, ""It is evident to everyone that there is a significant problem with our examination system, affecting not just NEET but all major exams. The minister (Dharmendra Pradhan) has blamed everyone but himself. I doubt he even grasps the fundamental issues at play"". He also noted, ""The issue at hand is that millions of students in the country are deeply concerned and believe that the Indian examination system is compromised. There is a widespread perception that wealth can influence and manipulate the system. This sentiment is also shared by many in the Opposition"". Further questioning the Centre's handling of alleged paper leaks in competitive exams, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav slammed the government, claiming it is setting new records for paper leaks. ""Students nationwide are protesting, investigations are revealing more, and arrests are being made. My only request is that students will not receive justice as long as this minister remains in office,"" Yadav stated. Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, responding to the allegations, stated that exam results have been released according to the Supreme Court's directions. ""I prefer not to engage in politics, but I have records of how many paper leaks occurred during Akhilesh Yadav's tenure as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh,"" he said. Pradhan said he is serving at the ""mercy of my leader"" and stated that the government is ""collectively answerable"" for the situation. The Education minister defended his position, asserting that he has the support of his constituency and does not require validation from Parliament. He condemned Gandhi's characterisation of the examination system as ""rubbish,"" calling it an unfortunate statement. He also said, ""Over the past seven years, the National Testing Agency (NTA) has conducted more than 240 exams, with over 5 crore students applying and over 4 crore participating. While there have been incidents, the current case is under the Supreme Court's scrutiny, with the Chief Justice personally overseeing the proceedings"". Besides, Pradhan also took a dig at the previous government, referencing a ""remote control"" jab often used by the BJP against the Manmohan Singh administration. ""In 2010, three education reform bills were introduced by then-Minister Kapil Sibal, one of which aimed to prohibit unfair practices. The question remains: Why was that bill withdrawn? Was it due to pressure from private medical colleges? Now, those who questioned us are raising issues"", he noted. Opposition parties in the Lok Sabha raised concerns about exam paper leaks, demanding Pradhan’s resignation and the scrapping of the NEET, prompting Speaker Om Birla to call for a constructive discussion. Birla stated that widespread criticism could harm the perception of India's education system globally. He noted that the CBI and Supreme Court are already investigating the leaks and urged for the development of a better system rather than questioning all examinations. Following Birla's remarks, Rahul Gandhi attempted to speak but was not permitted. In protest, the LoP, along with other Opposition members from TMC and DMK, walked out of the House. Congress Deputy Leader Gaurav Gogoi led slogans demanding the resignation of Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan. Following the Opposition's walkout, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi said, ""Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan should have addressed the issue directly. Instead, he spoke about the Supreme Court and PM Modi but did not clarify his actions on the matter. NEET is a crucial issue for the youth. Despite our repeated requests for parliamentary discussion, the government shows no interest. We will continue to raise this issue and pressure the government"", during an interaction with the media.

India must play peacemaker in bloodied Bangladesh ,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/india-must-play-peacemaker-in-bloodied-bangladesh-12774075.html,Politics,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government can’t wash its hands of the bloodbath in Bangladesh – more than a 140 agitating young men have been already killed in the anti-quota protests rocking our neighbour – because India has a far bigger stake in Bangladesh than any other country in the whole world. Any upheaval there -- whether it leads to regime change or eventually dissipates – has grave implications for our national security. It’s therefore in our own strategic interests to sort out the mess on a war footing and restore normalcy there at any cost. It’s perfectly okay to take an official stand that the deadly turmoil in Bangladesh is its internal matter, advice Indian nationals there to steer clear of trouble and evacuate them if necessary, as our External Affairs Ministry has done in the circumstances. But India mustn’t stop at that because it is the resident power with onerous duties and responsibilities that it can shirk only at its own cost. As things stand today, New Delhi can’t afford to dither or look away. It has no option but to take charge as an elder brother, if not ‘big brother’, in its zone of influence. Hasina’s cancelled foreign trips indicate a big problem The volatility can be gauged from the fact that Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who had to cut short her state visit to China last week and return home to quell the violent protests by university students against job quotas which gathered momentum in her absence, has now been compelled to cancel her tour of Spain and Brazil to handle the increasingly dangerous state of affairs. An indefinite national curfew and shoot-on-sight order is in force, the army, paramilitary, tanks and armoured carriers are patrolling the streets, mobile internet and broadband service is shut down and all trains have been cancelled by Hasina’s Awami League administration, turning the densely populated Muslim nation at our doorstep into a ticking time bomb. Fake news for sympathy Notably, even as Bangladesh burned, mid-week there were reports of opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party leaders being closeted in the Chinese embassy in Dhaka with Beijing’s diplomats, who were joined by the Pakistani High Commissioner making it a threesome! These patently untrue stories were obviously planted in the media by Hasina’s government to gain India’s sympathies by characterising the skyrocketing turmoil as the handiwork of colluding anti-India BNP, Pakistani and Chinese saboteurs. Fortunately, New Delhi - which thoroughly monitors its backyard - has seen through all these canards. It is treating with equal disdain fabricated reports of anti-quota protestors demanding termination of India’s access to railways, roads and rivers in their country as one of the pre-conditions to call of their agitation. On Sunday, the Supreme Court scaled back the job quotas but hasn’t altogether abolished the highly discriminatory government job reservations which blatantly favour the Awami League and triggered the students’ rebellion. The judicial intervention is unlikely to restore normalcy immediately given the high number of casualties and brutalities inflicted by the army-police at Hasina’s behest which has created a chasm between the regime and ordinary Bangladeshis. India needs to counsel restraint In such a foreboding scenario, India’s task is cut out. Without wasting any time, New Delhi must counsel Hasina to control her temper and tongue after all the damage her loose talk, especially the abusive-derogatory term “Razakar”, has done. At the age of 76 and a four-term PM, she should speak like a grandmother-cum-elder statesman and not a rabble rouser hurtling the country into chaos and anarchy. Secondly, New Delhi must become the bridge between the Hasina government and protestors’ leaders so that the two sides sit across the table at the earliest. To put it bluntly, India’s mediation is the need of the hour in Bangladesh. Although India is known to be pro-Hasina, no one in Bangladesh is going to rebuff India if it comes forward as a peacemaker. Ukraine is very far away. Let’s start from our backyard where our standing is at an all-time high. India is the best third-party to end the spiral of violence and usher in peace after all the unnecessary bloodletting of the last few days. Hands-off policy is not realisitic Bangladesh is far too important for India to pursue a hands-off policy at this critical juncture. Let’s not forget that it is not just another neighbouring country like Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan or Sri Lanka – it’s a lot more than that. Geographically, Bangladesh is well and truly embedded “inside” India. Save for a short boundary with Myanmar and the waters of the Bay of Bengal in the south, Bangladesh is surrounded by as many as five Indian states – West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram – on all sides. In that sense, Bangladesh is indeed “inside” India – and therefore far more important than a neighbour in the traditional sense. Bangladesh’s domestic politics and governance naturally impact India more than any other country in the world. A Bangladesh on the boil would be disastrous for India’s restive northeast. So the faster we act, the better for us and our dear neighbour.

Jammu in jihadist crosshairs,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/jammu-in-jihadist-crosshairs-12774018.html,Politics,"Unlike financial analysts who start ringing alarm bells the moment they see corporate earnings either weaken or not in line with expectations in any quarter, security analysts (at least at the policy making level) seem to wait until the problem can no longer be explained away. Until then they prefer to quote statistics to convince everyone that everything is under control. From around 2021 there have been a series of terrorist strikes in this region, not just against civilians but also against security forces. And yet, these attacks were not considered as indicative of the shift in the area of operation from Kashmir valley to Jammu. It is only after the recent spate of ambushes of security force convoys by terrorists in the Jammu region that the security establishment has woken up to the growing presence and actions of jihadist terrorists south of Pir Panjal in J&K. Terrain hopping to avoid pressure The increase in terrorist actions in Jammu is not surprising. There was enormous security pressure in the Kashmir Valley. The shelf life of terrorists had reduced drastically, except for the odd killing of an unarmed civilian or off-duty security force official by the part-time, ‘hybrid’ terrorists active in Kashmir. It was therefore natural for terrorists, particularly the foreign (read Pakistani) terrorists to shift operations to Jammu where the terrain and geography provided them some cover, as well as easier ingress and egress routes. The fact that for close to two decades the Jammu region had been cleansed of terrorists also helped. There was just not the same laser focus on terrorism in the Jammu division that was there in Kashmir division. From around 2020, security forces had been thinned in the region and redeployed on other more active fronts. This has created some gaps in the security grid that could be exploited by the terrorists. Jammu gets reinforcements The security establishment is now once again beefing up troops in the region to hunt down the terrorists. But this could prove to be a bit of a long haul, especially if over the last three years or so the terrorists have re-established their networks of support and sustenance. As things stand, the intelligence grid of the security forces appears to be rusted. This will need to be made more robust for operations to become more effective. The engagement of security forces with locals is critical. But this too will take some doing because it will mean navigating through political grievances - people of the region feel they have been ignored and neglected - and social/communal tensions that have erupted in the last few years. Intelligence vacuum but… For now, there is no solid information or intelligence on the strength of terrorists active in the region. What is known is that these are not the garden variety hybrid terrorist that is common in Kashmir. If the terror attacks in Jammu are anything to go by, these are highly trained, disciplined, battle hardened terrorists, well versed in laying ambushes, adept in hit-and-run attacks, trained to use the terrain to their advantage to hide and strike. Signs point to Pakistan Army All these manifest attributes suggest that these are probably serving or recent retirees of Pakistan army (perhaps Special Services Group commandos), or predominantly Punjabi and some Pashtun Taliban aligned to Pakistan Army with experience of having waged jihad in Afghanistan. It still is not clear if they are surviving off the land or receiving support in the form of supplies and information - ideological, religious, political, or simply coerced - from locals. Given the areas in which attacks have taken place - from Poonch and Rajauri to Reasi, Kathua and Doda - it is unlikely if it is the same group. There are some estimates that 40-50 terrorists might be active, operating in groups of four-to-five. But that there could be more is not something that can be ruled out. From whatever is available in the public domain, it is also not clear if these terrorists are receiving instructions from their handlers sitting in Pakistan- occupied Kashmir or they are autonomous in their operations. What is clear is that the weapons they are using - US-made M4 assault rifles which are now awash in the arms bazaar in Pakistan - have given them an edge, more so because some of these are equipped with night vision devices. M4, AK-47 and Afghanistan spillover In a sense, the M4 in the 2020s is what the AK-47 was in the 1990s, when the security forces were still equipped with the unwieldy SLRs and police still carried .303 Lee Enfield rifles of WW-I vintage. It took a long time for Indian security forces to equip themselves with gear - rifles, helmets, bullet-proof vests - that was suited to anti-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations. The same is the case with the communications equipment. Back in the 1990s, while the terrorists used frequency hopping Kenwood sets, the security forces had vintage communication systems. Something similar is happening today. When the Americans abandoned Afghanistan, it was known that some of the weapons they had left behind would find their way into India. But as is the wont of the security establishment, no one really prepared for the inevitable. For some strange reason - is it a false sense of chivalry? - there appears to be a reluctance to deploy frontline weapon systems - drones, helicopters, etc. - to hunt down terrorists. It is almost as though these are being saved for some other day. Even as the security forces brace to carry out another Operation Sarp Vinash in Jammu, it is important that the security strategy be reviewed. Use Village Defence Councils but at least provide them with better weapons than outdated .303 rifles. Use the latest technologies available to gain an advantage over the terrorists and take them out with minimal loss of personnel. There is no chivalry in sacrificing our own forces because we want to convince the world that we fight like gentlemen against barbarians. Ensure that the insertion of new troops in Jammu is not by pulling out troops from Kashmir and reducing the pressure on terrorists in the Valley. Most of all, politicians and generals need to stop declaring premature victories and/or underestimating, downplaying the terrorist threat.

'If helpless people come ...': Mamata Banerjee's offer for shelter as Bangladesh crisis spirals,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/politics/if-helpless-people-come-mamata-banerjees-offer-for-shelter-as-bangladesh-crisis-spirals-12774065.html,Politics,"In the wake of escalating violence in Bangladesh, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee announced on Sunday that she would offer shelter to distressed individuals from the neighbouring country. Addressing the Martyrs' Day rally of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in Kolkata, Banerjee asserted her commitment to humanitarian aid, referencing the United Nations Resolution on refugees to justify her stance amid the severe law and order breakdown in Bangladesh over the past few days. Banerjee stated, ""I should not be speaking on the affairs of Bangladesh since that is a sovereign nation and whatever needs to be said on the issue is a subject matter of the Centre. But I can tell you this, if helpless people come knocking on the doors of Bengal, we will surely provide them shelter."" She added that the UN Resolution mandates accommodating refugees in regions adjacent to those experiencing turmoil, citing the example of Assamese people allowed to live in Alipurduar during the Bodo strife. She also assured cooperation to Bengal residents with relatives stuck due to the violence and extended assistance to Bangladeshis in Bengal facing difficulties returning home. Banerjee urged the people of West Bengal to exercise restraint and not be provoked by the situation in Bangladesh, expressing her solidarity with those affected by the violence. Soon after, the President of the BJP’s Bengal unit, Sukanta Majumdar, and junior union minister slammed Banerjee's comments, suggesting that matters involving foreign policy should be consulted with the Centre before making public statements. ""It’s true that we are all concerned about the current situation in Bangladesh over which Delhi is keeping a close watch. Our chief minister should not be voicing her opinions on matters involving our country’s foreign policies without first consulting the Centre,"" Majumdar said. Violence has escalated in Dhaka and other parts of Bangladesh over student protests demanding the reform of the quota system for government jobs. The protests aim to end a system that reserves up to 30 percent of government jobs for relatives of veterans from the 1971 war of independence against Pakistan. Additionally, Banerjee praised Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, who attended the rally, for his party's performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Uttar Pradesh. She criticised the central government, predicting its collapse soon and accusing it of misusing agencies to stay in power. Yadav echoed her sentiments, asserting that the current government in Delhi is not sustainable and will soon fall.

In an indication of the changing political scenario in the state ahead of assembly elections, MLA Atul Benke, a member of the Ajit Pawar camp, met Pawar senior at Shirur MP Amol Kolhe's residence in Pune earlier in the day. Recently, senior NCP leader and minister Chhagan Bhujbal had called on Sharad Pawar at his residence in Pune ostensibly seeking the veteran politician's intervention in dousing the quota fire triggered by OBC-Maratha tussle. Kinhalkar, who comes from Marathwada region, is the second prominent leader of BJP from Nanded to join the NCP (SP) after ex-Union Minister Suryakanta Patil who had also quit the saffron party to join the Sharad Pawar camp. Notably, Kinhalkar had earlier served as an MLA of Bhokar, which was until recently represented by former chief minister Ashok Chavan before he switched over to the BJP. The cross-overs come against the backdrop of the spectacular performance of opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi in recent Lok Sabha polls apparently at the expense of the ruling Mahayuti, especially BJP. Sharad Pawar, who a year ago struggled to keep the flock together after Ajit Pawar engineered a split in NCP, eventually emerged stronger with the NCP (SP) bagging 8 of 10 constituencies in parliamentary polls. Kinhalkar cited the ""changed character"" of the BJP as the reason behind jumping the ship and accused the saffron party of ""rashtradroh"". ""There is a big difference between the BJP I had joined and the BJP I am seeing today. They talk of nationalism, they talk about the people's issues, they also talk of irrigation, but their actions promote rashtradroh (treason), not rashtrahita,"" said Kinhalkar while addressing an NCP (SP) rally in Pimpri-Chinchwad city which was attended by Sharad Pawar, Baramati MP Supriya Sule, and other senior leaders. Kinhalkar had served as the home minister when Pawar was chief minister of Maharashtra. State NCP (SP) president Jayant Patil alleged that 25 leaders from opposition parties facing corruption charges have joined the BJP, and investigation against 23 of them facing graft charges is abated. ""'Better to join the BJP than going to prison' is now the common slogan of the corrupt in Maharashtra,"" Patil said and accused the Mahayuti government of turning Maharashtra ""into the number 1 state for corruption in the country"". Sule alleged she had heard MPs in Parliament talking about their (BJP's) plan to change the Constitution after winning 400 seats in Lok Sabha polls. ""This is my accusation against the BJP. I heard MPs saying the constitution will be changed after bagging 400 seats. This is not a false narrative. You have heard it, the media has heard it,"" claimed Sule as she appealed to voters to restore Maharashtra's self-esteem and pride in the upcoming assembly elections. Bhokar assembly constituency, earlier represented by Kinhalkar, is part of the Nanded Lok Sabha constituency, wrested by the MVA from the BJP with Congress' Vasantrao Chavan defeating sitting MP Prataprao Chikhalikar by 60,000 votes in recent elections. With Suryakanta Patil and Kinhalkar on its side, the NCP (SP) is looking forward to strengthening the party's prospects in the Marathwada region, the epicentre of Maratha quota agitation, especially in Nanded, Hingoli, Parbhani, and Beed districts. The Vijay Sankalp Melava was strategically organised in Pimpri Chinchwad, considered a stronghold of Ajit Pawar when he was part of the undivided NCP. Kinhalkar's entry into the NCP (SP) comes a day ahead of the BJP convention scheduled to be held in Pune which will be addressed by Union Minister Amit Shah and Nitin Gadkari. In a jolt to Ajit, 28 functionaries from Pune district, including the Pimpri-Chinchwad unit's city president and two former corporators, quit the NCP led by him on Wednesday and joined the Sharad Pawar-led faction. Meanwhile, Junnar MLA Benke, who belongs to the Ajit Pawar-led camp, told reporters after meeting Sharad Pawar that ""anything can happen in politics"".

A communication from the LG office to the chief secretary on Friday said that Saxena expressed concern over the ""non-consumption"" of prescribed medical diet and medicines by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal lodged in Tihar jail under judicial custody and asked officers to find out its reasons from him. The communication, citing a report by Tihar Jail's Superintendent (Prison) regarding the health status of Kejriwal, noted that it brings out the fact that there are several instances of ""willful low-calorie intake"" by the chief minister, despite sufficient home-cooked food being provided to him. The report also claimed that Kejriwal refused to take insulin before dinner on July 7. The letter further intensified the political spat on the issue of Kejriwal's health in jail. AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh slammed the LG in a post expressing his disappointment on the claim. ""What kind of joke is this LG Sir? Would a man reduce his sugar levels at night? Which is very dangerous. LG Sir, if you do not know about the disease then you should not write such a letter,"" Singh said. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in a statement alleged that the ""BJP is hatching a sinister plan to kill Kejriwal."" Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva hit back at AAP, saying the report of the Tihar jail superintendent has ""exposed"" Kejriwal's ""conspiracy"" to gain ""sympathy"" by ""deliberately"" taking fewer calories of food and declining insulin to claim weight loss and high blood sugar level in jail. Senior AAP leader and Delhi minister Atishi claimed Kejriwal's sugar level has dipped below 50 mg/dL more than 8 times in jail and added, ""He may go into a coma and there is also a risk of brain stroke in such a situation."" Atishi also attacked the LG saying the communication from his office is ""very unfortunate"" and does not befit a constitutional head of the state. ""Does LG think that any person will deliberately make himself sick like this? This is a conspiracy of the Bharatiya Janata Party. They know that the longer he stays in jail, the more his health will keep deteriorating. ""So I would like to request LG Sahab that it does not suit him to make such comments on anyone's health,"" she said. The Delhi BJP president charged that Kejriwal has been taking less quantity of food from June 6 to July 13 to shed weight so that he could gain sympathy from the court and get bail. ""He campaigned hectically for 21 days, after getting bail from the court, during Lok Sabha polls and he had no health problems then. But, now he is trying to gain sympathy on the pretext of his health condition,"" Sachdeva charged. Kejriwal was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a money laundering case linked to the alleged excise policy scam, on March 21 and has been granted bail by the Supreme Court. , However, he is currently lodged in Tihar in a connected CBI case.

""The conflicts between allies are not new. While differences were kept under wraps during Yogi government 1.0, they have now surfaced publicly in government 2.0. Apna Dal (S) has been vocal in criticising the government's policies, while the state government has responded in an equally confrontational manner,"" said political analyst Manoj Bhadra. He said with the BJP pushed to the wall after its poor show in recent Lok Sabha elections, the allies are now flexing muscles and seeking their pound of flesh. The ongoing friction has led to speculation that Apna Dal (S) might sever its ties with the Yogi government. Questions arise about whether the party will continue its support from the outside if it parts ways with the state government. Given that Apna Dal (S) chief Anupriya Patel is a minister in the Modi government, there is also speculation about whether the BJP's national leadership will intervene. The conflict between Apna Dal (S) and the Yogi government began to intensify after the Lok Sabha elections, with experts pointing to the recruitment of 69,000 assistant teachers as a flashpoint. Apna Dal (S) leadership expressed dissatisfaction with the government's conduct during the elections, citing a lack of support from the government machinery. The issues of conflict: 1.      One of the major issues raised by Apna Dal (S) is the alleged non-compliance with reservation rules in the recruitment of these teachers. The party contends that SC and OBC candidates were not given their due reservations in the recruitment process, a dispute that remains unresolved despite the Yogi government's claims of adherence to reservation policies. 2.      Anupriya Patel escalated the matter by writing a letter to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on June 27, alleging that SC-ST and OBC reservation rules were being ignored in various government department recruitments. She claimed that positions meant for these categories were being filled by general category candidates under the pretext of unavailability of eligible candidates from reserved categories. The government, however, maintains that reservation rules are being strictly followed. 3.      Another significant dispute involved Ashish Patel, executive president of Apna Dal (S) and Technical Education Minister in the Yogi government, who clashed with principal secretary of the department, M. Devraj, over transfer decisions. Patel objected to Devraj's transfer actions, resulting in the transfer session being halted after the file was sent to the Chief Minister's office. Apna Dal (S) officials suspect that Devraj enjoys protection from higher government echelons. 4.      Further tensions were evident when Anupriya Patel publicly raised the issue of reservation once again during a programme in Lucknow commemorating the birth anniversary of Apna Dal (S) founder Sonelal Patel. She emphasized the need for SC-ST and OBC reservations in government department recruitments, a stance she was advised by state BJP leaders to discuss privately with top BJP leadership rather than on public platforms. 5.      Another point of contention was the installation of additional toll booths on the Varanasi-Shaktinagar road. Anupriya Patel objected to the establishment of toll plazas at Fattepur and Ahraura, arguing that they were only 20 kilometers apart, contrary to the NHAI rule that mandates a 40-kilometer distance between tolls. Industrial Development Minister Nandgopal Gupta Nandi dismissed her claims, stating that toll taxes were collected at only one place, and issued a press note to this effect. Political experts believe that Apna Dal (S) is engaging in pressure politics rather than seriously contemplating a split from the BJP. The party aims to signal to its voter base, particularly the backward classes, that it is championing their cause and can pressure the BJP when necessary. Anupriya Patel's statements are seen as attempts to reassure her vote bank and demonstrate that her party can advocate for their interests, even if it means creating friction with the BJP. Political analyst notes that Apna Dal feels the BJP has lost ground among backward and Dalit voters in the Lok Sabha elections. Although Apna Dal (S) itself is not particularly strong among these groups, as evidenced by Anupriya’s narrow electoral victory, her statements are meant to convey a message of solidarity to her vote bank. Similarly, senior journalist Rajesh N Bajpaee believes Apna Dal (S) is not in a position for a direct confrontation but seeks to leverage the BJP's current vulnerabilities. With Kurmi votes shifting away from the BJP in regions like Purvanchal and Awadh, Apna Dal (S) is maintaining pressure to extract concessions. Tripathi also speculates that internal factions within the BJP might be inciting Apna Dal (S) leadership. The unfolding political drama underscores the fragile nature of alliances in the current political landscape, highlighting the ongoing power dynamics and strategic maneuvering among key players in Uttar Pradesh.

Calling it 'Kejriwal ki 5 guarantee', the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) promised free electricity, free medical treatment, free education to people, Rs 1,000 per month to every woman in Haryana and employment for youngsters. Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann and senior AAP leaders Sanjay Singh and Sandeep Pathak were also present during the launch of 'Keriwal ki 5 guarantees' in Panchkula.

Promising free education for all in Haryana, AAP said, ""Like in Delhi and Punjab, the education mafia will be eradicated. Government schools will be made so good that people will want to enroll their children in government schools instead of private ones.

Kejriwal resorting to 'willful low calorie intake' in jail: Delhi LG in letter,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/kejriwal-resorting-to-willful-low-calorie-intake-in-jail-delhi-lg-in-letter-12773603.html,Politics,"Delhi Lt Governor VK Saxena has alleged that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who is lodged in Tihar jail under judicial custody, may deliberately not be taking the medical diet and medicines prescribed to him, according to a Raj Niwas communication. The LG in a letter to Chief Secretary Naresh Kumar cited a report by the Superintendent (Prison) regarding the health status of Kejriwal, to allege that there were several instances of ""willful low calorie intake"" by the CM, despite sufficient home-cooked food being provided to him. No reaction was immediately available from the AAP government on the development. The LG office said Saxena has suggested to the prison authorities that it may advise the CM to adhere to the prescribed dosage of medicine and insulin, apart from the diet specified since he has a history of Type-II Diabetes Mellitus. The Aam Aadmi Party has accused the BJP and its government at the Centre of ""conspiring"" to cause permanent damage to Kejriwal's health in jail and has claimed the leaders lost weight and suffered a fall in blood sugar level. The party has also claimed that Kejriwal could even have slipped into a coma and have brain damage after, it alleged, he suffered a drop in his blood sugar level up to 50 mg/dL five times in a night. According to the LG's letter to the Chief Secretary, the diet monitoring chart indicates that between June 6 and July 13, the CM did not fully consume the prescribed diet for all three meals of the day. ""The report also suggests loss of weight (now 61.5 kg which earlier was 63.5 Kg on the date of surrender - June 2, 2024). Prima facie, it appears to be due to less calorie intake,"" the letter read. Arvind Kejriwal’s health in danger: AAP; it’s all for bail, retorts BJP On June 18, insulin appears to have not been administered to him or was not recorded by the prison authorities in the report, it said. There are also significant variations between the glucometer test reading and the continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) reading on most days, said the LG office, adding, Kejriwal's glucometer reading prior to lunch was 104 mgl, while the CGMS reading done before lunch at 12.30 PM was 82 mgl on June 19. ""Glaring discrepancies between glucometer test readings and CGMS readings need to be verified by appropriate medical authorities,"" it said. According to the LG office, the CM did not consume the prescribed diet during all three meals on July 6. He was administered five units of insulin before breakfast, four units before lunch and two units before dinner, it said. The prescribed diet was again not consumed on July 7 and on that day five units of insulin was administered before breakfast, four units before lunch and ""insulin before dinner was refused by the CM,"" it said, citing the prison report.

During the call, Trump asserted that he would ""bring peace to the world"" and resolve the war that has led to significant loss of life and widespread devastation. Trump announced the call on Truth Social, describing it as a ""very good call."" Zelenskyy, who also condemned the recent assassination attempt on Trump, congratulated him on the successful Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. According to Trump, Zelenskyy remarked on the unity of the American people during these challenging times and expressed support for Trump's presidential bid. Trump stated, ""I appreciate President Zelenskyy for reaching out because I, as your next President of the United States, will bring peace to the world and end the war that has cost so many lives and devastated countless innocent families."" In a post on X, Zelenskyy described the conversation, stating, ""I wished him strength and absolute safety in the future."" He also noted the importance of bipartisan American support for Ukraine, emphasizing the critical role of U.S. assistance in defending the nation's freedom and independence. During a pre-election debate on June 27, Trump had claimed he could end the conflict before his inauguration on January 20, 2025. His comments have drawn mixed reactions, with concerns over the future of U.S. support for Ukraine as his campaign gains momentum and President Joe Biden's support appears to wane. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken addressed potential shifts in U.S. policy towards Ukraine during a fireside chat at the Aspen Media Forum. Blinken reassured that despite the possibility of policy changes, the U.S. has committed, along with over 20 other countries, to long-term support for Ukraine. ""We had more than 20 countries come together to announce that they had negotiated and signed 10-year bilateral security agreements with Ukraine,"" Blinken said. ""These are long-term commitments to Ukraine."" Blinken further emphasized that Russian President Vladimir Putin's goal to erase Ukraine's existence has ""failed"" and cannot succeed. In parallel, Zelenskyy made history as the first foreign leader to attend a British cabinet meeting in person since former U.S. President Bill Clinton in 1997. During his visit, Zelenskyy engaged with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and other European leaders, securing renewed pledges of support against Russian aggression. Starmer also vowed coordinated action against Russia's ""shadow fleet"" of tankers circumventing Western sanctions on Russian oil. The ongoing international dialogues underscore the global commitment to supporting Ukraine while navigating the complexities of international diplomacy and domestic political landscapes.

Rahul Gandhi behind Ram Vilas Paswan's UPA exit in 2014? Here's what son Chirag Paswan revealed,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/rahul-gandhi-behind-ram-vilas-paswans-upa-exit-in-2014-heres-what-son-chirag-paswan-revealed-12773355.html,Politics,"Union minister Chirag Paswan disclosed that it was due to Congress MP Rahul Gandhi that his father late Ram Vilas Paswan decided to leave the Congress-led UPA in 2014. ""Rahul Gandhi's refusal to meet him (father Ram Vilas) despite months of trying was one of the key reasons why we left the Congress-led UPA and allied with the BJP just before the 2014 elections,"" the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) president told news agency PTI. Recalling the old times, the LJP chief said that he, along with his father, used to meet Sonia Gandhi often to discuss the future of their party in the UPA. The former UPA chairperson suggested that Ram Vilas meet her son. ""My father sought an appointment and waited for more than three months but Rahul Gandhi did not relent,"" said Chirag Paswan, who at that time too was keen to leave the UPA and join the NDA. Ram Vilas Paswan, however, was still keen to remain in the UPA, and wanted to discuss about the party with Rahul Gandhi, the Union Minister of Food Processing Industries said. He added that till 2013, the party was in the UPA and his father was not ready to leave the alliance. ""He wanted to continue in that alliance and it was extremely difficult for me to convince him to change the alliance,"" said the junior Paswan noting that he preferred a tie-up with NDA due to his admiration and respect for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""It was good for me though. Had the meeting taken place, it would have been difficult for me to convince my father to join the BJP-led NDA,"" Chirag said. Chirag revealed that the Gandhi family scion was one of the key reasons why his party, then undivided and known as Lok Janshakti Party, quit the UPA in 2014. ""I think one of the reasons why my father left the UPA was because he could not meet Rahul ji. My father kept trying for a good three-four months to meet Rahul ji and not even a single meeting could take place. I think that was one of the reasons why my father was very upset. Despite being one of the senior leaders and an important ally in the UPA, he was not given time by Rahul Gandhi for a meeting,"" the LJP chief said. The decision of the senior Paswan, a leading grassroots Dalit leader who passed away in 2020, to break ranks with the UPA and tie up with the BJP was one of the headlines of the poll season in 2014 and helped the BJP build momentum and expand its alliance in an election where it rode the Modi wave to win its maiden majority in the Lok Sabha. Asked about his opinion of Rahul Gandhi, the Union minister told PTI that the Congress MP has of late begun taking his responsibility a bit more seriously. ""Rahul Gandhi showed a lot of reluctance in politics initially but has demonstrated signs of taking on more responsibility of late,"" Chirag said. He, however, criticised the LOP's speech in the Lok Sabha for the personal attacks on PM Modi and the Chair.

US: Robert Menendez conviction is a rare win against public corruption,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/us-robert-menendez-conviction-is-a-rare-win-against-public-corruption-12771988.html,Politics,"Tuesday’s conviction of Senator Robert Menendez shows that, despite recent trends at the US Supreme Court, some avenues remain open for prosecutors to hold public officials accountable for crimes. The New Jersey Democrat was convicted in federal court in Manhattan on all 16 counts in an indictment charging him with bribery, extortion, fraud, obstruction of justice and acting as an agent of a foreign government. Menendez has maintained his innocence and has said he will appeal. In recent years, the Supreme Court has cut back on the application of federal statutes to the conduct of public officials. As a former federal prosecutor, I find this trend concerning — particularly in a time when public confidence in government is particularly low. The Menendez conviction sends an important message that criminal prosecution remains a risk for officials who breach their duty of trust to the people they were elected to serve. Beginning in 1987, the court has issued several decisions curtailing the application of federal statutes to official misconduct. In McNally v. United States, the court gutted the concept of honest services fraud, a theory that when a government official performs an act on the job for a corrupt purpose, members of the public suffer even if they suffer no monetary loss. That case involved a state official in Kentucky named Gray (McNally was his co-defendant) who engaged in self-dealing by steering a government contract to an insurance agency that shared its commissions with another agency in which Gray had an undisclosed financial interest. Gray was convicted of fraud for depriving citizens of the right to have their affairs conducted honestly, despite the absence of evidence that the state had paid a higher rate for the insurance. The court reversed the convictions, finding that the mail fraud statute could not be violated based on the loss of intangible honest services. In the future, prosecutors would be required to show that the public lost money or property. Congress responded with a legislative fix, enacting a new statute making it a crime to engage in a “scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.” But that remedy did not last long. In 2010, the Supreme Court rejected an honest services theory in the Enron case. The court reversed the conviction of CEO Jeffrey Skilling, who was charged with deceiving investors by falsifying financial reports to enrich himself. The court held that honest services fraud could be used only in bribery or kickback schemes, and not in cases like Skilling’s, in which the defendant had engaged in “undisclosed self-dealing by taking action that furthered his own undisclosed financial interests while purporting to act in the interests of those to whom he owed a fiduciary duty.” Because Skilling did not accept bribes or kickbacks, the court reasoned, his conduct did not constitute honest services fraud. Although the Skilling case involved a private  business executive, the decision was broad enough to extend to public officials.  As for public officials, another blow to accountability came in 2016, when the court overturned the conviction of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell. A jury found that McDonnell and his wife had accepted gifts from the promoter of a dietary supplement. Although the McDonnells accepted $170,000 in gifts in exchange for setting up meetings and hosting a marketing event for the promoter at the governor’s mansion, the Supreme Court found that these acts were not “official acts” because they did not involve the formal exercise of government power. “To qualify as an ‘official act,’” the majority wrote, “the public official must make a decision or take an action on  question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy’ or agree to do so.” In other words, the conduct may have been “tawdry,” but it did not constitute bribery. In 2020, the justices carved away more criminal exposure for public officials, when it overturned the convictions in the scandal known as “Bridgegate,” involving aides to former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. A jury had found that the aides had closed lanes from Fort Lee, New Jersey, into Manhattan on the George Washington Bridge during rush hour, falsely claiming that they were performing a traffic study. In fact, the shutdown was political payback for the mayor of Fort Lee, who had declined to endorse Christie in his re-election campaign. The shutdown caused massive traffic jams. Even though the court found that the conduct constituted “deception, corruption” and “abuse of power,” it did not violate the federal statute because no financial loss occurred. Abusing power to solely to inflict revenge, the court found, was not a crime. And just last month, the court’s conservative majority held in United States v. Snyder that state and local officials cannot be convicted under the federal bribery statute for accepting gratuities, that is, a payment that occurs after the performance of a corrupt official act. In that case, the mayor of Portage, Indiana, had received $13,000 from a trucking company after helping award the company a $1.1 million contract. As Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson noted in her dissent, this “absurd and atextual reading of the statute is one only today’s Court could love.” That track record makes Tuesday’s conviction a refreshing reminder that public officials may still be held accountable for corrupt conduct — at least when the charges are as clear as those facing Menendez. The jury found that the senator engaged in old-fashioned quid-pro-quo bribery. That is, he accepted money and other things of value, such as gold bars and a Mercedes-Benz, in exchange for performing official acts. The jury also agreed that Menendez used his position as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to help businessmen and the governments of Egypt and Qatar obtain favorable treatment by the government, an egregious abuse of power. The case was certainly made all the more compelling when the FBI found more than $500,000 in cash and gold in Menendez’s home during an FBI search, some of it stuffed in envelopes and clothing . Menendez also made the path to conviction easier by obstructing justice , always a gift to prosecutors. Menendez was found guilty of conspiring to use his influence to scuttle state and federal criminal investigations of some of the bribe payers, a crime that requires no exchange of money. In addition, he was convicted of conspiring with co-defendants to lie to investigators about the nature of the bribe payments by calling them “loans,” and causing his lawyer to misrepresent facts about the case to federal prosecutors. After several decades in which public corruption laws have been weakened by the Supreme Court, his conviction case marks a significant victory for the public. We all deserve the honest services of the officials we elect to serve us in government. Let’s hope the Menendez case is a powerful deterrent to any public officials who need reminding that corruption is a serious crime.

Karnataka's Job Reservation Scheme: A recipe for Balkanization?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/karnatakas-job-reservation-scheme-a-recipe-for-balkanization-12771670.html,Politics,"The recent decision by the Karnataka government to introduce a bill reserving jobs for locals in the private sector is fraught with significant implications that are anti-India, anti-growth, anti-jobs, anti-innovation, and anti-social development. This policy mandates 50% reservation for administrative posts and 75% for non-administrative posts for Kannadigas, causing considerable concern among industry leaders. It is a dangerous gamble, threatening to shatter India's economic unity and social fabric. Let's dissect this policy and expose its flaws. From ‘Unity in Diversity’ to Divided States? India prides itself on being a land of unity despite its rich diversity. This proposal throws that ideal under the bus. By restricting movement and opportunity, Karnataka risks becoming an inward-looking island, stifling national integration. Remember Article 19? It guarantees free movement – a cornerstone of a unified India. This policy throws sand in its gears. Growth or Stagnation? The Choice is Karnataka's Imagine a thriving economy – capital, talent, and ideas flowing freely. 25% of State GDP is contributed by one sector – Tech. The affluence provided by this sector has spurred many other sectors making Karnataka one of the highest GST collecting states. Now imagine Karnataka throwing a wrench in that engine with job quotas. Companies thrive on a diverse talent pool. This policy cripples that advantage, leading to inefficiencies and a race to the bottom. Remember the Economic Survey? It's clear: flexible labor markets fuel economic success. Karnataka is on the path to becoming an economic backwater. Jobs? More Like Job Losses The stated aim is to create local jobs, but the reality could be a dystopian nightmare. Businesses burdened by red tape and compliance costs may simply say ""no"" to new hires. History is a harsh teacher. Look at Andhra Pradesh – similar quotas led to a hiring freeze and capital flight. Automation and outsourcing become tempting alternatives, leaving everyone worse off. And what is absolutely amazing is the first state which made a bold sales pitch appealing all industries of Karnataka to move base upon hearing the Bill announcement was the state of Andhra Pradesh. Thereby putting in public the hypocrisy in politics which only costs our youth their much deserved jobs. Us vs. Them: A Recipe for Social Unrest Job quotas breed resentment. Locals develop a sense of entitlement, while outsiders face discrimination. Maharashtra's experience is a stark warning – social tensions skyrocketed with their quota system. The same ensued when similar attempts were made in Haryana and Andhra Pradesh. Karnataka risks becoming a breeding ground for social unrest, jeopardizing the very progress it seeks. Killing Innovation Karnataka's quota bill isn't just misguided, it's a sledgehammer to the state's booming innovation engine. Diversity is the oxygen of progress,and this legislation chokes off the influx of fresh ideas and perspectives that fuel Bengaluru's reputation as a global tech powerhouse. Instead of nurturing a vibrant ecosystem, Karnataka risks breeding a stagnant, homogenous workforce incapable of groundbreaking innovation. The aftershocks won't be contained within state borders - the ripple effects could cripple India's position in the global tech race. Is this the legacy Karnataka wants to leave? Let's not repeat history's blunders. Andhra Pradesh's economic slowdown, Maharashtra's social strife, and Haryana's legal battles – these are cautionary tales. Karnataka can choose a different path. The Path Forward: A Brighter Karnataka * Skill Up, Don't Shut Out: Invest in education and training to make Kannadiga youth competitive, not just protected. * Incentivize, Don't Mandate: Attract businesses with tax breaks and grants for hiring locals, not quotas. * Embrace Inclusion: Promote equal opportunity for all. Karnataka's success hinges on a diverse, talented workforce. * Partner with Industry: Work with businesses to find solutions that benefit everyone, not just a select few. * The Law is Clear: Ensure any policy complies with the Constitution and fundamental rights. Legal challenges are a recipe for chaos. The Karnataka job reservation bill, though well-intentioned, poses several risks that could hamper the state’s and nation’s economic and social development. A balanced approach that includes investing in local skill development, improving education and training infrastructure, and fostering a business-friendly environment would be more effective. Such measures can ensure that local communities benefit from economic growth without compromising on merit, innovation, and social cohesion. By prioritizing inclusive growth and equal opportunity, Karnataka can continue to be a beacon of progress and prosperity. The author is Co-Founder, TeamLease & Independent Board Director.

The multinational engaged in EPC projects, Hi-tech manufacturing and services is expected to deliver positive results on a year-on-year (YoY) basis, primarily due to sales growth, robust wins in construction, power T&D and Hydrocarbons.

Capital Gains Tax: Why fix something that ain’t broke,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/budget/capital-gains-tax-why-fix-something-that-aint-broke-12774815.html,Market,"By Tushar Pradhan, Director at Hxgon Partners LLP The first full budget of the third term of the BJP government and the first of the coalition government is the subject of much debate already. There are various wishlists that industry bodies, corporates and individuals have prepared and are keenly looking at the fine print at the incoming budget. While it is a full budget, as opposed to an interim budget going into the elections in February, it will also be pertinent to note that in view of only a part of the year now being covered the government may decide to keep the policy oriented and major announcements for next February. Having said that, certain headlines point to some very sensitive issues especially connected to the capital markets, that have grabbed attention lately. While much of the speculation should rightfully border around the overall growth orientation, revenue maximisation and social equity addressed in the budget as main thrusts, the more controversial issue is the one relating to capital gains tax. There is speculation that there may be a change in the rate, or the holding period to determine short or long term for investments in equity and equity related instruments. Such a change if enacted may have an outsized impact on the market as sentiment in the short term is more impactful than the actual outcome. Also read: Economic Survey pegs FY25 GDP growth at 6.5-7% It will be interesting to note the reason why differential tax rates exists between income tax rates and capital gains tax in the first place. In a country that was starved of investment from its own public, the challenge was for providing capital for its growing industrial infrastructure needs by way of incentivising longer term investments by providing a tax arbitrage. If investors are willing to put their savings to work for a longer term, they should be adequately compensated for such allocation that not only satisfies the need for capital formation without additional outlay by the government or its agencies but also provides for a healthy return for deferring the outcome to investors. The capital gains tax globally also follows a similar pattern. For example, in the US, the long-term capital gains tax rates for the 2023 and 2024 tax years are 0%, 15%, or 20% of the profit, depending on the income of the filer. Please note, lower income filers get the benefit of zero capital gains tax there. Click Here To Read All Budget Related News This debate that these tax rates confer some undeserved advantage to investors while the employed majority is paying a higher tax rate is erroneous. The twin advantages of capital formation, employment of private capital for longer term usage is a needed measure for the government to see a lighter load on itself to provide the same. The short-term capital gains tax also is set higher to discourage speculation. Having increased the LTCG from zero to 10 percent and introducing differential rates for debt mutual funds and elongating the term for defining such gains, the government has already done its bit to disincentivise such investments to a certain degree. To change this picture for the worse will be sheer folly. This kind of signaling will sour investor sentiment and the booming equity cult that has recently formed will thus die a premature death. India needs long term investments, and such investments need the support of the government. Investments are not without risk and the just reward for patience is by way of such differential rates and in the larger interest should remain as status quo. After all, don’t fix it if it ain’t broke! Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"Implied Volatility may drop after Budget, analysts suggest an Iron Fly strategy",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/union-budget-implied-volatility-iron-fly-strategy-12774711.html,Market,"Benchmark Nifty 50 is trading in a narrow range with volatility being noticed around 24,500 level, and India VIX - the fear index - rising by 3 percent to 15 levels ahead of tomorrow's Union Budget announcement. According to Avani Bhatt, Vice President of Derivative Research at JM Financial, ""From here on, price moves are expected to be more rationalized and range-bound. India VIX is expected to gradually cool off to the 11-13 percent range in the August series."" Avani adds, ""A lot of factors have changed on the economic, political, and sentiment fronts from the period of the interim budget to the final budget, leading to a high probability of a more accommodative and populist budget. Markets have factored in this scenario and seen a very good recovery of nearly 15% on Nifty from the panic lows of National Election Day.""

The maximum profit occurs if the underlying asset's price remains near the strike price of the sold options, while losses are capped due to the protective positions of the purchased options.

Low float companies: Why these should be on the government’s divestment list,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/low-float-companies-why-these-should-be-on-the-governments-divestment-list-12774795.html,Market,"By Varun Lohchab, Head of Institutional Research at HDFC Securities The BSE PSU Index has doubled in the last one year as PSU stocks have been witnessing unprecedented rerating reflecting investors’ confidence on government strategy of bringing investment-led growth in the country. In our view, this is a suitable time for the government to capitalise on the market optimism and monetise its stake in certain low-float PSU stocks. Out of 73 listed public sector entities, government shareholding is more than 75 percent for 16 of them. These are low-float PSUs with poor liquidity and sub-optimal price discovery, which leads to a mismatch between supply and demand resulting in overblown stock prices even with modest buying activity. As per our analysis, total market capitalisation of these sixteen companies is around Rs 14 lakh crore. Hypothetically, if the government were to divest stake in these companies and bring their holdings down to 75 percent, it could fetch them Rs 2.58 lakh crore, which would be potent enough to reduce estimated FY25 fiscal deficit of India by 15 percent (or 78 bps of FY25E GDP). This can prove to be a catalyst in achieving the government’s ambitious fiscal deficit target of 4.5 percent by FY26. Furthermore, this will help lift sovereign rating of the country. Apart from reducing the fiscal deficit, the proceeds can also prove to be instrumental in supporting the ongoing infrastructure creation drive of the government or launching social welfare programs for rural Indians. Click Here To Read All Budget Related News Looking from the other perspective, this divestment will help in better price discovery and liquidity improvement of these low-float stocks which will reduce volatility in their prices. A stable price regime will attract more long-term institutional money, which will provide the underlying company the flexibility to implement its growth strategies. Eventually, growth in such companies will benefit the government in the long run in the form of increased dividends, taxes, and appreciation in the holding value. Within PSU stocks with more than 75 percent government holding, two insurance stocks namely LIC and GIC have approximately doubled in the last twelve months. In addition, Nifty PSU Bank Index has tripled in the last three years. Also, the financial health of these companies has drastically improved as well. In such a scenario, when, valuation and fundamentals both are in favour for these PSU companies, it is an appropriate time for divestment. As the government has missed its divestment targets for last four years consecutively, it makes all the sense to take advantage of current euphoric optimism around PSU stocks and monetise its stake in various companies. Furthermore, some planned strategic sales in companies such as IDBI Bank, Shipping corporation, Container corporation, BEML and NMDC steel, which got delayed due to subdued market conditions earlier, could take place comfortably in the current conducive environment. Also read: Expenditure on education grew at CAGR 9.4%: Economic Survey 2024 We believe, in the current context, challenges faced by the government in its earlier attempts of PSU divestments in past can be suitably addressed. For example, the wide apprehension of past years that large PSU divestments may result into crowding out of the private sector isn’t a significant fear currently, given salience of strong domestic flows. Further, with respect to divestment, another concern has been that the equity dilution of government stake in PSUs in favour of foreign entities may result into a decline in national wealth. However, in the current scenario, the domestic market is well developed and deep that a planned periodic equity sale by PSU companies can be easily absorbed by domestic institutions and wealthy individual investors. Hence, it can ensure that there is no overseas migration of national wealth. Also, partial divestment of government stake doesn’t take away its economic power over the governance of the company, hence welfare of the employees is also not compromised. Also read: Economic Survey pegs FY25 GDP growth at 6.5-7% Hence, overall, we believe partial divestment of low-float public sector companies is appropriate in the current context and has the potential to bring efficiency, better/ethical management practices, governance, and improved monitoring for the involved companies. Additionally, the sale proceeds will go a long way in improving the country’s financial health.

"HUL's Q1 results seen muted, eye on segmental sales and heatwave impact",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/hindustan-unilever-fmcg-profit-price-cut-12774554.html,Market,"The intense heatwave, price cuts and stable commodity prices are expected to support FMCG giant Hindustan Unilever post a flat quarter of earnings on July 23, according to analysts who track the company closely. According to a Moneycontrol poll of nine brokerages, Hindustan Unilever is likely to report a flat revenue growth, higher by one percent on-year at Rs 15,205 crore. Net profit is likely to come in at Rs 2,512 crore versus Rs 2,500 crore seen in the corresponding quarter last year.  Earnings estimates of analysts polled by Moneycontrol are in a narrow range, and any positive or negative surprise may trigger a sharp reaction in the stock. The most optimistic estimate sees India’s largest consumer staples firm HUL’s net profit jumping five percent on-year, but the most pessimistic projection suggests that net profit might sink five percent, such has been the divergence. Factors Impacting the Earnings HUL's revenue is likely to remain flat on account of subdued performance across categories, mainly impacted by price cuts, said Axis Securities. Volume Growth: The overall demand for HUL's products is seen muted in Q1FY25, with underlying volume growth seen in single-digits, according to brokerages. However, volumes in 75 percent of HUL’s business are growing. The FMCG major is likely to boost its volume growth in FY25 and FY26, said Motilal Oswal. Segmental Performance: Across segments, the performance is likely to vary with HUL's home care business likely growing at two percent, while beauty and personal care revenue expected to fall because of price cuts. HUL's Food portfolio, especially tea, coffee, and functional nutrition drinks, may be affected by a tough summer. Prabhudas Lilladher said, “We expect strong performance in Laundry while OOH consumption and hot beverages might be weak.” EBITDA margins: While gross margins are expected to expand in the range of 120-160 basis points, while HUL’s EBITDA margin is likely to contract by 10 basis points due to higher advertisement spends, royalty payout, and the termination of GSK consignment sale.

F&O minimum lot size should be increased to deter casual retail investors: Experts,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/fo-minimum-lot-size-should-be-increased-to-deter-casual-retail-investors-experts-12774492.html,Market,"Increasing the minimum lot size for futures and options (F&O) contracts would be an ideal way to cool the unbridled speculation by amateur retail traders in the equity derivatives segment, said market experts during a panel discussion on CNBC-TV18. Earlier this month, Moneycontrol had reported that the Working Committee on Futures and Options has recommended increasing the minimum lot size of derivative contracts to Rs 20 lakh-Rs 30 lakh from Rs 5 lakh presently. Deepak Shenoy of Capital Minds believes that F&O lot sizes have not increased in sync with GDP and market growth. According to Shenoy, ""Having a Rs 20 lakh lot size would be appropriate."" Shenoy also suggested reducing the number of expiries to one per week. At present, there is a weekly contract expiry on every day of the week. Rajesh Baheti from Crosseas Capital proposed a targeted approach to reduce retail participation in F&O trading. ""Steps should be targeted only at the retail segment and not damage the overall market sentiment. Market lot size adjustment would be the best way of addressing retail speculation,"" said Baheti. Last week, SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch said the regulator was compelled to warn against speculative bets in the futures and options (F&O) segment because it has become a ""macro issue"". Speaking at an event organised by SBI Mutual Fund, the regulator said the shift from savings to “speculative” activity was affecting the broader economy now. A good chunk of household financial savings are going into the speculative bets, depriving the real economy of much needed capital. In addition, youngsters were losing tonnes of money on such bets, Buch said. Speaking in the same discussion, Jimit Modi of Samco Securities quoted NSE data showing 4.0-4.5 million individuals participating in the options segment.

Speculative trading has no place in a developing country like India: Economic Survey,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/f-investors-may-face-serious-losses-warns-economic-survey-12774645.html,Market,"The Economic Survey has come down heavily on rising futures & options in the stock market by retail investors, using harshest words yet by a government agency, going as far to say that such speculative trading has “no place in a developing country” such as India. More importantly, it has warned the that any potential fall in stock markets could make investors feel cheated and deter them from returning to capital markets for a long time which could be detrimental to the entire economy. The Survey noted that derivatives trading, with its potential for outsized gains, often appeals to the human instinct for gambling and the allure of augmenting income. This dynamic has driven significant retail participation in derivatives trading. However, the reality of derivatives trading is starkly different from its promise. ""Globally, derivatives trading loses money for investors, for the most part,"" the survey states. The allure of quick profits can be misleading, as the majority of participants in derivatives markets end up facing losses. This underscores the importance of raising investor awareness and continuous financial education. The survey emphasizes, ""Raising investor awareness and continuous financial education is essential to warn them of the low or negative expected returns from derivatives trading."" Also read | F&O crackdown: Panel suggests sweeping curbs on options contracts, lot sizes The risks associated with derivatives trading are not merely theoretical. A significant stock market correction can lead to substantial losses, particularly for retail investors engaged in derivatives. These losses could provoke a strong negative behavioral response, with investors feeling ""cheated by unseen more considerable forces."" The Economic Survey warns that such experiences could deter retail investors from returning to capital markets for a long time, which would be detrimental to both their financial well-being and the broader economy. The Economic Survey also provides a broader context for understanding the potential pitfalls of rapid financialisation. It points to historical precedents, noting, ""The financialisation of economies has not ended well, even for advanced economies. The global financial crisis of 2008 is an obvious example."" For developing countries, the risks are even more pronounced. The survey cites the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98, which severely impacted the high-flying economies of the region. These examples illustrate the dangers when financial market innovations and growth outpace economic growth. Also read | F&O frenzy in equities now turning into a stampede, warns Vijay Kedia For India, the survey advocates for a cautious approach: ""India needs to have an orderly and gradual evolution of the financial market."" Such an approach is essential to avoid the destabilizing effects that have plagued other economies. The survey calls on all stakeholders, including market participants, market infrastructure institutions, regulators, and the government, to ensure that capital markets fulfill their fundamental role of directing savings to productive investments. This is not only a matter of national interest but also of self-interest. The survey concludes, ""All stakeholders must ensure that capital markets play their theoretically assigned role of directing savings to their most productive investments. It is not just in the national interest. It is an act of self-interest, too."" Earlier this month, Moneycontrol reported that a SEBI working committee on F&O has proposed measures to curb the rapid growth in derivatives volume. These include increasing the minimum lot size of derivative contracts to Rs 20 lakh-Rs 30 lakh from the current Rs 5 lakh, restricting weekly options to one expiry per stock exchange per week, and limiting the number of strike prices for options contracts. Last week, SEBI chairperson Buch said that the worry for the regulator is now not just from a “micro level” of the F&O trading putting investors at risk, but also from a “macro level” of it disrupting economic growth. Buch said that turnover in index options in premium terms has gone up from Rs 4.5 lakh crore in 2018 to Rs 140 lakh crore in 2024. While overall turnover in the derivatives segment has gone up from Rs 210 lakh crore in 2018 to Rs 500 lakh crore in 2024.

Chemical players bet on hopes of PLI to give manufacturing boost,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/chemical-players-bet-on-hopes-of-pli-to-give-manufacturing-boost-12774551.html,Market,"Even though the sector is caught in the midst of a rough patch, chemical companies are hoping for finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will give the industry something to cheer on in the form of production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme in the upcoming Budget. The industry has been grappling with weak demand and an influx of low-cost Chinese inventory in global markets over the past year. A recovery seems imminent, except in agrochemicals, where the outlook remains unclear. Many analysts predict that a rebound should start becoming visible by the second half of this fiscal year. The industry is also counting on government support to maximise this revival. Axis Securities anticipates continued backing through the PLI scheme for chemicals and other tax incentives in chemical manufacturing hubs like Gujarat, benefiting multiple Indian chemical manufacturers. Additionally, analysts Mayank Maheshwari and Vivek Rajamani of Morgan Stanley expect incentives for petrochemicals and the growth of green hydrogen and gas penetration. With the rising demand for electric vehicles (EVs), Axis Securities foresees additional PLI incentives for battery manufacturers and companies involved in electric power production and storage. Prabhudas Lilladher hopes for a government roadmap for renewable manufacturing and higher ethanol blending. For the agrochemical sector, there are expectations that customs duty on imports could be doubled to 20 percent on technicals and 30 percent on formulations, benefiting domestic producers. However, Nuvama analysts see little chance of duty slabs being altered. Also Read | Budget 2024: Pharma firms hope for increased expenditure for healthcare, support for R&D The chemical industry was thriving until 2022, when global demand weakened, and Chinese imports flooded international markets. This downturn coincided with a phase of capital expenditure commissioned by most domestic players, putting margins under severe pressure. Consequently, most brokerages have adopted a cautious stance on the sector. Several chemical stocks, such as SRF, Deepak Nitrite, Gujarat Fluorochemicals, Neogen Chemicals, PI Industries, and Himadri Specialty Chemicals, have are also down in the red year-to-date. Despite this, some signs of recovery are emerging, with a significant rebound in demand expected later this fiscal year. In this context, government support through PLI schemes will be crucial in lifting sentiment for the sector as it moves toward a demand revival.

She was speaking at an event organised by SBI MF on July 19 to mark its assets under management (AUM) crossing Rs 10 trillion. Buch said that during times when SEBI needed to request government intervention, such as establishing a backstop facility for mutual funds in crisis situations, SBI Mutual Fund was the clear choice to manage these initiatives. Also read: Does your heart beat for the customer, Sebi chief asks mutual fund distributors ""When we wanted to request the government to provide a backstop facility for mutual funds in the event of another crisis and when we wanted to institutionalise it, the simple question was, who will run this? We have said it without any hesitation, SBI MF will run it, who else will run it?"" Buch recounted. ""SBI Mutual Fund has a very special place for the regulator (in that respect). And there are many other instances less publicly known, where again, SEBI relies or has relied on the broad shoulders of SBI Mutual Fund to do in its own way a part of the tremendous responsibility that is cast on us as a regulator,"" she said adding that this was a testament to the culture of the bank, which has manifested in the subsidiary. Buch also praised the culture of the bank, which has manifested in its subsidiary, and thanked every member of the SBI Mutual Fund ""family"" for their support and service with the words, “Tahe dil se shukriya aada karte hai.” (I thank you from the bottom of my heart) Buch added that over the last year, every time she spoke about mutual funds as a product for financial inclusion in the capital markets, and how they want to make micro SIPs and the 250-rupee SIP popular, she knew SBI would be at the forefront.  “I knew that SBI MF is the one mutual fund that can do it”. Buch also praised the fund house for the role it has been playing in ensuring the stability and integrity of India's financial markets. ""By stepping up during times of potential crisis, the fund not only supports the regulator but also bolsters investor confidence, reflecting the strong partnership between SEBI and SBI Mutual Fund in maintaining the robustness of the mutual fund industry,"" she said. Answering a query on whether there is a need for distributors of a particular AMC to sell products of all AMCs, Buch noted: ""A large number of funds with common benchmarks and categories exhibit similar performance. If an entity decides to sell only its group’s funds within this space, it should not be an issue. Different organizations have different strengths. For instance, Motilal Oswal is known for its strong equity brand. If SBI has a strong distribution network, why should they not use it? There is nothing wrong with that."" However, Buch added that selling underperforming funds is mis-selling. ""The system must ensure that this does not happen. I am confident that the SBI group takes care of this issue well,"" she said.

While the Street is not anticipating an increase in the subsidy bill, industry participants are expecting the finance minister may retain the previously estimated subsidy allocation.

Follow our live blog for all the updates Experts are anticipating greater emphasis on boosting rural consumption, primarily through higher spending on government’s flagship programmes. A rebound in rural consumption should benefit fertiliser companies, as it would likely lead to increased spending by farmers on crop protection.

Nomura has a ‘buy’ call on Reliance Industries stock, with a price target of Rs 3,600, implying about a 16 percent upside from the last closing price. Nomura analysts said Reliance’s O2C (oil-to-chemicals) business “delivered well in a challenging environment”. They also said that the operational trends remain strong for Reliance Industries, citing the rise of 20 basis points in overall margins year-on-year. On July 19, Reliance Industries reported an 11.5 per cent increase in revenue to Rs 2.58 lakh crore in the first quarter of the current fiscal from a year ago, bolstered by contributions across segments. Consolidated EBITDA rose 2 percent from the year-ago period to Rs 42,748 crore. However, the O2C business EBITDA declined.

Jio Platforms’ revenue from operations rose 12.8 percent from a year earlier to Rs 29,449 crore in the quarter ended June 30. The segment’s EBITDA increased to Rs 14,638 crore.

The energy and telecom segments should see a rebound in coming quarters, Morgan Stanley said. Reliance’s retail business revenue grew by 6.6 percent, and EBITDA rose to Rs 5,664 crore. “The management is rationalising unprofitable parts in retail with a focus on margins,” Jefferies said. Reliance’s pivot in retail to focus on margin amid weak domestic demand stands out, Morgan Stanley said. Macquarie has a ‘neutral’ call on Reliance Industries stock, with a target price of Rs 2,750 per share. The company’s follow-through on capex discipline and free cash flow improvement would be positive. RIL’s capital expenditure for the quarter stood at Rs 28,785 crore, comfortably covered by a cash profit of Rs 33,757 crore. Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

"Implied Volatility may drop after Budget, analysts suggest an Iron Fly strategy",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/union-budget-implied-volatility-iron-fly-strategy-12774711.html,Stocks,"Benchmark Nifty 50 is trading in a narrow range with volatility being noticed around 24,500 level, and India VIX - the fear index - rising by 3 percent to 15 levels ahead of tomorrow's Union Budget announcement. According to Avani Bhatt, Vice President of Derivative Research at JM Financial, ""From here on, price moves are expected to be more rationalized and range-bound. India VIX is expected to gradually cool off to the 11-13 percent range in the August series."" Avani adds, ""A lot of factors have changed on the economic, political, and sentiment fronts from the period of the interim budget to the final budget, leading to a high probability of a more accommodative and populist budget. Markets have factored in this scenario and seen a very good recovery of nearly 15% on Nifty from the panic lows of National Election Day."" In context of this view, Bhatt recommends an Iron Fly strategy for the 29th August monthly expiry: Strategy for 29th August expiry: - Sell 24500 CE at Rs 530-540- Sell 24500 PE at Rs 380-390- (Combined premium of 910-930) - Buy 25400 CE at Rs 150-160- Buy 23600 PE at Rs 130-140 Net Premium Inflow: 630-650 Margin Required: Approx Rs 53,000 Target: 500 pointsStop Loss: 250 points  About Short Iron Fly: It is an advanced options strategy that involves selling an at-the-money call and put (forming a straddle) and buying an out-of-the-money call and put (forming wings). This strategy is designed to profit from low volatility and the passage of time, aiming to capture the premium received from selling the straddle while limiting potential losses with the wings. The maximum profit occurs if the underlying asset's price remains near the strike price of the sold options, while losses are capped due to the protective positions of the purchased options.

F&O minimum lot size should be increased to deter casual retail investors: Experts,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/fo-minimum-lot-size-should-be-increased-to-deter-casual-retail-investors-experts-12774492.html,Stocks,"Increasing the minimum lot size for futures and options (F&O) contracts would be an ideal way to cool the unbridled speculation by amateur retail traders in the equity derivatives segment, said market experts during a panel discussion on CNBC-TV18. Earlier this month, Moneycontrol had reported that the Working Committee on Futures and Options has recommended increasing the minimum lot size of derivative contracts to Rs 20 lakh-Rs 30 lakh from Rs 5 lakh presently. Deepak Shenoy of Capital Minds believes that F&O lot sizes have not increased in sync with GDP and market growth. According to Shenoy, ""Having a Rs 20 lakh lot size would be appropriate."" Shenoy also suggested reducing the number of expiries to one per week. At present, there is a weekly contract expiry on every day of the week. Rajesh Baheti from Crosseas Capital proposed a targeted approach to reduce retail participation in F&O trading. ""Steps should be targeted only at the retail segment and not damage the overall market sentiment. Market lot size adjustment would be the best way of addressing retail speculation,"" said Baheti. Last week, SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch said the regulator was compelled to warn against speculative bets in the futures and options (F&O) segment because it has become a ""macro issue"". Speaking at an event organised by SBI Mutual Fund, the regulator said the shift from savings to “speculative” activity was affecting the broader economy now. A good chunk of household financial savings are going into the speculative bets, depriving the real economy of much needed capital. In addition, youngsters were losing tonnes of money on such bets, Buch said. Speaking in the same discussion, Jimit Modi of Samco Securities quoted NSE data showing 4.0-4.5 million individuals participating in the options segment.

Fertiliser stocks surge up to 13% a day before Budget on hopes of rural focus,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/fertiliser-surge-subsidy-union-budget-12774354.html,Stocks,"Fertiliser stocks were buzzing in trade, surging as much as 13 percent, in the run-up to the Union Budget 2024 due to be tabled by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 23. The spike in fertiliser stocks came as investors speculate the quantum of subsidy that could be allotted to the sector in the upcoming budget. The interim budget had estimated the fertiliser subsidy requirement for FY25 at Rs 1.64 lakh crore, which is lower than Rs 1.89 lakh crore for FY24. While the Street is not anticipating an increase in the subsidy bill, industry participants are expecting the finance minister may retain the previously estimated subsidy allocation. ""While the budgeted amount is considered to be adequate for FY25 due to moderation in input costs and prices of finished products, the reduced subsidy bill (as compared to FY24) will enable the government to allocate funds to more productive areas,"" Axis Securities wrote in a note. Brokerage expects the government to increase funding towards reducing dependence on fertiliser imports and developing new capabilities such as nano urea. Follow our live blog for all the updates Experts are anticipating greater emphasis on boosting rural consumption, primarily through higher spending on government’s flagship programmes. A rebound in rural consumption should benefit fertiliser companies, as it would likely lead to increased spending by farmers on crop protection. Riding high on these expectations, shares of Deepak Fertilisers, Chambal Fertilisers and Chemicals, National Fertilizers, Gujarat State Fertilizers, Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore (FACT),  and Coromandel International were trading 3-13 percent on the NSE. Fertiliser companies faced disappointing earnings in FY24 due to weak prices, subdued demand, and an influx of low-cost Chinese supplies into the global market. This led to a significant decline in profitability, straining both net profit and revenue of major players. However, signs of recovery have emerged in recent quarters, with expectations of a resurgence in demand in the latter half of the current fiscal, coinciding with the sowing of Rabi crop. In this backdrop, the fertilizer industry is relying on hopes of the government's support to stage a strong rebound later this fiscal.

Despite this, brokerages offered mixed opinions on the stock, citing uncertainty over the timeline for lifting the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) digital banking ban, keeping margin and loan growth outlook in check. The positives Morgan Stanley analysts issued an 'overweight' call for Kotak Mahindra Bank and increased the target price to Rs 2,300 per share from Rs 2,150, indicating a 30 percent upside from current levels. ""We observed significant one-time gains during the quarter with strong loan growth and controlled costs as key positives. At a 1.7x price-to-book (PB) ratio for FY26, we believe the risk-reward is attractive for Kotak Mahindra Bank,"" they stated.

They emphasised that the removal of the ban is critical for the bank to achieve sustainable growth and earnings.

While robust corporate growth boosted overall loan growth, it came at the expense of margins,"" the brokerage firm commented. JM Financial also issued a 'hold' rating and a target price of Rs 1,830. Analysts noted that key factors to monitor will be the trajectory of deposit growth, the sustenance of margins, and the ability to manage credit costs. ""Although the stock has largely recovered from the losses due to the RBI embargo, core momentum remains soft (lower NIMs and higher credit costs), making further valuation re-rating unlikely. We lower estimates by 12 percent for FY25 and FY26, factoring in lower NIMs, slightly higher credit costs, and the impact of the RBI embargo,"" the brokerage firm stated.

That compares with a 30,000-barrel decline forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll, and a drop of 4.4 million barrels in a report from the American Petroleum Institute trade group. [EIA/S] [API/S] On the demand side, the prospects of cuts in interest rates in coming months in the United States and Europe helped to support the market. Lower interest rates often spark buying and boost oil demand. Federal Reserve officials said on Wednesday the U.S. central bank is ""closer"" to cutting interest rates given inflation's improved trajectory and a labor market in better balance, possibly setting the stage for a reduction in borrowing costs in September. Also, U.S. economic activity expanded at a slight to modest pace from late May through early July with firms expecting slower growth ahead. The European Central Bank, meanwhile, is all but certain to keep interest rates unchanged on Thursday, but signaled that its next move is likely to be a cut. Investors are also awaiting policy news from a key leadership gathering in China that is to end on Thursday. The dollar eased on Thursday for a third straight session. A weaker dollar can boost demand for oil by making greenback-denominated commodities like oil cheaper for holders of other currencies.

Gold soars to record as US rate-cut bets burnish appeal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gold-soars-to-record-as-us-rate-cut-bets-burnish-appeal-12770875.html,Commodities,"Gold prices jumped to an all-time peak on Wednesday, driven by mounting hopes of a U.S. interest rate cut in September after recent comments from Federal Reserve officials. Spot gold was up 0.2% at $2,473.87 per ounce, as of 0250 GMT, after hitting a record peak of $2,482.29. U.S. gold futures gained 0.3% to $2,475.80. ""Gold reached a new high watermark as investors position for the arrival of a lower interest rate environment. The $2,500 (range) is the next immediate target, though if the current momentum can be sustained we could be looking at prices further north from here before year-end,"" said Tim Waterer, KCM Trade's chief market analyst. ""Particularly, if we start seeing some more favourable U.S. CPI prints, which could make the Fed more dovish on rates than is already priced in."" Markets are expecting a rate cut of at least 25 basis points by the Fed at September meeting. The allure of non-yielding bullion tends to be higher when interest rates are reduced. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Monday recent inflation readings ""add somewhat to confidence"" that the pace of price increases is returning to the Fed's target in a sustainable fashion, remarks that suggest a turn to rate cuts may not be far off. Fed Governor Adriana Kugler on Tuesday also expressed cautious optimism that inflation is returning to the U.S. central bank's 2% target. ""If (gold) prices retrace, $2,450 near its previous record high seems like a tempting level for bulls to reload for its next leg higher,"" City Index senior analyst Matt Simpson said. Top consumer China still has plenty of appetite for official gold purchases despite pausing in May and June, as its bullion holdings remain low as a share of reserves and geopolitical tensions persist, according to a policy insider, industry experts and data.

Oil prices steady as slowing demand offsets tightening supply,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/oil-prices-steady-as-slowing-demand-offsets-tightening-supply-12770844.html,Commodities,"Oil prices were steady in early Asian trade on Wednesday, with global benchmark Brent hovering near the one-month low it hit in the prior session, as signs of weakening demand growth in China clashed with the prospect of declining U.S. oil stockpiles. Brent crude oil futures fell by 11 cents, or 0.1%, to $83.62 a barrel by 0010 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were also 11 cents, or 0.1%, lower at $80.65 a barrel. Both benchmarks have dropped in the three prior sessions, with Brent crude futures trading as low as $83.30 on Tuesday, the lowest since June 17. Concerns over demand in China continue to weigh on sentiment, ANZ Bank analyst Daniel Hynes wrote. The top oil importer's economy grew 4.7% in the second quarter, official data showed earlier this week, the slowest growth since the first quarter of 2023. A stronger U.S. dollar has also weighed on oil prices, Hynes wrote. The dollar index was slightly higher for a third consecutive session on Wednesday, making oil more expensive for investors holding other currencies. The demand concerns and dollar strength offset signs of tightening supply in the United States, the world's largest oil producer and consumer. U.S. crude oil inventories fell by 4.4 million barrels in the week ended July 12, market sources said on Wednesday citing data from the American Petroleum Institute. Analysts polled by Reuters were estimating crude stocks to fall by 33,000 barrels. The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its official storage report at 1430 GMT. Meanwhile rising geopolitical risk is helping limit oil price decline, Growmark Energy analysts said. A Liberia-flagged oil tanker was assessing damage and investigating a potential oil spill after it was attacked by Yemen's Houthis in the Red Sea, the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC) said on Tuesday.

Oil extends losses as dollar strengthens following Donald Trump attack,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/oil-extends-losses-as-dollar-strengthens-following-donald-trump-attack-12768986.html,Commodities,"Oil prices fell for a second day on Monday as the dollar gained ground amid political uncertainty in the U.S. following an attack on U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump while investors eyed the progress of talks for a Gaza ceasefire. Brent crude futures fell 55 cents, or 0.7%, to $84.48 a barrel by 0109 GMT after settling down 37 cents on Friday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was at $81.65 a barrel, down 56 cents, or 0.7%. The dollar firmed on Monday while U.S. bond futures slipped as investors wagered the attack on Trump made his victory in the upcoming presidential election more likely. [MKTS/GLOB] ""The (U.S. dollar) is expected to be a beneficiary of the assassination attempt on former President Trump as it increases the chances of his re-election,"" said IG market analyst Tony Sycamore. A stronger dollar tends to lower oil prices as buyers using other currencies have to pay more for their dollar-denominated crude. Last week, Brent fell more than 1.7% after four weeks of gains while WTI futures slid 1.1% as weak oil demand in China, the world's top importer, countered robust summer consumption in the U.S. China's crude oil imports fell 2.3% in the first half of this year to 11.05 million barrels per day amid disappointing fuel demand and as independent refiners reduced production due to weak profit margins. The country is expected to release data on Monday showing that its economy likely slowed in the second quarter as a protracted property downturn and job insecurity weighed on domestic demand, keeping alive expectations Beijing will need to unleash more stimulus. In the Middle East, talks on ending the Gaza conflict between Israel and Hamas halted on Saturday after three days, though a Hamas official said on Sunday it has not withdrawn from discussions. At the same time, an Israeli attack targeting the group's military leader killed 90 people on Saturday. The uncertainty around the volatile situation has kept the geopolitical premium in oil elevated. The U.S. active oil rig count, an early indicator of future output, fell by one to 478 last week, the lowest since December 2021, energy services firm Baker Hughes reported on Friday.

Fed Chair Powell, in his testimony, acknowledged the cooling labour market and progress in controlling inflation, emphasizing that the central bank does not require inflation to drop below 2 percent before considering rate cuts. Meanwhile, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly expects further easing in price pressures and the labour market, supporting the case for rate cuts. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee believes the US economy is on track to achieve 2 percent inflation. US headline inflation slowed more than expected to a one-year low of 3 percent in June, while the annual core measure dropped to a three-year low of 3.3 percent, prompting US equities to reach new record highs and pushing the US dollar to a five-week low of 104.04. COMEX Gold prices jumped to $2422 per troy ounce, as signs of softness in the labour market and ongoing disinflationary trends improved the conviction that the Fed might pivot to rate cuts soon, sending 2-year and 10-year treasury yields to the lowest since March. On the four hourly charts, MCX Gold (Aug) has given an upward breakout of its ‘Double Bottom’ chart pattern affirming bullish control. In addition, on the daily chart, the price has closed above its previous swing high of Rs 73,149 per 10 grams. Next resistance for the counter is placed at Rs 73,780 above which major resistance is placed at Rs 74,400. Silver gained momentum with Gold, surpassing the $32 per troy ounce mark but closed the week 1 percent lower near $31 per troy ounce owing to weakness in base metals. LME base metals faced pressure due to subdued market expectations regarding a policy shift from the Third Plenum coupled with lacklustre domestic demand highlighted in China's trade data. WTI Crude oil dipped below $81 per barrel earlier in the week as concerns about supply from Hurricane Beryl eased. However, oil prices rebounded sharply to $83.74 per barrel and nearly erased the weekly decline, supported by indications of improved fuel demand in the US during the summer travel season and expectations of an imminent Fed policy pivot. Furthermore, the EIA increased its 2024 demand estimate to 1.11 million barrels per day (bpd) from 1.08 million bpd, and OPEC maintained its strong oil demand growth forecast of 2.2 million bpd for 2024. In contrast, the IEA lowered its 2025 oil demand growth forecast to 980,000 bpd from 1 million bpd, citing weak consumption in China. Next week, US retail sales figures for June, expected to decline 0.3 percent month-over-month according to Bloomberg forecasts, are anticipated to reflect another month of weak spending due to slowing average hourly earnings growth and consumer caution. Additionally, the ECB policy meeting will be closely watched for hints on the timing of the next rate cut, although it is likely that policymakers will leave rates unchanged this month. Metals may continue to face pressure as key economic indicators from China are expected to underscore slowing activity. Most importantly, traders will closely watch China's once-in-five-years key political gathering (July 15 – 18) to see if the country addresses the persistent property crisis and cautious consumer spending, even though the event primarily focuses on longer-term political and economic reforms.

Brent futures rose 35 cents, or 0.4% to $85.43 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 36 cents, or 0.5%, to $82.47 a barrel. U.S. crude inventories fell by 3.4 million barrels to 445.1 million barrels in the week ended July 5, far exceeding analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1.3 million-barrel draw. Gasoline stocks fell by 2 million barrels to 229.7 million barrels, much bigger than the 600,000-barrel draw analysts expected during the U.S. Fourth of July holiday week. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries also stuck to its forecast for relatively strong growth in global oil demand in 2024 and next year, saying on Wednesday that resilient economic growth and air travel would support fuel use in the summer months. Gains were, however, capped as supply disruptions at refineries and offshore production facilities from hurricane Beryl were minimal. Meanwhile, U.S. inflation data due this week include the Consumer Price Index on Thursday and the Producer Price Index report on Friday, both of which could set the tone for the market. Expectations of a 25-basis-point rate cut by September ticked up to 74% from around 70% on Tuesday and 45% a month ago, according to CME's FedWatch. Lower interest rates decrease the cost of borrowing, which can boost economic activity and oil demand. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday the U.S. central bank will make interest rate decisions ""when and as"" they are needed, pushing back on a suggestion that a September rate cut could be seen as a political act ahead of the fall presidential election.

Gold rangebound with spotlight on US inflation reading,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gold-rangebound-with-spotlight-on-us-inflation-reading-12765690.html,Commodities,"Gold traded in a narrow price range on Wednesday as investors looked forward to a key U.S. inflation reading that could shed more light on the Federal Reserve's interest rates trajectory. Spot gold rose 0.2% to $2,367.79 per ounce by 0229 GMT. U.S. gold futures climbed 0.3% to $2,374.10. Fed Chair Jerome Powell in his testimony to the Senate said inflation had been improving in recent months and that ""more good data would strengthen"" the case for looser monetary policy. Powell will next speak before the House later in the day. ""With the recent run of weaker U.S. data, the case has been built around a September rate cut, but with the Fed Chair still wanting to see more good data, further inflation progress will be needed to offer more confidence for policymakers to open the door to rate cuts,"" said IG market strategist Yeap Jun Rong. Traders currently see a 73% chance of a rate cut in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool. Non-yielding bullion's appeal tends to shine when interest rates are lower. The June consumer price index (CPI) data, due on Thursday, is expected to show that headline prices rose 0.1% on the month, while core prices gained 0.2%. That would put annual gains at 3.1% and 3.4%, respectively. ""Any surprise resurgence in pricing pressures may challenge the Fed's inflation fight, which could raise calls for a delayed policy easing process. That may weigh on gold, which could see prices fall back towards the $2,300 level of support,"" Yeap said. Global physically backed gold exchange traded funds saw the second consecutive month of inflows in June due to additions to holdings by Europe- and Asia-listed funds, the World Gold Council said on Tuesday. Spot silver rose 0.3% to $30.89 per ounce, platinum steadied at $984.55 and palladium gained 0.1% to $981.37.

Brent futures rose 21 cents to $84.87 a barrel by 0055 GMT, after falling 1.3% in the previous session. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 26 cents to $81.67 a barrel, after falling 1.1% in the previous session. WTI has dropped 3% in the previous three sessions amid concerns about flagging global oil demand and as signs appeared that the Texas energy industry came off relatively unscathed from Hurricane Beryl after it hit the region on Monday. Brent is down 3.2% over the same period. U.S. crude oil and gasoline inventories fell last week, according to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute figures on Tuesday, indicating summer fuel demand is steady and driving the rebound after days of declines. The API figures showed crude stocks were down by 1.923 million barrels in the week ended July 5, the sources said. Gasoline inventories fell by 2.954 million barrels. However, distillate supply rose by 2.342 million barrels. Prices were also supported by comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that suggested the case for interest rate cuts is becoming stronger. Lower interest rates should spur more economic growth and therefore more oil consumption. Following Powell's comments investors continued to put a nearly 70% probability on a Fed rate cut in September. ""Powell's remarks to the Senate affirmed the improvement in data through the June quarter, while maintaining that more good data would boost confidence in the inflation outlook,"" ANZ analysts said in a note on Wednesday. The outlook for higher oil prices was also supported by a U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) report on Tuesday showing global oil demand will outpace supply next year, reversing a prior forecast for a surplus. In Texas, oil and gas companies restarted some operations on Tuesday after Hurricane Beryl lashed the state, while some facilities sustained damage and power had not been fully restored. Beryl's impact on oil and gas production was expected to be limited, and on Tuesday, some ports reopened and most producers and facilities were ramping up output. Investors are expecting official U.S. oil stocks data on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT) from the EIA.

The sowing of kharif crops has begun well as the southwest monsoon rainfall has picked up after a slow start. The above-normal rainfall so far in the season has boosted the acreage of key crops such as paddy, pulses and oilseeds from the previous year. The area under paddy, one of the main kharif crops, was up 19% from a year ago at 6.0 mln ha as of today. The acreage under pulses was 3.7 mln ha as of today, up 55% from 2.4 mln ha a year ago. Within pulses, acreage under tur surged 409% to 2.1 mln ha from 409,000 ha a year ago, the ministry data showed. The sharp increase in tur acreage is mainly due to the early onset of the monsoon in top tur-producing states such as Karnataka. During the last kharif season, the sowing of kharif crops was delayed due to the erratic monsoon. This also weighed on the production of tur and maize and further delayed the sowing of rabi crops. However, the forecast of an above-normal southwest monsoon this year by the India Meteorological Department bodes well for the agricultural sector this year as most kharif crops are heavily reliant on rainfall. Staggered withdrawal of the monsoon would benefit kharif crops and improve the soil moisture for the rabi season as well. The IMD has forecast that the southwest monsoon rainfall is likely to be above normal at over 106% of the long-period average. During the season so far, India has received a weighted average rainfall of 234.6 mm, 2% above the normal of 230.4 mm for the period, according to the data from the IMD. The government last month raised the minimum support prices of key kharif crops to encourage farmers to sow more pulses and oilseeds. The government increased the minimum support prices of 14 key kharif crops by 1.4-12.7% for the marketing season 2024-25 (Oct-Sep). The minimum support price of tur has been increased by nearly 8% to 7,550 rupees per 100 kg for the upcoming season, and that of urad by 6.5% to 7,400 rupees per 100 kg.

Gold edges higher as investors await Powell's testimony,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gold-edges-higher-as-investors-await-powells-testimony-12764934.html,Commodities,"Gold prices inched higher on Tuesday after a sharp drop in the previous session, with investors awaiting Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's testimony before Congress and June inflation data to assess the next policy move by the U.S. central bank. Spot gold was up 0.1% at $2,361.77 per ounce, as of 0208 GMT, after falling more than 1% on Monday. U.S. gold futures firmed 0.3% to $2,369.70. Powell will deliver two days of testimony before Congress, beginning later in the day with the Senate and followed by the House on Wednesday. ""After recent weak data, the market has high hopes for two rate cuts before the year ends. If Powell directly or indirectly implies that weakness is seeping through the U.S. economy, then it will be positive for gold,"" said Kelvin Wong, a senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at OANDA. A jobs report on Friday showed that the U.S. labour market was losing steam as the unemployment rate climbed to 4.1%. Markets are pricing in a 77% chance of a rate cut in September and a second one by December, according to CME's Fedwatch Tool. Non-yielding bullion's appeal tends to shine in a lower interest rate environment. Meanwhile, a Federal Reserve Bank of New York report said the path U.S. inflation is expected to follow over coming years generally softened in June, amid retreating projections of price increases for a wide array of consumer goods and services. Market participants were also awaiting June consumer (CPI) and producer (PPI) price indexes data scheduled to be released on Thursday and Friday, respectively. Softer inflation readings could see gold prices test the minor congestion resistance level of $2,410 in the short term, Wong said.

Brent futures fell 4 cents to $85.71 a barrel by 0113 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 5 cents to $82.28. Although oil refining activity slowed and some production sites were evacuated, major refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast appeared to see minimal impacts from Hurricane Beryl, which weakened into a tropical storm after hitting the Texas coast. That eased market worries about the risk of supply disruptions in Texas, where 40% of U.S. crude oil is produced. Major oil-shipping ports around Corpus Christi, Galveston and Houston had been shut ahead of the storm. The Corpus Christi Ship Channel reopened on Monday and the Port of Houston was projected to resume operations on Tuesday afternoon. Market participants are also keeping an eye on the situation in the Middle East for more trading cues. Oil prices settled down 1% on Monday amid hopes a possible ceasefire deal in Gaza could reduce worries about global crude supply disruptions. Senior U.S. officials were in Egypt for talks on Monday, but gaps remained between the two sides, the White House said, and Hamas said a new Israeli push into Gaza threatened the potential agreement. Hamas last week had dropped a demand for Israel to commit to a permanent ceasefire, which Israelis said opened the way for a deal.

Though the food price index registered a third consecutive monthly uptick, it was 2.1% lower than a year ago and 24.8% below the peak of 160.3 points reached in March 2022, FAO said in a report. The cereal price index averaged 115.2 points in June, down 3% on month and 9% from its June 2023 value, owing to a decline in wheat prices caused by the seasonal pressure from the ongoing harvest in the Northern Hemisphere. Slightly improved production prospects in some exporting countries, including Kazakhstan and Ukraine, along with the implementation of a temporary import ban by Turkey, contributed to the softer price tone, according to the report. The vegetable oil price index rose 3.1% on month to 131.8 points in June, marking the highest level since Mar 2023. The increase was driven by higher quotations across palm, soy, and sunflower oils, while rapeseed oil prices remained virtually unchanged. After declining for two consecutive months, international palm oil prices rebounded in June, mainly underpinned by a reviving global import demand due to increased price competitiveness. Meanwhile, global soy and sunflower oil prices continued to rise driven by firm demand from the biofuel sector in the Americas and declining export availability in the Black Sea region, according to the report. With regard to rapeseed oil, international prices remained stable in June, but were higher on year due to the tightening global supply outlook in the 2024-25 season. The sugar price index rose 1.9% on month to 119.4 points in June, after three consecutive monthly decreases. But prices are still down 21.6% from June last year. The increase in June was driven by a lower-than-expected harvest in Brazil in May, which heightened concerns about the impact of prolonged dry weather conditions on sugar production in the coming months, the report said. Erratic monsoon rainfall in India, coupled with a downward revision in crop yield forecasts in the European Union, also contributed to the overall upward pressure on world sugar prices, but it was partly offset by the weakening of the Brazilian real against the US dollar, according to FAO.

Gold lingers near one-month high on Fed rate-cut bets,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gold-lingers-near-one-month-high-on-fed-rate-cut-bets-12764149.html,Commodities,"Gold prices eased on Monday but hovered near a more than one-month high scaled in the previous session, after softer U.S. data boosted expectations of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September. Spot gold was down 0.2% at $2,385.88 per ounce, as of 0235 GMT, after rising to its highest level since May 22 on Friday. U.S. gold futures eased 0.1% to $2,394.50. Data on Friday showed that the unemployment rate hit a 2-1/2-year high of 4.1%, pointing to a slackening labour market. Market focus this week is on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's semi-annual Congressional testimony, comments from a series of Fed officials and U.S. inflation data. Friday's weak jobs report helped gold prices enjoy best week in three months, a soft U.S. inflation report and a dovish tone from Powell when he testifies looks like the ideal catalyst for gold to consider new highs, said Matt Simpson, a senior analyst at City Index. Markets are expecting a 78% chance of a September rate by the Fed, according to CME's Fedwatch Tool. Traders are also pricing in a rising chance of a second rate cut in December. Lower rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion. However, bullion prices were capped by news that top consumer China's central bank refrained from gold purchases to its reserves for a second consecutive month in June. ""China may have paused their gold purchases, but it remains in demand overall. And that is likely to keep gold on bullish watchlists and tempt bullish bets upon any dips,"" Simpson said. Spot silver fell 0.2% to $31.14 after hitting a one-month peak in the last session. PLatinum edged 0.5% lower to $1,021.45 and palladium slipped 1.7% to $1,008.51.

Brent crude futures inched up 11 cents, or 0.1%, to $86.65 a barrel as at 0042 GMT after closing down 89 cents on Friday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was at $83.08 a barrel, down 8 cents, after settling down 72 cents in the previous session. The ports of Corpus Christi, Houston, Galveston, Freeport and Texas City closed on Sunday to prepare for Tropical Storm Beryl which could grow into a Category 2 hurricane after making landfall in the middle of the Texas coast between Galveston and Corpus Christi later on Monday. Port closures could bring a temporary halt to crude and liquefied natural gas exports, oil shipments to refineries, and motor fuel deliveries from those plants. ""It looks like a storm surge, power outages are likely,"" said IG analyst Tony Sycamore based in Sydney. He added that there is also a good chance of U.S. data showing another large weekly draw in U.S. oil inventories amid peak driving season which will be supportive for oil prices. WTI gained 2.1% last week after data from the Energy Information Administration showed stockpiles for crude and refined products fell in the week ending June 28. [EIA/S] The number of operating oil rigs in the U.S. were unchanged at 479 last week, holding at its lowest since December 2021, Baker Hughes said in its weekly report on Friday. Oil prices were also supported by hopes of interest rate cuts, Sycamore said, following U.S. data on Friday that showed inflation is easing and job growth slowing. Lower interest rates can boost economic activity and increase crude oil demand. Investors were also watching for any impact from elections in the UK, France and Iran last week on geopolitics and energy policies. France faced potential political deadlock after elections on Sunday threw up a hung parliament while Iranians chose Masoud Pezeshkian as their new president, a relative moderate who beat a hard-line rival in the election.

Commodity markets await more supportive data next week to solidify expectations for Fed rate cut in September,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/commodities/commodity-markets-await-more-supportive-data-next-week-to-solidify-expectations-for-fed-rate-cut-in-september-12764036.html,Commodities,"Kaynat Chainwala, AVP Commodity Research at Kotak Securities Markets closed the week ended July 5 on an optimistic note as visible signs of a slowdown in the US economy bolstered prospects for Federal Reserve rate cuts. Dollar was supported well above 105 levels in the earlier part of the week supported by a somewhat dovish commentary by Fed Chair Jerome Powell and simmering tensions in the Middle East. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged progress in inflation in getting back on a downward path but reiterated that officials need more evidence before lowering interest rates. This, coupled with unexpected increase in US JOLTs Job Openings in May pushed greenback to a two-month high of 106 levels. However, dollar pulled back from higher levels and closed at a seven-week low of 104.88 after the official jobs report indicated a steady slowdown in the labour market. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed the US economy added 2,06,000 non-farm payroll jobs in June, more than the Bloomberg estimate of 1,90,000, but it is to be noted that job growth in the prior two months was revised down by 1,11,000. At the same time, the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1 percent, highest since November 2021 and wage inflation continued to cool as Average hourly earnings rose 3.9 percent in June from a year ago, smallest annual advance in three years. Overall, the report did confirm a moderation in US labour markets and raised the odds of a September Fed rate cut, lifting S&P 500 and Dow Jones to record highs and pushing COMEX Gold above $2,400 per troy ounce for the first time since early June. According to CME’s FedWatch Tool, Futures markets are now pricing in 72 percent chance for a 25 bps rate cut at the Fed’s meeting in September, up from a 57.9 percent chance seen a week ago. Silver rallied as much as 6.5 percent this week, in line with sharp gains in both gold and base metals. MCX Gold (Aug), on the four hourly chart has given an upward breakout of its ‘Cup & Handle’ chart pattern confirming an upward bias. In addition, RSI (14) is hovering around 74.80 levels indicating dominance of the bulls. Next resistance for the counter is placed at Rs 73,550 per 10 grams above which major resistance is placed at Rs 74,000. LME base metals closed the week higher, with copper leading the pack with nearly 4 percent gains, as Fed rate cut optimism far outweighed concerns of a patchy recovery in China. WTI Crude oil hit $84.52 per barrel, highest since late April, buoyed further by concerns of a more severe storm season, largest inventory drawdown in over a year and escalating geopolitical tensions. Oil is set for more gains as the Lebanese Hezbollah group launched over 200 rockets on Thursday at several military bases in Israel in retaliation for an attack that killed one of its senior commanders. Following the release of official jobs data, markets are now awaiting more supportive data to solidify expectations for a September rate cut, starting with US inflation figures next week. US CPI is expected to rise by 0.1 percent after remaining unchanged in May, while Core CPI is expected to hold steady at 0.2 percent. A larger-than-expected increase could prompt investors to reconsider the likelihood of a Fed rate cut, while a negative surprise could bolster market confidence even further. Fed Chair Powell's testimony will be closely watched, although it's unlikely he will provide hints on the monetary policy outlook. Besides, Chinese CPI is expected to improve to 0.4 percent in June, following stagnant price growth at 0.3 percent in April and May, while PPI deflation is projected to narrow further to 0.8 percent. If both indicators meet these estimates, it would indicate an improvement in domestic demand.
