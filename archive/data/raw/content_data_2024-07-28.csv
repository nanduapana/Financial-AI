It's battleground South India as UltraTech announces acquisition of India Cements,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/mergers-acquisitions/its-battleground-south-india-as-ultratech-announces-acquisition-of-india-cements-12780382.html,general,NA,"Through its acquisition of India Cements, India's largest cement maker, UltraTech Cement Ltd, is looking to expand in Southern India which has been a difficult market to penetrate for large cement makers due to the presence of established regional listed and unlisted players with entrenched dealership networks and brand recognition. UltraTech announced on Sunday that its board has approved plans to acquire a majority stake in India Cements Ltd from promoter N. Srinivasan and his family, a month after the Aditya Birla group-owned entity acquired a near-23 percent stake in the latter. The move, subject to regulatory clearances, including from the Competition Commission of India, may prove to be a landmark in the fight for market leadership in Southern India, with UltraTech's main rival, Adani Cement, threatening to gain an advantage in the region through acquisitions and expansions. India Cements' 14.45 MTPA cement capacity is largely located in southern states, particularly in Tamil Nadu. As of June, UltraTech had an operational capacity of 149.5 MTPA in India and 154.9 MTPA overall.  In a recent investor presentation, Ultratech said that it has plans to reach a capacity of 183.5 MTPA by FY27. A little over a week ago, during UltraTech Cement's April-June earnings call, the company's chief financial officer, Atul Daga, told investors that the initial 23 percent stake it bought in India Cements was just a ""smart financial investment.""  UltraTech said on July 28 that the majority stake acquisition in India will help augment the company's only other integrated unit in Tamil Nadu, located in Reddipalayam, which has a capacity of 1.4 MTPA but faces a scarcity of limestone, potentially limiting its lifecycle. UltraTech, with a capacity in the south of around 25 MTPA, operates several integrated cement plants and grinding units across Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Telangana. UltraTech commissioned 4.5 MTPA of cement capacity in southern India during the April-June quarter, in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. In June, Adani Cement acquired the unlisted cement maker Penna Cement for more than Rs 10,000 crore and is reportedly looking for more acquisitions in the sector. UltraTech too has eyed other acquisitions, with the company in the process of merging Kesoram Industries' cement operations with itself, which will add 10.75 MTPA in capacity, particularly in Southern India. Reports have said that UltraTech has been in talks with Orient Cement, another regional player in southern India, and owned by UltraTech chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla's uncle CK Birla. Entities such as Dalmia Bharat and Shree Cement, both of which have a significant presence in southern markets, have also outlined plans to expand and maintain their presence in the region. They are also betting on other markets, particularly the east and the north, in anticipation of the impending fight for market share in the south. The yet-unlisted JSW Cement operates a grinding unit in Karnataka and has ready-mix concrete units elsewhere in the southern states. Despite concerns about relatively sluggish cement pricing in southern markets, the promise of large-scale infrastructure development projects in the region, such as Andhra Pradesh's capital Amaravati, as well as real estate development in a region better-off economically than others, have attracted large cement players to the region. According to an exchange filing by UltraTech, the company is buying a 32.72 percent stake in India Cements from their promoters, including N. Srinivasan and other entities representing the promoter group, for Rs 3,954 crore, at Rs 390 per share. UltraTech is also planning an open offer to other shareholders to acquire a further 26 percent stake in the company. India Cements, led by 79-year-old Srinivasan, has been looking to pare down some of its relatively high debt and has been looking to monetize some of its assets. Earlier this year, the company sold a cement grinding unit in Parli, Maharashtra, to UltraTech for Rs 315 crore. Media reports have indicated that the next generation of the Srinivasan family, including his daughter Rupa Gurunath, does not wish to run the company after Srinivasan steps down from the board, which is imminent due to his age and health. For FY24, India Cements reported a consolidated revenue of Rs 5,112.24 crore, lower than the Rs 5,608 crore the previous year, and a net loss of Rs 227.34 crore for the year ended March 31, 2024, higher than the loss of Rs 126.89 crore the previous year. India Cements has also been struggling with inefficiencies in managing expenses such as power, fuel, and other elements, and had proposed a Rs 700 crore spend over two years on capital expenditure, largely dedicated to improving efficiency.

Focus on these 6 sectors post budget; pharma and IT could be dark horses,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/expert-columns/focus-on-these-6-sectors-post-budget-pharma-and-it-could-be-dark-horses-12780169.html,general,NA,"By Mohit Khanna, Fund Manager at Purnartha One Strategy In general, the market's expectation was that the government will use the RBI’s dividend payout for welfare activities. However, the Government chose to use almost the entire payout to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.9 percent or by 70bps YoY. This is commendable, especially when this was the first Budget under a coalition government. The FM re-distributed the expenditure basket while maintaining the capital expenditure at Rs 11.11 lakh crore (as announced in the interim budget) and increasing the allocation to the rural sector. Further, the FM introduced a new policy for education and skilling – Employment Linked Incentives (ELI). So, we can see that the Government’s focus has shifted from PLI (production linked incentive) to ELI. Let me share 2 data points that was highlighted in the Economic Survey –1) India needs to create ~80 lakh jobs per year till 2036 at least2) Factories with 100+ workers have seen 13 percent workforce growth – implying that India's manufacturing is getting more organized. By introducing ELI, the government is looking to accelerate job creation in the formal sector. This should have a gradual but a strong positive impact on the economy over the next few years. Another aspect is that the Government’s spending was lower in the first quarter of the fiscal due to the general elections – plus we have another Budget in February 2025 i.e. only 6 months from now. This means that the yearly expenditure should now be done in less time. There can be two possible outcomes –1) Government meets its expenditure targets – proving a strong tailwind to multiple sectors2) Government spends less – beating fiscal deficit target – leading to lower inflation and possible lower interest rates by RBI under its Monetary Policy. Sectors in Focus Infra/Capital Goods & Railways Allocation for new infra projects in Bihar, Andhra Pradesh (for Amravati) should help the EPC players focused in those regions. New power plant announcement is also positive. On the Railway side, the allocation of Rs 2.7 lakh crore remained flat as compared to FY24 RE. However, as the government has increased the procurement quantity target (Wagons by 46 percent, Electrical locomotives by 25 percent), my sense is that actual expenditure could increase in the sector. Additionally, a dedicated freight corridor would also lead to higher demand for rolling stock. This could be incrementally positive for players manufacturing the capital goods for the sector. Allocation to highways remains the same as in the interim budget while allocation to other roads has been increased 6 percent (as compared to FY24 RE). Agriculture No major change as compared to the interim budget/ongoing trend. Fertilizer subsidy for both NBS and Urea remains unchanged from the interim budget. Release of 109 high-yielding crops should have a positive impact on farm income – but the impact should only be gradual and difficult to measure at this point in time. Reduction in BCD (basic customs duty) for aquaculture inputs is positive and will help the sector re-gain a bit of the lost ground in the export markets. Real Estate & Building Material The government has removed indexation benefits for LTCG (Long Term Capital Gains) calculation. I do not see any major impact from the end-user perspective in the middle-income group category. However, there could be some slow-down in the investment property segment as the holding period of such assets should decrease overtime. On the contrary, the regulatory landscape for REITs and InvITs has significantly improved, creating a more level playing field for investors. By reducing the long-term holding period from three to one year, these asset classes have become more attractive. This positive change is expected to stimulate increased allocation of REITs and InvITs within investor portfolios, diversifying their holdings and potentially enhancing returns. Affordable Urban housing saw ~36 percent increase in allocation (as compared to FY24 revised estimates) with PMAY (U) securing an allocation of Rs 30,170 crore. This should not only help developers focusing on the segment but also the building material companies like Cement, Tiles, Pipes, etc. Business Services Staffing, Skilling and recruitment services companies could see a start of strong tailwinds with ELI (Employment Linked Incentives). However, due to the lack of much empirical evidence, it is difficult to estimate the actual impact of such a policy. Nevertheless, the Government's expenditure announcement totaling Rs 2 lakh crore over the next 5 years is too good to be ignored. Capital Markets Increase in CG (capital gains) tax rates and STT (Securities Transaction Tax) is marginally negative for the trading volumes but it was a much-needed bitter-pill to discourage high-frequency speculative trades in the F&O segment by unskilled retail investors. Interestingly, SEBI’s recent proposal to allow a new asset class with F&O products will help the sector over the medium-term. Consumer The finance minister has laid a lot of emphasis on job creation and has also increased allocation towards rural. While this is positive for consumption related sectors, the new investment in these sectors should only be gradual as it is already expensive. Import duty cut on precious metals should ultimately help retailers. Inventory losses due to lower pricing should be well mitigated by higher volume sales (demand). Annual tax saving of Rs 17,500 per year should be marginally positive for consumption in general. Additionally, Pharma & IT could be the dark horses but not really related to budget announcement but other external factors like the recent Rupee depreciation following China's rate cut.

Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,980, Rs 2,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,770, Rs 1,660 Snowman Logistics | CMP: Rs 85.33  Since November 2023, Snowman Logistics has been consolidating within a broad range (Rs 83-55), representing strong accumulation. However, with Friday's gain, the stock has confirmed a ""consolidation zone"" breakout at Rs 83 levels on a closing basis. This breakout is accompanied by huge volumes, indicating increased participation. Recently, the stock has recaptured its 20, 50, and 100-day SMAs, which reconfirms a bullish trend.

Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 99-113 Stop-Loss: Rs 80, Rs 75 Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst at Angel One Apollo Hospitals Enterprise | CMP: Rs 6,664.55  Apollo Hospitals has been in a consolidation phase for the past few months, but a bullish 'Saucer' pattern on the daily chart suggests the potential resumption of the primary uptrend. This breakout is confirmed by a strong bullish candle. Prices have been finding solid support at the 20-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average), with recent dips being bought into. Additionally, a fresh positive crossover is occurring as the 50-day EMA crosses above the 89-day EMA. Given this setup, we have a positive outlook on the stock. Hence, we recommend buying the stock around Rs 6,666 - Rs 6,660. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 7,175 Stop-Loss: Rs 6,388 Eicher Motors | CMP: Rs 5,012.5  For the past few weeks, Nifty Auto Index has been trading within a tight range of 26,000 - 24,800. On Friday, we saw a bullish breakout, leading to a broad-based rally in this sector. Eicher Motors also experienced a significant breakout, closing above Rs 4,980 levels, which had previously acted as strong resistance. This breakout confirms a bullish continuation with an ‘Ascending Triangle’ pattern. Prices have now entered uncharted territory, indicating strong momentum driven by the bulls. Hence, we recommend buying Eicher Motors around Rs 5,010 - Rs 5,000. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 5,290 Stop-Loss: Rs 4,860 Quess Corp | CMP: Rs 711.15  During the last week, Quess Corp experienced strong positive momentum, confirming a bullish reversal pattern known as the ‘Inverse Head and Shoulders’ on the weekly chart. This breakout is backed by a significant surge in volume and a large bullish candle. Prices are positioned above key moving averages, and oscillators are positively aligned, reinforcing the buy signal. Hence, we recommend buying Quess Corp around Rs 711 - Rs 705. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 790 Stop-Loss: Rs 669 Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical and Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities One 97 Communications (Paytm) | CMP: Rs 509  Paytm has been consistently making higher tops and higher bottoms over the last few weeks. Last week (ended July 26), the stock bounced from the 20-day SMA and cleared its nearby resistances on the back of above-average volumes. With momentum readings like the 14-day RSI also in rising mode, this suggests that the uptrend will continue. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 570 Stop-Loss: Rs 455 Piramal Enterprises | CMP: Rs 992  Piramal Enterprises has been consistently moving higher over the last few weeks. Last week, the stock broke out of its recent range on the back of above-average volumes. Technical indicators are giving positive signals, as there was a recent positive moving average crossover with the 20-day SMA moving above the 50-day SMA. With the 14-week RSI also in rising mode and above its 9-week EMA, we expect the stock to head higher in the coming sessions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 925 Campus Activewear | CMP: Rs 311  Campus Activewear reversed its intermediate downtrend in April 2024 and has since been making higher tops and higher bottoms. Last week, it broke out of a trading range on the back of healthy volumes. Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI are also in rising mode and not overbought. With the intermediate technical setup looking encouraging, we expect the stock to gradually move higher in the coming sessions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 360 Stop-Loss: Rs 282 Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi IDFC First Bank | CMP: Rs 74.5  After reaching a peak near Rs 101 in September 2023, IDFC First Bank experienced a substantial correction of Rs 30, translating to a 29.34 percent decline from its high. Recently, the stock found support near the 0.618 retracement level of its previous upmove from 53 to 101. Additionally, a bullish BAT pattern has formed precisely at this 0.618 retracement level, making the current levels attractive for buying. Based on these technical indicators, buying in the Rs 72-75 zone is recommended. The target price is set at Rs 84, with a stop-loss placed near Rs 68.5 on a daily close basis.

In an interaction with Moneycontrol, Revankar said that the company, after receiving the approval, is working internally on the operations side. “We have got the in-principle approval recently and now we will look at working internally for the next two quarters on the business side,” Revankar said. We still have nothing to decide on who will head the ARC, but the group, i.e. Shriram Group and not Shriram Finance exclusively, will look at the options, he said. The company had submitted the application to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in November 2023. The ARC will be a 100 percent subsidiary of Shriram Capital, Revankar said. Earlier in November 2023, in a post results call, Revankar had said that the ARC will focus more on retail loans, except microfinance loans, in terms of acquisition. This is because, there is no one in the retail segment who has the reach, network and capability of collections, and the company is trying to specialise in the area, he had further said. Speaking about the management of the ARC front, Revankar had said that the company is trying to build an in-house team. ""Reasonably, we have a large team size to identify from today and I can put them there and make it successful,"" Revankar had said in November 2023. Q1 numbers Shriram Finance, the flagship company of diversified conglomerate Shriram Group, on Friday reported a 19 percent increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 2,031 crore for the June quarter of FY25. The financial services firm registered a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,712 crore during the corresponding quarter of last year. Total income during the quarter under review grew to Rs 9,610 crore from Rs 8,293 crore a year ago, 16 percent YoY growth, Shriram Finance said in a regulatory filing. Total expenses rose to Rs 6,943 crore from Rs 5,760 crore in the same quarter a year ago, a growth of 21 percent. The company's asset quality improved with Gross Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) declining to 5.39 percent of gross advances as of June 30, 2024, from 6.03 percent by the end of first quarter of the previous fiscal. Net NPAs also moderated to 2.71 percent of the advances, from 2.96 percent at the end of the first quarter last year.

Not all residents leaving India require tax clearance certificates: FinMin,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/not-all-residents-leaving-india-require-tax-clearance-certificates-finmin-12780347.html,general,NA,"The mandate to obtain tax clearances for residents leaving India is not for everyone, the finance ministry clarified on July 28. ""As per section 230 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, every person is not required to obtain a tax clearance certificate. Only in the case of certain persons, in respect of whom circumstances exist which make it necessary to obtain a tax clearance certificate will be required to obtain such certificate,"" the ministry said. The Budget for 2024-25 introduced a few amendments for those planning to move abroad from India. The ministry added that only in certain cases would an individual need to obtain such a tax clearance: -Where the person is involved in serious financial irregularities and his presence is necessary in investigation of cases under the Income-tax Act or the Wealth-tax Act and it is likely that a tax demand will be raised against him. -Where the person has direct tax arrears exceeding Rs 10 lakh which have not been stayed by any authority. ""Further, a person can be asked to obtain a tax clearance certificate only after recording the reasons for the same and after taking approval from the Principal Chief Commissioner of Income-tax or Chief Commissioner of Income-tax,"" the ministry said in a statement. The Budget introduced a change to ensure that no one having tax liabilities under the Black Money rules will leave the country without a clearance from the authorities. However, the rules under Section 230 apply differently to residents and non-residents. On the tweak in the Budget pertaining to the requirement of a no-liabilities clearance certificate with respect to black money, the ministry said, ""it has been proposed to add the reference of Black Money Act, 2015 in the list of Acts under which any person should clear his liabilities in order to obtain the tax clearance certificate.""

Chennai Super Kings ownership to be unaffected by India Cements sale,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/chennai-super-kings-ownership-to-be-unaffected-by-india-cements-sale-12780357.html,general,NA,"There will be no change, at least for now, in the ownership of the Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket team Chennai Super Kings (CSK), controlled by India Cements promoters N. Srinivasan and his family, once they sell their stake in the cement maker to Aditya Birla Group’s UltraTech Cement as announced on Sunday. The transaction will have no impact on the controlling shareholding of CSK, in which Srinivasan and his family now own 28.14 percent, according to people familiar with the matter. In an exchange filing, UltraTech Cement said that its board has approved the purchase of a 32.72 percent stake in India Cements from its promoters and their associates, adding to its initial acquisition of a 22.77 percent stake in June at Rs 268 per share. The latest transaction, totalling Rs 3,954 crore at Rs 390 per share, will increase UltraTech’s ownership in India Cements to 55.49 percent, necessitating a mandatory open offer at the same per-share price. CSK’s latest annual report lists seven names as promoters: EWS Finance and Investments (21.47 percent), Rupa Gurunath as trustee of the Financial Services Trust and Securities Services Trust (6.48 percent), N. Srinivasan (0.14 percent), Chitra Srinivasan (0.02 percent), Rupa Gurunath (0.01 percent), S. K. Ashok Baalaje (0.02 percent), and Rajam Krishnamurthy (1,940 shares), Moneycontrol reported on September 9 last year. The reorganization happened after the India Cements Shareholders Trust distributed almost its entire holding of CSK shares to eligible promoter and non-promoter shareholders of India Cements. The stake held by the India Cements Shareholders Trust fell to 1.76 percent in FY23 from over 30 percent in the previous year. The trust distributed 384,882 CSK shares to non-promoter shareholders of India Cements and 86.7 million shares to promoters of India Cements, according to company’s 2023 annual report. CSK was created as a division of India Cements in 2008. But in 2015, the cement company hived off CSK as an independent company by selling its entire holding in CS to a trust called India Cements Shareholder Trust, which was to be controlled by three independent directors of India Cements. Subsequently, in FY23, the trust distributed the CSK shares to promoter and non-promoter shareholders of India Cements. Super Kings is one of the most successful IPL franchises, having won five IPL titles (same as Mumbai Indians). In the IPL, they have appeared in a record 10 finals and qualified for the playoff stages 12 times out of the 15 seasons they have played, more than any other team. Super Kings have also won the Champions League Twenty20 twice, in 2010 and 2014.

The auction was annulled as the ""required number of bids as per the mineral auction rules have not been received"", the notice said. The three critical mineral blocks were scrapped under the third tranche of sale of mines due to a lower-than-required number of bidders as reported by PTI.The three blocks are Salal-Haimna Lithium, Titanium and Bauxite (Aluminous Laterite) Block in Jammu and Kashmir, Muskaniya-Gareriatola-Barwari Potash block in Jharkhand and Kurunjakulam Graphite block in Tamil Nadu.The Mines Ministry, on March 14, put on sale seven critical mineral blocks in the third round of auction.

Jammu terrorist attacks: Experts explain how terror tactics have changed and what's complicating military ops,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/jammu-terrorist-attacks-shoot-and-scoot-is-new-terror-tactic-experts-explain-whats-complicating-military-ops-12780366.html,general,NA,"With the recent increase in terrorist activities in the otherwise peaceful Jammu region, security experts recommend a thorough reassessment of the current counter-terrorism strategies used by security forces. The Jammu region has experienced a series of violent incidents in recent weeks. A recent ambush in the remote forest areas of Kathua resulted in the deaths of nine army personnel, including a captain. The perpetrators, who have adopted ""shoot and scoot"" tactic, remain at large. According to news agency PTI, Lieutenant General (retd) D S Hooda, former General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Udhampur-based Northern Command, emphasised the urgent need for a proactive approach to counter the evolving terrorist tactics. Another top officer, former Deputy Chief of Army Staff (Strategy) Lt Gen Paramjit Singh Sangha expressed confidence the security forces will learn from their recent mistakes and improve counter-insurgency efforts. On June 9, a terrorist attack claimed the lives of nine passengers, including seven pilgrims returning from the Shiv Khori temple in Reasi district. While the police have arrested several suspects connected to the attack, the main assailants remain unidentified. ""Over time, we have observed a shift in tactics, with terrorists increasingly adopting ambush and 'shoot and scoot' strategies,"" Lt Gen (retd) Hooda was cited by PTI. Distinguishing between the operational environments of Jammu and the Valley, Hooda said that while terrorists in Kashmir are often contained within localised areas, those in Jammu are strategically positioned in challenging terrains, complicating military responses. ""In some areas, troops may have to trek for eight to 10 hours to reach a specific location,"" PTI quoted Hooda as saying. He also said a prolonged period of relative peace in the Jammu region may have contributed to lapses in vigilance, and cautioned against complacency within the security establishment. According to PTI, former Deputy Chief of Army Staff (Strategy) Lt Gen (Retd) Paramjit Singh Sangha also echoed similar sentiments and expressed confidence in the security forces' capacity to learn from the recent setbacks and improve counter-insurgency efforts. ""We need to learn honest and correct lessons and ensure that mistakes are not repeated,"" he was quoted PTI. ""Unlike conventional warfare, there are no deadlines."" ""The Northern Command is undoubtedly taking these incidents seriously and implementing corrective measures,"" he said. Following a decisive campaign against terrorism in 2005 that significantly reduced militant activities in Jammu, the region has experienced a resurgence of violence. This uptick is particularly noticeable in the twin border districts of Rajouri and Poonch, where over 70 people, including 52 security personnel, have been killed in terror-related incidents since 2021. Hooda also advocated for the revival of Village Defence Committees and the recruitment of more Special Police Officers from local communities to enhance counter-terrorism efforts. ""The locals have traditionally been the eyes and ears of the Army in this region,"" he noted.. Discussing long term solutions, Gen (Retd) Hooda recalled discussions during his tenure about implementing smart fencing along the borders. He criticised the current fencing system, which deteriorates during the rainy season, compromising security. ""Instead of waiting for a perfect solution, we need to put up a fence that offers better protection than what we currently have,"" he said. Concerns have also been raised about the detection of tunnels used by terrorists to infiltrate Indian territory, prompting experts to call for prioritizing solutions to this growing challenge.

"As July 31 ITR filing deadline approaches, a look at how to choose the correct income tax return form",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/as-july-31-itr-filing-deadline-approaches-a-look-at-how-to-choose-the-correct-income-tax-return-form-12780404.html,general,NA,"The due date for filing income tax returns for the financial year 2023-24 - July 31 - is now three days away. Over 5 crore tax-payers have already filed their returns, as per the income tax (I-T) department. If you are not one of them, you need to hurry, lest you face consequences such as delay in refunds, late-filing fees, interest on taxes due, if any, and so on. One of the initial tasks in the process is selecting the correct ITR form applicable. Here's a quick guide on relevant forms for individual tax-payers: ITR-1 and ITR-2: For salaried taxpayers Salaried individuals can choose between ITR-1 and ITR-2, depending on their residential status, income level and sources of income. ITR-1 (Sahaj) is a simple form that residents, salaried taxpayers or pensioners with income of less than Rs 50 lakh can use. Then, there are some other conditions, such as it is relevant to taxpayers with only one house, agricultural income of up to Rs 5,000, and income from savings or fixed deposits, dividends, and family pension. The form is pre-filled with personal information, income details, and financial transaction data to enable quick and easy filing. Individuals can verify the ITR data with their Form 16 and bank account statements, besides checking Form 26AS and the Annual Information Statement (AIS), and complete the process online. Also read: How to choose between ITR-1 and ITR-2 ITR-2: For complex financial dealings If you are a salaried individual or pensioner – someone without any income from a business or profession – with income of over Rs 50 lakh, multiple sources of income, financial transactions, and so on, you cannot use ITR-1. Put simply, you should file ITR-2 if you are not eligible to file returns using ITR-1. For example, if you are non-resident or resident but not ordinarily resident (RNOR) salaried individual or pensioner, you will have to use ITR-2. This form is also the relevant form if you have made capital gains or losses during financial year (2023-24). Likewise, if you are a director in a company, own unlisted shares or ESOPs, maintain a foreign bank account or any other assets outside India, you will have to use ITR-2 and not ITR-1. However, you cannot use ITR-2 if you have profits to show from a business or profession. Also read: Your one-stop guide to filing income tax returns ITR-3: For businesspersons Individuals with profits from business or profession (as also Hindu Undivided Families) will have to file their returns using this form. Your other sources of income could include salary or pension, capital gains, house property and so on. Put simply, as per the I-T rules, individuals who are not eligible to file returns under ITR-1, ITR-2 and ITR-4 can use this form. Also read: Your one-stop guide to filing income tax returns for FY 2023-24 ITR-4 (Sugam): For small businesspersons, professionals Resident individual taxpayers, Hindu Undivided Families (HUF) or firms (but not LLPs) with incomes of up to Rs 50 lakh from business or a profession can use this form. Filing returns using Sugam is not mandatory—it is an option given primarily to small-time businesspersons or professionals to ensure simpler returns and fewer documentation hassles. Using this form, you can declare earnings through a business or profession on a ‘presumptive’ basis under sections 44AD, 44ADA or 44AE. It is applicable only to individuals with income of up to Rs 50 lakh from a business or profession, computed on a presumptive basis (under section 44AD/44ADA/44AE). Effective financial year 2023-24, section 44AD and section 44ADA turnover and gross receipts thresholds have been raised to Rs 3 crore (up from Rs 2 crore) and Rs 75 lakh (up from 50 lakh), respectively. That is, provided the amount or aggregate of the amounts received during the previous year, in cash, does not exceed 5 percent of the total gross receipts. The other conditions are similar to those of ITR-1: salary or pension income with one house property, income from family pension, dividend or interest from deposits, and agricultural income of up to Rs 5,000. As with ITR-1, the ITR-4 form cannot be used by an individual who is a director in a company, has held unlisted equity shares, has any foreign income or assets, including dormant bank accounts, has brought forward any loss, has incurred losses that have to be carried forward, and so on.

Two Olympics later, 22-year-old Bhaker brought glory to India by winning a bronze after scoring 221.7. Korea's Kim Yeji claimed the silver with a total of 241.3 while her compatriot Jin Ye Oh took home the gold with a Games record of 243.2. ""After Tokyo I was very disappointed and it took me a very long time to overcome that. Frankly speaking, I really can't explain how good I am feeling today,"" Bhaker, whose Tokyo campaign had ended in tears after her pistol malfunctioned during the qualification of the same event, said with a wide smile on her face. ""I was fighting with all the energy I have. Really grateful that I could win the bronze. I read Bhagwat Gita and always tried to do what I am supposed to do, left everything else to god ""We can't fight destiny,"" added the world champion in 25m pistol event.

Basement meant for storage used as library: How Delhi coaching centre flouted fire safety norms,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/basement-meant-for-storage-used-as-library-how-delhi-coaching-centre-flouted-fire-safety-norms-12780328.html,general,NA,"The Delhi coaching centre had permission to use the basement, where three civil services aspirants died after flooding owing to heavy rain on Saturday, only for storage purposes and not as a library, according to the Delhi Fire Services’ (DFS) No-Objection Certificate (NOC) accessed by CNN-News18. Shreya Yadav of Ambedkar Nagar in Uttar Pradesh, Tanya Soni from Telangana and Navin Dalwin from Ernakulam in Kerala died in the incident in central Delhi’s Old Rajinder Nagar area. The post-mortem will be carried out on Sunday. DFS sources told News18: “Violating the NOC, the owners of Rau’s IAS Coaching Academy were using the basement space as library.” The NOC clearly states: “Basement shall be used strictly as per building byelaws”. The DFS will write to the Delhi Police to add relevant sections to the First Information Report (FIR). THE LIBRARY BIOMETRIC SYSTEM LOCKED THE DOORS The building had four floors, a parking space and a basement. The rain for an hour on Saturday turned the area into a sinkhole and led to flooding as the silt was not cleared. The clearing of the silt and drain with suction pumps began on Sunday, amid the uproar over the mishap. According to students, the library had a biometric system installed, which meant that the doors would not open without the fingerprint being verified. As the water started to fill in, the power supply went off, leaving the doors locked. This could amount to “non-functional safety measures” mentioned in the NOC, thus hinting at another violation. “After every rainfall, water collects in this area. This has been happening for the past many years. The road on which the waterlogging happens acts like a sinkhole. We have our exams in the next few months…In minutes at least the water level in the basement went up to 12 feet…We have seen more bodies being taken by police. The rescue team took hours to reach here…,” said Shadman Zaffar, 26, from Patna, who has been preparing for IAS for the past two years. Students protested at the site on Sunday, demanding the CCTV footage, claiming that the number of casualties could be at least 20. ACTION TAKEN SO FARDelhi Police on Sunday arrested the owner and coordinator of Rau’s IAS Study Circle. The Delhi Police, in its FIR at at Rajinder Nagar Police Station, has booked the accused under: Section 105 (culpable homicide)Section 106(1) (death of any person by doing any rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide)Section 115(2) (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt)Section 290 (negligent conduct with respect to pulling down, repairing or constructing buildings)Section 3/5 (common intention) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) “We have registered an FIR at Rajinder Nagar Police Station…and launched an investigation,” Deputy Commissioner of Police M Harsha Vardhan said, adding they are looking at CCTV footage to understand the sequence of events. CALL WAS RECEIVED AT 7PM According to the DFS, a call about waterlogging was received from the coaching centre around 7 pm on Saturday, stating there was a possibility that some people were trapped. Police said it appeared that the basement got flooded quickly due to which some people were trapped inside. A fire department official said a total of five tenders were rushed to the site and the basement was full of water when they arrived. Ropes were used to evacuate the trapped students, officials said. The furniture at the coaching centre was floating and created obstruction in the rescue operation, a police officer said.

PSU banks may get another 2-year extension to comply with minimum public shareholding norms: Official,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/economy/policy/psu-banks-may-get-another-2-year-extension-to-comply-with-minimum-public-shareholding-norms-official-12780377.html,general,NA,"A top government official has said that the state-owned banks are expected to get another two-year extension to comply with Sebi’s minimum public shareholding (MPS) norms. Financial Services Secretary Vivek Joshi told PTI in an interview that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) gave special forbearance to PSU banks till August 2024 to meet the requirement of 25 per cent MPS.”We have written to the Department of Economic Affairs for the extension.” As per the Sebi, all listed companies must maintain an MPS of 25 per cent. Out of 12 public sector banks (PSBs), five are yet to comply with MPS norms and the government’s holding is beyond 75 per cent.Currently, government holding in Delhi-based Punjab & Sind Bank is 98.25 per cent. It is followed by Chennai-based Indian Overseas Bank at 96.38 per cent, UCO Bank 95.39 per cent, Central Bank of India 93.08 per cent, Bank of Maharashtra at 86.46 per cent.It is expected that the government holding in Bank of Maharashtra could come below 75 per cent during the current fiscal, he said.However, Joshi said, the banks’ will take decision on share sale through Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) or other route depending on their capital absorption needs.Generally, Vivek Joshi said, a two-year extension is given and hopefully it should come sooner than later. Depending on market conditions, each of these banks will take a call in the best interest of shareholders, he added. When asked about the Budget announcement of the financial sector vision and strategy document, Joshi said it will be anchored by the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) and released during the current fiscal.”The strategy we have for Vision 2047 will be covered in this document.

The Department has done some work while legislation is another big area being reviewed, he said, adding, the document would be completed during the current financial year. *With PTI Inputs

Indian athletics team faces hurdles in Paris Olympics preparation amid Russia-Ukraine conflict: Report,https://www.moneycontrol.com/sports/olympics/indian-athletics-team-faces-hurdles-in-paris-olympics-preparation-amid-russia-ukraine-conflict-report-article-12780221.html,general,NA,"The Indian athletics team's preparations for the ongoing Paris Olympics have been significantly disrupted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. According to a report by The Times of India, two Russian coaches and a masseur attached to the Indian athletics contingent are still awaiting the processing of their Olympic Identity and Accreditation Cards (OIACs) by the Paris Games organizing committee. Athletes and coaches typically receive a Pre-Valid Card (PVC), which, along with a valid passport, serves as an entry document to France. Upon arrival in Paris, this PVC is validated into an OIAC card, granting them access to competition venues and other essential services during the Games. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has issued a mandate requiring that Russian and Belarusian athletes, coaches, government, and state officials can only participate in the Games if they do not actively support the war or work for their countries' military or national security apparatuses. Those permitted to compete are doing so as ""Individual Neutral Athletes (AIN),"" without national titles, flags, or anthems, after providing the necessary undertakings. In India's case, race walking coach Tatiana Sibileva, jumps coach Denis Kapustin, and masseur Emira Kiseleva are still waiting for their accreditation cards due to the absence of the required undertakings, the TOI report states. Sibileva has been training race walkers Akshdeep Singh, Vikash Singh, and Paramjeet Singh Bisht, while Kapustin has been coaching triple jumper Abdulla Aboobacker. Despite not being originally part of the support staff, Kiseleva was scheduled to travel with the athletics team. The athletes and their coaches had planned to travel to Spala, Poland, for a pre-Olympic training camp. However, the Polish government required their Russian coaches to provide an undertaking that they do not support the war and have no active role in it. Sibileva and Kapustin refused to sign this undertaking, fearing backlash from the Russian government, resulting in the Polish government denying them visas. Consequently, the Athletics Federation of India decided it was pointless to send the athletes to Spala without their coaches. The race walkers and Aboobacker have remained at the Sports Authority of India's (SAI) Bengaluru center, continuing their training. They will join the other contingent members directly in Paris. There is still uncertainty about whether the Russian coaches will receive their visas for France. If not resolved, the Indian athletes may have to compete in the Paris Olympics without their coaches. Moneycontrol could not independently verify the TOI report. Neither UltraTech nor India Cements responded to ET’s requests for comment.

"Maldives President Muizzu thanks India, China for support to strengthen his country’s fragile economy",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/maldives-president-muizzu-thanks-india-china-for-support-to-strengthen-his-countrys-fragile-economy-12780405.html,World,"July 28, 2024 05:06 PM","Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu has thanked India and China for helping strengthen the Maldives' fragile economy, highlighting the importance of the two countries in addressing the Island nation's looming debt crisis and its future development. China and India provide the most assistance in repaying the country's debt, President Muizzu said on Friday at an official function held to mark the 59th anniversary of the country's independence. ""I thank the Chinese government and the Indian government on behalf of the Maldivian people for their cooperation with this effort to strengthen the economy, to assure our economic sovereignty, for the sake of the Maldivian people,"" Muizzu was quoted as saying by Maldivian news portal adhadhu.com. Muizzu came to power last year on an anti-India campaign plank seeking the removal of around 80 Indian military personnel operating helicopters and Dornier aircraft donated by India. China for its part has scaled up its relations with Maldives, since Muzzu, widely regarded as a pro-Beijing leader, took over power. Early this year, he visited China during which the two countries elevated their ties to a comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership and signed 20 agreements followed by a military assistance pact with Beijing much to the disquiet of India as Maldives is its closest neighbour located strategically in the Indian Ocean. He also permitted Chinese research vessels also regarded as “spy ships” to berth in Maldives waters after Sri Lanka banned them for a year. However, after clinching an agreement with India to replace the military personnel flying the helicopters used to evacuate the patients from a host of islands in the archipelagic nation, Muizzu warmed up to India and attended Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s swearing ceremony. He also praised Rs 400 crore assistance by India and sought to restructure debt owed to India by Maldives. The marked change in his policy towards India came as in May this year the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned the Maldives that it faces a high risk of debt distress without significant policy changes. The IMF noted that the Maldives' current account deficit is expected to remain large and that its overall fiscal deficits and public debt are projected to stay elevated. Following this, the Muizzu government sought the restructuring of loans from China. Maldives debt to China reportedly amounted to over USD 1.3 billion about which Beijing initially expressed reservations to restructure the debt. Muizzu said in his Friday meeting that China has given the green light on deferring loan repayments for five years which will be a big relief to avert Maldives falling into a similar situation faced by Sri Lanka leading to debt default. At the height of the Sri Lankan crisis, China declined to restructure loans taken by Colombo. India stepped in to bailout Sri Lanka from the crisis with about USD four billion in assistance. A large portion of the loans taken by the Maldives from China’s Exim Bank for development projects during former president Yameen’s government must be repaid in 2026, according to adhadhu.com report. The Maldives will face a serious fiscal crisis if the loans are not restructured. Technical work on restructuring the loans taken from China’s Exim Bank is ongoing, which was how President Muizzu believed that “foreign policy should be shaped to protect the country’s independence,” the report said. Muizzu also said the implementation of a free trade agreement (FTA) signed between the Maldives and China during Yameen’s government will begin in September and expressed hope to sign a similar agreement with India as well. Efforts are also underway to enter into FTAs with Turkiye and Britain. The result of implementing the FTA with China would be the elimination of tariffs for a total of 7,897 items in nine sectors, including 298 fisheries products, Muizzu said. He also said his government is working on currency swap agreements with China and India to help local businesses. This would pave the way for alleviating the dollar shortage and assuring economic sovereignty, he said. For its part, China continues to ramp up its aid to Maldives by strengthening its collaboration in key infrastructure and renewable energy projects that are vital for the sustainable development of the Maldives. Maldives Foreign Minister Moosa Zameer who was in Beijing early this week held talks with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi and other officials. During his visit, the two countries signed a Letter of Exchange on the feasibility study for the redevelopment of Male and Villimal Roads Project, a key pledge of Muizzu's government. The discussions focused on strengthening collaboration in key infrastructure projects that are vital for the sustainable development of the Maldives, the Maldivian foreign ministry said in a press release on Tuesday.

11 killed by mudslide in China as heavy rains from tropical storm Gaemi drench region,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/11-killed-by-mudslide-in-china-as-heavy-rains-from-tropical-storm-gaemi-drench-region-12780342.html,World,"July 28, 2024 01:16 PM","Eleven people were killed after a mudslide hit a house in southeastern China on Sunday as heavy rains from what remained of a tropical storm drenched the region, state media said. Elsewhere in China, a delivery person on a scooter was killed Saturday after being hit by a falling tree in Shanghai, apparently because of storm-related winds, according to The Paper, a digital news outlet. The deaths were the first in China that appear linked to Typhoon Gaemi, which weakened to a tropical storm after making landfall on Thursday. Before reaching China, the typhoon intensified monsoon rains in the Philippines, leaving at least 34 dead, and swept across the island of Taiwan, where the death toll has risen to 10, authorities said late Saturday. The mudslide struck the house about 8 a.m. in Yuelin village, which falls under the jurisdiction of Hengyang city in Hunan province, state broadcaster CCTV said in a series of online reports. An earlier report said that 18 people were trapped by the mudslide, and that six injured people had been rescued. It wasn't clear in the latest report if one other person remained missing. The reports didn't say who was staying in the house, which was was rented for temporary stays. There was no information on whether the injuries were serious. The reports said the mudslide was triggered by water rushing down the mountains from heavy rains. They didn’t mention Gaemi but the China Meteorological Administration said that rain tied to the tropical storm hit southeastern parts of Hunan province on Saturday. In Shanghai, a photo posted by The Paper showed a delivery scooter on its side mostly covered by leafy branches near the still-standing barren trunk of a tree. It said that winds from the storm were the suspected cause, and that the investigation was continuing. The wide arc of the tropical storm also was bringing heavy rain about 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) away to Liaoning province in China's northeast. Hundreds of chemical and mining companies suspended operations from Saturday as a precautionary measure and more than 30,000 people had been evacuated, the official Xinhua News Agency said. Nearly 40 trains were suspended through Thursday for safety reasons after steady rain in recent days created hazards and damaged tracks. Two more people were reported dead in Taiwan, raising the death toll to 10, the island's Central News Agency said, quoting the emergency operation center. Two others were missing, and 895 people were injured. The latest victims were a man found in a drainage ditch and another man who died in a car accident. More than 800 people remained in shelters in Taiwan as of Saturday night, and more than 5,000 households were without power. The typhoon caused nearly 1.7 billion New Taiwan dollars ($51.8 million) in damage to crops including bananas, guavas and pears; chicken and other livestock farming and oyster and other fisheries, the Central News Agency said, citing figures from the Ministry of Agriculture.

Venezuelans vote in highly charged election amid fraud worries,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/venezuelans-vote-in-highly-charged-election-amid-fraud-worries-12780295.html,World,"July 28, 2024 11:40 AM","Venezuelans will go to the polls on Sunday in the most consequential election in a quarter-century of socialist party rule, with President Nicolas Maduro confident of victory even as the opposition has attracted impassioned support and warned of possible irregularities. Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado has been the star of the coalition campaign, even after a ban on holding public office forced her to pass the torch to candidate Edmundo Gonzalez, a 74-year-old ex-diplomat known for his calm demeanor. Gonzalez has won backing even from some former supporters of the ruling party, but the opposition and observers have questioned whether the vote will be fair, saying decisions by electoral authorities and the arrests of opposition staff are meant to create obstacles. Maduro – whose 2018 reelection is considered fraudulent by the United States, among others – has said the country has the world's most transparent electoral system and has warned of a ""bloodbath"" if he were to lose. People attending Maduro's closing rally in Caracas on Thursday spoke enthusiastically of his late mentor – long-time socialist President Hugo Chavez – and said Maduro, in power since Chavez' death in 2013, was continuing his predecessor's legacy of helping the poor. ""Nicolas Maduro is building up the country and continuing the legacy of Commander Chavez,"" said Conde Miranda, 54, who traveled from southern Ciudad Guayana to attend. Others alluded to a more challenging environment. ""Maduro has done both good things and bad things, the problem is the people below him,"" said 30-year-old public employee Alejandro Goldteims. Maduro's government has presided over an economic collapse, the migration of about a third of the population, and a sharp deterioration in diplomatic relations, crowned by sanctions imposed by the United States, European Union and others which have crippled an already struggling oil industry. Maduro has said he will guarantee peace and economic growth, making Venezuela less dependent on oil income. But many Venezuelans are tired of high inflation and public service cuts. ""There is a fatigue about this 25-year path, people don't see us moving ahead, the situation is worse all the time,"" said Angel Luna, a city councilor in the central state of Carabobo, after attending an opposition campaign event this month. ""My pension doesn't stretch to anything at all,"" said Carmen Puente, 69, who is retired but sells candy to make ends meet. ""Getting old in this country is a drama, it's very sad, there is no social security."" The minimum wage is equivalent to $3.50 per month, while basic food for a family of five is estimated to cost about $500. Gonzalez and Machado, who have promised major changes and said a fresh start may motivate migrants to return, have urged people to hold ""vigils"" at polling stations. They have said they expect the military to uphold the results of the vote. Venezuela's military has always supported Maduro, a 61-year-old former bus driver and foreign minister, and there have been no public signs that leaders of the armed forces are breaking from the government. Defense Minister General Vladimir Padrino has said the armed forces will respect the outcome of the election. Twenty-two people have been arrested since Friday ""in the context of the electoral process,"" Gonzalo Himiob, the vice-president of human rights organization Foro Penal, said on X, adding that at least 15 remain detained. Some people were already lining up outside polling stations late on Saturday night, according to posts on social media. Reuters could not independently verify the reports. Venezuela's attorney general this week denied participating in political persecution and said the election should be peaceful. Public spending has grown only slightly during the campaign, analysts say, a change from past campaigns when spending was generous. Maduro says he has opened 70 public works projects, but many have been renovations of already existing schools, hospitals and roads, according to events broadcast on state television. Results could be published on Sunday night or in the following days. Polls will be open between 6 a.m. (1000 GMT) to 6 p.m.

The reshuffle, the first since the centre-left Labor Party swept to power at a general election in May 2022, marks an attempt by Albanese to refresh his team ahead of the next poll, expected in 2025. ""I would expect that this is the team that I will take to the election when it is held sometime in the future,"" Albanese said in a televised media conference in Canberra. Among a raft of ministerial changes, Albanese said Tony Burke, already arts minister, will take the key portfolios of home affairs, immigration and multicultural affairs, and cyber security. Clare O'Neil shifts from home affairs and cyber security to housing and homelessness, remaining in cabinet, while immigration minister Andrew Giles moves to skills and training, no longer in a cabinet position. Northern Territory Senator Malarndirri McCarthy will take over as minister for indigenous Australians. The appointments come after long-serving Labor ministers Brendan O’Connor and Linda Burney announced they would retire at the next election.

Indian athletics team faces hurdles in Paris Olympics preparation amid Russia-Ukraine conflict: Report,https://www.moneycontrol.com/sports/olympics/indian-athletics-team-faces-hurdles-in-paris-olympics-preparation-amid-russia-ukraine-conflict-report-article-12780221.html,World,"July 28, 2024 10:51 AM","The Indian athletics team's preparations for the ongoing Paris Olympics have been significantly disrupted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. According to a report by The Times of India, two Russian coaches and a masseur attached to the Indian athletics contingent are still awaiting the processing of their Olympic Identity and Accreditation Cards (OIACs) by the Paris Games organizing committee. Athletes and coaches typically receive a Pre-Valid Card (PVC), which, along with a valid passport, serves as an entry document to France. Upon arrival in Paris, this PVC is validated into an OIAC card, granting them access to competition venues and other essential services during the Games. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has issued a mandate requiring that Russian and Belarusian athletes, coaches, government, and state officials can only participate in the Games if they do not actively support the war or work for their countries' military or national security apparatuses. Those permitted to compete are doing so as ""Individual Neutral Athletes (AIN),"" without national titles, flags, or anthems, after providing the necessary undertakings. In India's case, race walking coach Tatiana Sibileva, jumps coach Denis Kapustin, and masseur Emira Kiseleva are still waiting for their accreditation cards due to the absence of the required undertakings, the TOI report states. Sibileva has been training race walkers Akshdeep Singh, Vikash Singh, and Paramjeet Singh Bisht, while Kapustin has been coaching triple jumper Abdulla Aboobacker. Despite not being originally part of the support staff, Kiseleva was scheduled to travel with the athletics team. The athletes and their coaches had planned to travel to Spala, Poland, for a pre-Olympic training camp. However, the Polish government required their Russian coaches to provide an undertaking that they do not support the war and have no active role in it. Sibileva and Kapustin refused to sign this undertaking, fearing backlash from the Russian government, resulting in the Polish government denying them visas. Consequently, the Athletics Federation of India decided it was pointless to send the athletes to Spala without their coaches. The race walkers and Aboobacker have remained at the Sports Authority of India's (SAI) Bengaluru center, continuing their training. They will join the other contingent members directly in Paris. There is still uncertainty about whether the Russian coaches will receive their visas for France. If not resolved, the Indian athletes may have to compete in the Paris Olympics without their coaches. Moneycontrol could not independently verify the TOI report. Neither UltraTech nor India Cements responded to ET’s requests for comment.

"Israel says Hezbollah rocket kills 12 at football ground, vows response",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/israel-says-hezbollah-rocket-kills-12-at-football-ground-vows-response-12780246.html,World,"July 28, 2024 10:33 AM","A rocket attack on a football ground in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights killed 12 people including children on Saturday, Israeli authorities said, blaming Hezbollah and vowing to inflict a heavy price on the Iran-backed Lebanese group. Hezbollah denied any responsibility for the strike, the deadliest in Israel or Israeli-annexed territory since the start of the conflict in Gaza. The attack sharply escalated tensions in the hostilities which have been fought in parallel to the Gaza war and has raised fears of a full-blown conflict between the heavily armed adversaries. The rocket struck a football pitch in the Druze village of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, territory captured from Syria by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move not recognised by most countries. ""Hezbollah will pay a heavy price, the kind it has thus far not paid,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a phone call with the leader of the Druze community in Israel, according to a statement from his office. In a written statement, Hezbollah said: ""The Islamic Resistance has absolutely nothing to do with the incident, and categorically denies all false allegations in this regard"". Hezbollah had earlier announced several rocket attacks targeting Israeli military positions. The Israeli ambulance service said 13 more people were wounded by the rocket that hit the soccer pitch which was filled at the time with children and teenagers. ""They were playing soccer, they heard sirens they ran to shelter…it may take them like 15 seconds (to reach the shelter). But they couldn't reach the shelter because the rocket hit the site between the ground and the shelter,"" said Mourhaf Abu Saleh, a witness. Footage posted on social media showed the moment the rocket hit. An air raid siren can be heard, followed by a big explosion and images of smoke rising. Reuters was able to independently verify the location with the buildings and road layout that matched the satellite imagery of the area. Idan Avshalom, a medic with the Magen David Adom ambulance service, said first responders arrived to a scene of great destruction. ""There were casualties on the grass and the scene was gruesome,"" he said. Netanyahu, already due to head back from the United States to Israel overnight on Saturday, said he would bring his flight forward and convene his security cabinet upon arrival. The United States, which has been leading diplomatic efforts aimed at de-escalating the conflict across the Lebanese-Israeli border, condemned it as a horrific attack and said U.S. support for Israel's security was ""iron-clad and unwavering against all Iranian backed terrorist groups, including Lebanese Hezbollah"". The United States ""will continue to support efforts to end these terrible attacks along the Blue Line, which must be a top priority,"" the spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said in a statement. The Blue Line refers to the frontier between Lebanon and Israel. Moscow, which has ties with most of the key players in the Middle East, including Israel, Iran, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, condemned the attacks in the Golan Heights. ""We condemn all terrorist actions undertaken by any entity,"" Russian TASS state news agency cited Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as saying on Sunday. IRANIAN MISSILE The Israeli military said the rocket launch was carried out from an area located north of the village of Chebaa in southern Lebanon. Speaking with reporters at Majdal Shams, Israeli military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said that forensics showed the rocket was an Iranian-made Falaq-1. Hezbollah had earlier announced firing a Falaq-1 missile on Saturday, saying it had targeted an Israeli military headquarters. In a televised statement, Hagari also said that for now there was no change in Home Front Command instructions, indicating the army was not expecting imminent escalation across Israel. Netanyahu's far-right coalition ally, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, called for tough retaliation, including against Hezbollah's leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. ""For the death of children, Nasrallah should pay with his head. All of Lebanon should pay,"" Smotrich posted on X. The conflict has forced tens of thousands of people in both Lebanon and Israel to leave their homes. Israeli strikes have killed some 350 Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon and more than 100 civilians, including medics, children and journalists. The Israeli military said after Saturday's attack the death toll among civilians killed in Hezbollah attacks had risen to 23 since October, along with at least 17 soldiers. Andrea Tenenti, spokesperson for the UNIFIL peacekeeping force which operates in southern Lebanon, told Reuters its force commander was in contact with authorities in both Lebanon and Israel ""to understand the details of the Majdal Shams incident and to maintain calm"". A senior diplomat focused on Lebanon said all efforts were now needed to avoid an all-out war. ATTACKS FROM LEBANON Hezbollah is the most powerful of a network of Iran-backed groups across the Middle East that have entered the fray in support of their Palestinian ally Hamas since October. Iraqi groups and the Houthis of Yemen have both fired at Israel. Hamas has also carried out rocket attacks on Israel from Lebanon, as has the Lebanese Sunni group, the Jama'a Islamiya. More than 40,000 people live on the Israeli-occupied Golan, more than half of them Druze residents. The Druze are an Arab minority who practice an offshoot of Islam. The attack on the soccer pitch followed an Israeli strike in Lebanon that killed four militants on Saturday. Two security sources in Lebanon said the four fighters killed in the Israeli strike on Kfarkila in southern Lebanon were members of different armed groups, with at least one of them belonging to Hezbollah. The Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted a military structure belonging to Hezbollah, after identifying a militant cell entering the building. At least 30 rockets were then fired from Lebanon across the border, the military said. Hezbollah claimed at least four attacks, including with Katyusha rockets, in retaliation for the Kfarkila attacks.

New British Sikh MP wants to strengthen Labour’s India connection,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/new-british-sikh-mp-wants-to-strengthen-labours-india-connection-12780222.html,World,"July 28, 2024 09:57 AM","Jeevun Sandher, one of Britain’s newest members of Parliament elected in the Labour Party’s landslide general election victory earlier this month, is determined to restore trust in politics and strengthen his party’s connection with India and its diaspora communities. The British Sikh first-time MP was elected from Loughborough in the East Midlands region of England, considered a bellwether constituency which has reflected the national result in UK general elections over the years. He referenced the visit of UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy to India earlier this week as a symbol of the high level of priority the incoming government places on the relationship as it gets on with the job of “delivering change”. “From a personal perspective, I am a part of the Indian diaspora so I see it as a natural connection, for the Labour Party and the incoming Labour government,” he told PTI in an interview at the Parliament complex in London this week. “It is a hugely important strategic partnership for us, which is why David has gone out there to stress that it is an incredibly important partnership for us in the region and globally. India is the world's largest democracy, there is a trade deal in the works as well. It is about ensuring that we achieve a lot together for the mutual benefit of both nations,” he said. Sandher, in his mid-30s, was born in the eastern England town of Luton to parents who migrated from Punjab and regularly travels back to the region with his family. While these India visits will now face a few more protocol hurdles given his new parliamentary role, his work with voluntary organisations such as Labour Indians keeps him closely connected to the country of his heritage. “I think Labour Indians has helped inform policy, helped me personally as well. I'm incredibly proud of what we've achieved and look forward to achieving even more in the weeks, months and years to come,” he said of his party’s diaspora outreach. “I am really proud of my Indian roots and really proud of the way our contribution is reflected and recognised in this country. We watch football and then go for a curry, that is the country we live in and it says a lot about our culture,” he noted. As an economist and political strategist who also spent some time as a teacher in classrooms with disadvantaged children in Somaliland, Sandher feels he has been training all his life for this new challenge in the House of Commons. He has a clear-eyed vision of his key focus areas after a hectic election campaign interacting with voters in the market town of Loughborough, where he lives when he is not in London on parliamentary business. “I am an economist and the first thing for me is to get more money in people's pockets. The way we're going to do that is by investing in clean energy, bringing that investment and green prosperity into Loughborough,"" he said. ""The second priority is about the health service, there's nothing more important to any of us than the health of our loved ones and getting the highest NHS waiting list in history fixed. And thirdly, getting crime down by hiring more police officers and getting youth hubs going,” he added. Sandher believes there is a “wave of optimism” sweeping through the country since the July 4 election voted out the Conservatives after 14 years, but the focus must now be on delivery for the celebrations to “really kick in”. “There's a lot for us to do and a lot for us to fix. It is going to be really hard. I would not underestimate the scale of the challenge. This country is in its greatest crisis since 1945, it’s a real turnaround job. It's a massive mess the Tories left us with… We go into politics because we want to achieve change and now we have the chance to make that change,” said the MP, who is slowly getting to grips with a “lot to learn” in his brand-new job profile.

"Wildfire in Jasper National Park could burn for months, Canadian official says",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/wildfire-in-jasper-national-park-could-burn-for-months-canadian-official-says-12780197.html,World,"July 28, 2024 08:12 AM","A wildfire that has destroyed hundreds of structures in the town of Jasper is the largest blaze recorded in Jasper National Park in a century and could still be burning months from now, a Parks Canada official said Saturday. “We’re going to be working on this wildfire, we expect, over the next three months at least,” Landon Shepherd, a deputy incident commander, said at a news conference in the nearby community of Hinton. “What the last five years has taught us is that the fire season in Jasper tends to last well into the fall.” The region received about 1.2 centimeters (close to a half inch) of rain over about a day and a half but there were still active hot spots near the community. More than 20,000 people in and around the town nestled in the Rocky Mountains in Alberta province were ordered to evacuate late Monday due to fast-moving wildfires. Parks Canada has said 358 of the town's 1,113 structures were destroyed. In an online update, Parks Canada said fire suppression has been progressing well in the town. The federal agency said power is being restored to parts of the downtown core and to critical infrastructure, which it said would help to speed up further damage assessment and recovery. Earlier Saturday, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said on her radio call-in show that she would to see bus tours organized for evacuated residents of Jasper so they can see the damage for themselves and know what to expect when they are allowed to return home. Christine Nadon, the incident commander with the Municipality of Jasper, said conditions are not safe yet for any sort of tours due to chemicals released from burned structures and because the fire is still burning on the edge of town. “That is a plan we’re working on and will have available as soon as we can,” she said. Nadon said her own home was among the many destroyed. Smith, along with Jasper Mayor Richard Ireland and other dignitaries, toured the evacuated town on Friday. The premier told listeners Saturday she expected it would be close to 28 days before Jasper residents would be allowed to return to their town. She said it took a similar amount of time before Fort McMurray residents got the green light to go home after it was hit by a ferocious fire in 2016. Provincial wildfire officials said an estimated 17,100 Albertans are evacuated due to wildfires as of Saturday. The province said there were 157 wildfires burning across Alberta, with 44 classified as out of control, 45 being held, and 68 under control. Evacuation orders remain in effect for three communities of the Little Red River Cree Nation as well as Chipewyan Lake. More support from Ontario, Quebec, Australia, and South Africa is expected to arrive Sunday, the province said. Meanwhile, officials in British Columbia say the fire risk is improving in the province due to rain and cooler temperatures. A situational update from the BC Wildfire Service says fire behavior has reduced on some of the major fires. Cool and showery conditions are expected for the western half of the province on Sunday, reaching parts of the Interior as well. There are about 385 fires burning across the province, including six that are considered “of note” because they pose a threat to people or property or are highly visible.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will join their Japanese counterparts, Yoko Kamikawa and Minoru Kihara, at the Japan-U.S. Security Consultative Committee, known as “2+2” security talks, to reaffirm their alliance following President Joe Biden 's withdrawal from the November presidential race. For the first time, the ministers will hold separate talks to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to “extended deterrence,” which includes atomic weapons — a shift from Japan’s earlier reluctance to openly discuss the sensitive issue in the world’s only country to have suffered nuclear attacks — amid growing nuclear threats from Russia and China. The ministers are expected to discuss plans to upgrade command and control structures for U.S. forces in Japan by bringing in higher-ranked officers with commanding authority to create a U.S. counterpart for Japan’s unified command currently set for inauguration in March. Japan is home to more than 50,000 U.S. troops, but a commander for the U.S. Forces Japan headquartered in Yokota in the western suburbs of Tokyo, tasked with managing their bases, has no commanding authority. Instead that comes from the Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii. The plan to upgrade USFJ’s command and control capability is designed to help smooth joint exercises and operations, officials say. Ahead of the 2+2 talks, Kihara was to meet with South Korean Defense Minister Shin Won-sik in their first bilateral defense ministerial talks in Japan in 15 years. Austin will later join them for three-way talks. Japan has been accelerating its military buildup and has increased joint operations with the U.S., as well as with South Korea, while trying to strengthen its largely domestic defense industry. Japan has significantly eased its arms export restrictions and in December accommodated a U.S. request for shipment of surface-to-air PAC-3 missile interceptors produced in Japan under an American license to replenish U.S. inventories, which have decreased due to its support for Ukraine. The ministers are also expected to discuss increased Japanese production of PAC-3 interceptors for export to the United States. Japan and the U.S. have been accelerating arms industry cooperation following an April agreement between Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Biden. The two sides have set up working groups for missile co-production and for the maintenance and repair of U.S. Navy ships and Air Force aircraft in the region. While Japan's role is largely designed to help U.S. weapons supply and keep its deterrence credible in the Indo-Pacific amid continuing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, Japanese officials say it will help strengthen the Japanese defense industry.

In his keynote address at a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, the Republican presidential nominee promised to make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet” and create a bitcoin “strategic reserve” using the currency that the government currently holds. He also promised to remove Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler if elected and implement a crypto advisory council, teasing the crowd by asking attendees if anyone wanted to join. “We will have regulations, but from now on the rules will be written by people who love your industry, not hate your industry,” he said. Trump's keynote address at the Bitcoin 2024 conference showed how radically his position on cryptocurrency has changed over time. He was not always a fan of cryptocurrencies, writing on social media in 2019 that their “value is highly volatile and based on thin air.” He has embraced the digital currency in recent years, and in May, his campaign began accepting donations in cryptocurrency. Throughout the nearly 50-minute speech, Trump repeatedly sought to contrast his support of cryptocurrency to the Biden's administration efforts to regulate the industry, telling the crowd that the federal government was “blocking your way.” Trump said he wanted cryptocurrency “mined, minted and made” in the United States. The former president appealed to bitcoin fans by pointing to US law enforcement seizures of the digital token. “They took it away from you,” he said. “So, as I take steps to transform that vast wealth into a permanent national asset to benefit all Americans, today I repeat my promise to commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht.” Ulbricht created the underground drug-selling website Silk Road but was sentenced to life in prison after a judge held him responsible for six overdose deaths linked to his website. Some of the nearly 800 attendees who flocked to downtown Nashville to hear Trump speak wore “Free Ross Day One” hats, in a nod to Ulbricht's prison sentence. Tennessee's US Sen. Marsha Blackburn called Trump's announcement of a bitcoin strategic reserve a “historic moment.” Trump's remarks came a day after independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. addressed the conference and also pitched launching a strategic bitcoin reserve.

(After the first presidential debate) there was almost a sense of, 'Oh gosh, this was ours to win, and it's now his to win'. Then, the assassination attempt. You add those two events together, and there was a definite sense of malaise. I call it; We were paralysed. We didn't know (what to do),” Shekar Narasimhan, chairman and founder of the Asian American Pacific Islanders (AAPI) Victory Fund, told PTI in an interview. He was speaking about incumbent President Joe Biden's stumble in his first televised presidential debate with his predecessor, Donald Trump, and the recent assassination attempt on the 78-year-old former president who escaped it with an injury to his ear. “You could sense that the momentum had been taken away. This one change of putting Harris on the ticket as the presidential nominee with the Democratic Party nomination changes everything,"" said Narasimhan, a major grassroots organiser, and fundraiser for the party for the past several decades. ""The whole game is different, and the energy level is different. The money and donors are different. The grassroots is different,"" he said days after Harris, 59, became the presumptive presidential nominee of the Democratic Party. Last Sunday, Biden, 81, announced that he was withdrawing from the presidential race and endorsed Harris to be on top of the ticket for the November 5 general elections. Harris then announced that she was running for the presidency, gaining the support of the top party leadership and the majority of the delegates from across the country, making her the presumptive nominee in less than 72 hours. During the same period, she raised a record USD 30 million from thousands and hundreds of people at the grassroots level. On Saturday, she officially signed her forms, declaring her candidacy for the post of President of the US, voicing confidence that she would win the high-stakes election on November 5. She is, however, yet to be officially declared the presidential candidate by the Democrats. “It feels like everything has changed in just five days. The first 24 to 72 hours were like drinking from a fire hose, just trying to keep up with developments,"" Narasimhan said. ""The last two (days) have been a little bit more sober but about activation and mobilisation. So, what is some of the evidence? I mean, there are organic calls being organised by women. South Asian women as an example. There was a call which had 9,000-10,000 people. They raised money, they got volunteer sign-ups,"" he said. Harris, whose mother moved to the United States from Chennai at the age of six for higher studies and whose father is an African American who moved to the US from Jamaica, would formally be declared as the presidential nominee of the Democratic party at its once-in-four-year convention next month. She has already broken several glass ceilings and is now the first woman of colour on the ticket of a major political party. While her nomination has given an unprecedented level of energy and groundswell of support, Narasimhan, who has been involved in several presidential races for the past several decades, says that the pathway to the White House for Harris is through seven battleground states – Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and North Carolina. The ruling party, which was earlier struggling to find a pathway to get even 270 electoral college votes — the halfway mark for any candidate to be declared the winner of a presidential election — is now targeting to win between 324 to 332 electoral college votes, he said. “Earlier, to be honest with you, this was about getting to 270. How you get to 270 if you're a Democrat is you win your base, you win the blue wall, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, you're at 269. You add to that one vote from Nebraska or Maine, and you're at 270, or you add one other state. That felt like what we were playing for,"" he said. ""Guess what? We're now saying 324, 332. Let's go for the broadest mandate she can get because it will also give us the opportunity to take back the House, hold the Senate, and be able to get things done. So, I feel like the energy level has shifted, and the momentum has come to our side,” he said. At the same time, Narasimhan noted that with former president Trump being on the other side, nothing could be taken for granted. “He can try to change the dynamics of the race. He does have money. He does have support. He does have a base. I still think this is going to be a very close race,"" Narasimhan said, adding that 50,000 people in a few places will decide this election. ""Let's get there. First and foremost, can you hold your community (and) your constituency and win where you have to win? I believe we can win Nevada. I believe we can win Arizona and the blue wall. I now think North Carolina and Georgia are within reach. To me, the momentum shift is the black vote, the Latino vote, the Asian American vote,"" he said. ""Then when you put subsets behind that, it's I think we have now decidedly brought everybody on the South Asian and the Indian American. If our vote would have been 70 per cent for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, it should be 80 now. So I think we will see more turnout and a higher percentage of that turnout voting in our favour,"" Narasimhan said. The AAPI Victory Fund is one of the first of its kind SuperPac focused exclusively on building the political power of the Asian American Pacific Islander community.

Senior military officials including Army Colonel Ri Un Ryong and Navy Lieutenant Commander Yu Kyong Song made the comments ""out of surging hatred"" towards the U.S. and South Korea at a meeting on Saturday attended by Kim to celebrate the 71st Korean War armistice anniversary, according to KCNA. North Korea and the United States do not have diplomatic ties and talks over reducing tensions and denuclearising North Korea have been stalled since 2019. North Korea's state media recently said it doesn't expect that to change no matter who is next elected in the White House. While accusing the U.S. and South Korea of ""being hell-bent on provoking a nuclear war,"" the military officials vowed to strengthen war efficiency to stage an ""overwhelming attack on the enemy anytime and without delay and totally destroy them once the respected Supreme Commander Kim Jong Un gives an order."" North Korea signed an armistice agreement with the United States and China on July 27, 1953 ending hostilities in the three-year war. U.S. generals signed the agreement representing the United Nations forces that backed South Korea. North Korea calls July 27 ""Victory Day"" while South Korea does not mark the day with any major events. Hostilities ended with a truce, not a treaty, meaning the two sides are still technically at war.

Warrants have also been issued for Maninder Singh Dhaliwal, 34, who is believed to be the leader of the criminal organization responsible for the extortions. Maninder Singh Dhaliwal’s whereabouts are unknown, but police are working with federal counterparts to locate him. The Edmonton police are investigating the incidents in which the suspects used to target South Asian business owners with extortion threats. Edmonton police are investigating 40 incidents related to the extortion series, with the latest occurring on July 26 involving an arson at an apartment building in the Cavanagh neighborhood. In an official statement, Edmonton Police said, ""On Thursday, July 25, 2024, EPS and RCMP officers executed search warrants at six locations in southeast Edmonton relating to Project Gaslight. Police also arrested and charged five males and one female believed to be involved in the extortion scheme that was targeting South Asian business owners in the Edmonton area. One female, Jashandeep Kaur, 19, and five males, Gurkaran Singh, 19, Manav Heer, 19, Parminder Singh, 21, Divnoor Asht, 19 and a 17-year-old male are all facing a host of serious criminal charges.""

No light at the end of the tunnel for children of legal immigrants,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/no-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel-for-children-of-legal-immigrants-12780128.html,World,"July 27, 2024 09:27 PM","There does not seem to any light at the end of the tunnel for children of legal immigrants, a significantly large number of whom are Indian Americans who came to the US as a young kid with their parents and now risk being deported back to the country where they don’t know anyone because of them being aging out when they turn 21. There are around 250,000 of such children of legal immigrants, a significantly large number of whom are Indians. The White House on Thursday blamed the Republicans for this legislative impasse. “I talked about the bipartisan agreement that came together from the Senate where we negotiated a process to help the so-called documented Dreamers. And sadly, Republicans, and I've said this many times already at this podium today, which is that they voted it down twice. They voted it down twice,’ White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at her daily news conference. Last month led by Senator Alex Padilla, Chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety, and Representative Deborah Ross, a bipartisan group of 43 lawmakers called on Biden Administration to take urgent action to protect the more than 250,000 Documented Dreamers — children of long-term visa holders — who are at risk of aging out of their dependent status and are forced to self-deport if they are ineligible for another status. “These young people grow up in the United States, complete their education in the American school system, and graduate with degrees from American institutions,” wrote the lawmakers. “However, due to the long green-card backlog, families with approved immigrant petitions are often stuck waiting decades for permanent resident status,” they said in a letter to the Biden Administration on June 13. Last month, Improve The Dream, an organization representing these children of legal immigrants, met with over 100 congressional offices and senior administration officials. “It is disappointing to see the lack of action and associated proposed regulations deprioritized and delayed. It is time for action and I hope President Biden and the administration see the support from this bipartisan letter and show they care about one of the most bipartisan issues in Congress and rectify the mistakes of the past,’ said Dip Patel, founder of Improve The Dream comments. At the same time, he expressed gratitude for the bipartisan members of Congress leading in a letter asking for urgent administrative policy improvements and who continue to champion a permanent solution through Congress. “I was forced to start visa-hopping to be able to stay in this country when I was 20 years old, right before I aged out, as a junior at the University of Minnesota – Duluth. I am about to turn 27 this August. Soon, if my time visa-hopping was personified, they would be older than I was when I first came to the United States,” Jefrina, currently a graduate student pursuing my MBA at the Saint Mary’s University of Minnesota told PTI. She came to the US from India in 2005 at the age of 7. ""I arrived under a dependent H-4 visa. My family applied for permanent residency in 2010 when I was 12 years old, and I unwittingly fell in love with this country. In the last 19 years, Minnesota has undoubtedly become my home,” she said. ""My young adult life has been a series of temporary fixes to avoid self-deportation. I graduate from my Masters program in December, and I’m yet again at the crossroads of leaving my family, pets, friends, and a myriad of unquantifiable reasons I call Minnesota my home,"" Jefrina said. Praneetha, a Cloud Engineer based in Texas, who came to the US with her family when she was 8 years old as a dependent on her parents’ work visa, and after living in the US for more than 15 years, is left with no clear path toward permanent residency and has to hop from visa to visa in order to continue living and working in the country. Roshan was forced to leave the US last month. He was working with- an American semiconductor manufacturing company. He came to the US with his Mom and brother at the age of 10 on an H4 visa- he grew up in Boston and graduated from Boston College in 2021 with a degree in Economics. Roshan grew up in the US for almost 16 years but aged out in 2019. He had to leave the US in June without a clear path for returning, living, and working in the only country that he has truly called home. Patel said every day without action results in young adults, who have been lawfully raised in the United States by skilled workers and small business owners, to be forced to leave the country, separating them from their families and stopping their ability to contribute to the country. The administration has heard countless stories and examples of American-raised and educated STEM and health care talent (which comprises 87% of all impacted by aging-out, according to Improve The Dream’s survey) contributing in other countries now due to barriers in our legal immigration system. ""Our country is not only losing young talent who were raised and educated here, but we’re also losing many of their parents, who have years of practical experience as small business owners or in fields like medicine, engineering, and artificial intelligence. The economic case is clear and the moral case is clear. It is common sense,"" he said in response to a question. ""All major administrative actions have excluded this population from receiving benefit, despite the tools for such relief being available and being used for others. Until Congress can pass the bipartisan America’s Children Act, we need urgent action by the administration to prioritize this issue, which has bipartisan support from Congress and the general public, and clear economic benefit,"" Patel told PTI.

Kamala Harris focuses on three potential running mate candidates,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/kamala-harris-focuses-on-three-potential-running-mate-candidates-12780132.html,World,"July 27, 2024 09:14 PM","Vice President Kamala Harris is zeroing in on a group of potential running mates, as she faces a two-week dash to make the biggest decision of her nascent presidential bid. Harris is considering a wide range of vice presidential candidates from the Democratic Party’s bench, though people familiar with the process say a short list has emerged including three elected officials with nationwide appeal: Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Kevin Munoz, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, said she “directed her team to begin the process of vetting potential running mates” but declined to elaborate on the search. Harris is expected to make a selection by Aug. 7, in order to align with the party’s plan to virtually nominate a ticket by that date. Picking a vice presidential candidate will cement the Democratic standard-bearers to take on Republican nominee Donald Trump and running mate JD Vance in the November election. Harris’ sidekick can serve as a force multiplier who can campaign and raise money on her behalf, while ideally complimenting her strengths and covering any vulnerabilities. Most on Harris’ list are White, male politicians with centrist leanings who could help Harris appeal to swing-state voters, as well as business leaders and donors. They have a track record of attacking Trump and his firebrand style of politics. Walz has gained momentum with progressives, enough to vault himself into consideration, according to people familiar with the matter. Allies of Harris say chemistry between the vice president and whoever she picks is just as important as their political attributes. Harris knows firsthand the pressures of being No. 2 on the Democratic ticket and is weighing her experience as she makes a selection, according to her supporters. Harris’ ascension to become the likely Democratic nominee, after President Joe Biden’s stunning exit from the race, has accelerated what is typically a months-long vetting process of potential running mates. The pick will take place amid a furious effort by Harris to shape the Biden campaign operation in her image, define herself to voters and expand her war chest — all with roughly 100 days until Election Day. Democrats cautioned that the search must still be thorough in order to catch any red-flags. Those warnings took on new urgency as old clips emerged of Vance making disparaging comments about childless women, which have come under widespread criticism. “As the Trump team is finding out, it’s not just the legal vetting that the team has to do, but it also has to go through tweets, speeches and clips,” said Democratic strategist Karen Finney. “You want a thorough vet, and you want to go through a substantial volume of background info to give you a picture of the person.” Former Attorney General Eric Holder is leading the vetting process. Holder’s law firm, Covington & Burling LLP, has 12 to 15 files on candidates, according to one person familiar with the process, showing Harris initially cast a wide net. Shapiro is a popular governor of arguably the most important swing state, and a skilled orator who has performed strongly in rural areas, a weakness for Democrats. Walz, a former teacher and Army National Guard member, could dash Trump’s hopes of making Minnesota competitive and mirror Vance’s Midwestern appeal. Kelly’s state doubles as a battleground and border area and he has broken with Biden on immigration issues. His wife, Gabrielle Giffords, is a former congresswoman who became a gun-control activist after surviving an assassination attempt in 2011. Harris is also looking at the Biden Cabinet for options. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg are being vetted, the people said. A Harris campaign official said she is evaluating potential picks based on shared political values, including on the economy and democracy, and their ability to act as a governing partner and lead the country, if necessary. The switch from Biden to Harris has energized Democrats, who have gathered tens of thousands on organizing calls and given millions of dollars in donations since the president dropped out. The challenge for Harris is to sustain that momentum for their pick. Harris’ surrogates are fanning out to battlegrounds, including some possible running mates. This weekend, Shapiro and Walz are campaigning in their home states. Buttigieg is embarking on a tour of three ports that will take him to battlegrounds Michigan and Wisconsin. Those said to be under consideration by Harris have publicly said little about the selection process — though few have denied having interest in the job. Reporters at a Monday event on environmental grants peppered Shapiro with questions on about whether he would be picked, prompting him to respond, “are we not talking about concrete anymore?” Kelly told reporters Thursday outside the US Capitol that the selection process is not about him, “but I’ve always, always when I’ve had the chance to serve, I think that’s very important to do.” Democrats in Washington are playing a parlor game about whom they think would be best at Harris’ side. “I know the conventional wisdom is that she needs to pick a White man. I don’t disagree that having that kind of gender balance is good, but if you wanted to swing for the fences, you could do a Harris-Whitmer ticket that would excite a lot of people,” said former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle said, referring to Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who has said she wouldn’t accept if asked. Daschle added that Kelly and Shapiro would also “provide a fantastic contrast” with Vance. By late in the week, the halls of Congress were buzzing with excitement over who Harris would select. Senator Laphonza Butler, a close Harris ally, called Kelly smart and said he got into public service “for all the right reasons.” Harris’ choice, she said, “is going to come down to what is her relationship, what kind of familiarity and loyalty she feels with whoever she picks.”

Maldives resumes medical evacuations with Indian Dornier & helicopters; President Muizzu thanks Delhi,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/maldives-resumes-medical-evacuations-with-indian-dornier-president-muizzu-thanks-delhi-12780119.html,World,"July 27, 2024 09:10 PM","Maldives has resumed using a Dornier aircraft and two helicopters that were gifted by India for medical evacuations after the two nations have come to an agreement regarding the repatriation of Indian military personnel who are in charge of the three aviation platforms there, said media reports on Saturday President Mohamed Muizzu, known for his pro-China views, has expressed gratitude to India for making it possible for medical evacuation services using Indian civilian aviation personnel to resume. As reported by news portal Edition.mv, the Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF) informed local media that the supply of medical evacuation by the Dornier planes and helicopters has resumed, this time with the civilian crew sent from India. The MNDF posted on X that the two medical situations were handled on Friday night. The helicopters and Dornier planes were formerly flown by Indian military personnel, and they were halted shortly after President Muizzu took office in November of last year. Within hours of his swearing-in, President Muizzu demanded that Indian military forces be repatriated from his country, riding to power on the wave of ""India Out"" sentiments. According to an agreement between India and Maldives in February this year, all Indian military personnel were to return in batches by May 10 and India kept its word. The military personnel were replaced by civilians as India did not take back the Dornier aircraft and the helicopters it had gifted to the Maldives some years ago. According to the news source Adhadhu.com, Indians are stationed in Laamu Kadhdhoo and Seenu Gan to operate the helicopters, and in Hanimaadhoo to operate the Dornier planes. The islands are home to 76 Indians in all. It further stated that at the official ceremony of the 59th Independence Day yesterday night at the youth center, President Muizzu declared the commencement of medical evacuations using the aircraft. It was the first time a patient was transferred to Male via the India platform since civilians took the place of military soldiers. The Sun.mv news portal cited Muizzu as stating, ""I thank the Indian government for this."" According to the news source, the administration was criticized for not utilizing the Dornier or the helicopters in cases of medical crises, therefore it decided to resume operating the aircraft. It also stated that before the medical evacuations using the Dornier aircraft resumed, the Indian military helicopters in Kadhdhoo and Addu were flown on a regular basis. There has been no response from the government. The Indian government provided the helicopter, which was made by Bangalore-based Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, a public sector aerospace and defense business, to send the civilian employees. “They will manage aviation platforms in Hanimaadhoo, Kadhdhoo and Gan. Their contract expires in 2026,” Sun.mv added. The Indian peninsula is situated to the southwest of the Maldives archipelago, with Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, situated approximately 600 kilometers distant. Maldivians have been traveling to Kerala and other southern Indian states for routine medical care and even emergency care for decades. In the meantime, the Maldives launched the National Air Ambulance service a few months ago. It uses a seaplane and a modified Dash 8 aircraft. The president discussed ""Loan Restructuring and Debt Management"" later on Saturday at a ceremony commemorating the 59th anniversary of the Maldives' independence here in Male, particularly in light of its financial bilateral relations with China and India. “The President acknowledged the significant contributions of China and India in assisting with the Maldives’ debt repayment efforts. India has deferred a USD 50 million loan and provided food quotas for two more years. China has given the green light to defer loans from the Exim Bank for various development projects for the next five years, with no interest payments during this period,” Truth.mv reported. Free trade talks with the UK are also underway, and there is renewed optimism for establishing a free trade agreement with India, it said quoting the president.

""In November, our people-powered campaign will win,"" the presumptive Democratic Party candidate said, referring to her electoral battle with former president and the Republican Party's nominee Donald Trump. Harris launched her presidential campaign last Sunday, hours after President Joe Biden, 81, withdrew from the race for a second term. She is, however, yet to be officially declared as the presidential candidate by the Democrats. If elected on November 5 to succeed President Biden, Harris – the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother – would not only be the first woman, but the first Indian-American, the first Asian, the first Black woman and the first person of Jamaican descent to ascend to the office. Meanwhile, no other Democrats have announced their candidacy for the presidential race. Harris has secured endorsements from more than 40 state delegations, surpassing the number of delegates she will need to win the nomination and if that support holds, Democrats will officially nominate her for president during a virtual roll call vote early next month. Under new rules adopted by the Democratic National Committee on Wednesday, the nominee will be selected as soon as August 1, and the candidate has until August 7 to select a running mate. The party will meet for its convention in Chicago starting August 19. Harris, who was a senator from California before she was elected vice president, quickly hit the campaign trail with events in Wisconsin, Indiana and Texas. Her campaign said it raked in more than USD 130 million since she officially joined the White House race. The endorsement comes as ‘Harris for President’ kicks off a ‘Weekend of Action’ marking 100 days until Election Day (on November 5). With over 1,70,000 volunteers and 2,300 events across the battleground states, Team Harris is making its case to the voters who will decide this election about the fundamental choice they will face this November at the ballot box.

FBI says Trump was struck by bullet in assassination attempt at campaign rally,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/fbi-says-trump-was-struck-by-bullet-in-assassination-attempt-at-campaign-rally-12779957.html,World,"July 27, 2024 11:40 AM","The FBI has said that Donald Trump was hit by a bullet, or a fragment from one, fired by the would-be assassin at the former US president and Republican presidential nominee at his Pennsylvania rally earlier this month. “What struck former President Trump in the ear was a bullet, whether whole or fragmented into smaller pieces, fired from the deceased subject’s rifle,” the bureau said in a brief statement on Friday. Reacting to the FBI's statement, Trump told his supporters that he has accepted an apology from the FBI after its director informed lawmakers that the wound in his right ear following an assassination attempt might have come from a bullet. “They (FBI) apologised. We accept their apology,” Trump told his cheering supporters on Friday at Turning Point USA's ""The Believers Summit"" in West Palm Beach, Florida. Trump, 78, escaped an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania on July 13 when he was shot at while addressing an election rally. The shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, was shot dead by the Secret Service. “Did you see the FBI today apologise? They said, well, it might have been a bullet, but it might have been glass. Oh, really? Where did the glass come from? Or it might have been shrapnel. Where did the shrapnel come from? No, they then said it was a bullet,” Trump said at the rally. FBI Director Christopher Wray during a Congressional hearing earlier this week told lawmakers that they were still analysing evidence to determine what hit Trump: a bullet, shrapnel, glass or something else. On Friday, the FBI in a statement confirmed that it was a bullet. The FBI's confirmation that the former president was struck in the ear by a bullet marks its latest attempt to quell a political uproar. The new statement is the most direct yet from federal law enforcement about Trump’s injury, though it changes little in practical terms, CNN reported. Questions about Trump’s wound have stoked political backlash, as the former president has said he “took a bullet for democracy” and attacked Wray on his social media platform over his testimony. For his part, Trump has previously said that he was hit by an in-tact bullet, writing on his Truth Social platform that “it was, unfortunately, a bullet that hit my ear, and hit it hard”.

In a brand-new exhibit on Friday, a number of performers—including drag queens and a large woman wearing an aureole halo crown—parodied the famous Leonardo da Vinci painting ""The Last Supper,"" which depicts Christ and his apostles. Numerous well-known politicians from around the world, particularly those from the United States, have criticised the exhibit, claiming it is a sign of the deterioration of Western Civilization's culture. Speaking at CPAC in the US, conservative French politician and member of the European parliament Marion Maréchal cautioned foreign spectators that this divisive exhibition did not reflect French people like herself.

Kim visited memorials honouring the veterans of the 1950-53 war on Friday including the Tower of Friendship remembering the Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers who fought with the North Koreans, KCNA state news agency reported. North Korea signed an armistice agreement with the United States and China on July 27, 1953 ending the battle in the three-year war. U.S. generals signed the agreement representing the United Nations forces that backed South Korea. ""Comrade Kim Jong Un said it is the sacred mission and duty of our generation to protect the ideology and system defended by the previous generation of war victors with blood … and to build a paradise for the people,"" KCNA said. North Korea calls July 27 ""Victory Day"" even though the armistice drew a border dividing the Korean peninsula roughly equally in area and restoring balance after the two sides had made major advances back and forth during the war. South Korea does not mark the day with any major events. Festivities were held throughout North Korea to celebrate the day including banquets, a parade by the revolutionary youth vanguard and a mass dance in Pyongyang's main square attended by patriots under celebratory fireworks, KCNA said.

New York City turns to AI-powered scanners in push to keep guns out of the subway system,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/new-york-city-turns-to-ai-powered-scanners-in-push-to-keep-guns-out-of-the-subway-system-12779870.html,World,"July 27, 2024 07:26 AM","New York City is turning to AI-powered scanners in a new bid to keep guns out of its subway system, but the pilot program launched Friday is already being met with skepticism from riders and the threat of a lawsuit from civil liberties advocates who say the searches are unconstitutional. The Evolv scanner — a sleek-looking weapons detector using artificial intelligence to search riders for guns and knives — was on display at a lower Manhattan subway station where Mayor Eric Adams announced the 30-day trial. “This is good technology,” Adams said at Fulton Center near the World Trade Center. “Would I rather that we don't have to be scanned? Yes,"" he added. “But if you would speak to the average subway rider, they would state that they don’t want guns on their subway system, and if it means using scanners, then bring the scanners on.” Adams, a self-described “tech geek,” has stressed that the scanners are still in the experimental phase. The machines, already in use at baseball stadiums and other venues, will be deployed to a small number of stations and only a fraction of riders will be asked to step through them. The city has not entered into a contract with Evolv, and Adams said other companies were welcomed to pitch their own gun-detection innovations. The scanners, about 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall, feature the logo of the city's police department and a multicolor light display. When a weapon is detected, an alert is sent to a tablet monitored by a pair of NYPD officers. The system is not supposed to alert everyday items, such as phones and laptops — though a reporter's iPad case set it off Friday. The scanners drew immediate protest from civil liberties advocates. The New York Civil Liberties Union and the Legal Aid Society said they would sue the city if the technology is rolled out widely, alleging the searches violated the constitutional rights of riders. “City officials have admitted that these scanners are primarily to combat some riders’ ‘perceptions’ that they are unsafe on the subway — this is not a justifiable basis to violate the Constitution,” said NYCLU attorney Daniel Lambright. The scanners also spurred concerns from riders who said it isn't practical or plausible to subject millions of commuters to security screenings. “It’s not going to work,"" said Dre Thomas, 25, shaking his head at the device. “It’d have to be at every point in the subway. I don’t see how that’s possible. It seems to me like another way to waste taxpayer money.” Wyatt Hotis, 29, said he thought the scanners were a good idea but “not the root of the issue"" when people getting pushed onto the tracks were a bigger safety concern. Hotis instead suggested adding guardrails and barriers to the platforms, along with more officers to patrol them. Margaret Bortner, among the first riders to go through the scanner, described the 30-second process as painless — but didn't see the need to have them at every station. ""There are more important things officers should be doing,"" she said. Though there have been high-profile incidents, like a 2022 shooting on a Brooklyn train that left 10 people wounded, crime in the New York City subway system has fallen in recent years. Overall, violent crime in the system is rare, with train cars and stations being generally as safe as any other public place. So far this year, subway crime is down 8% through July 21 compared with the same period in 2023, according to police data. Last year, there were five killings in the subway, down from 10 the year prior, according to police. Adams has long discussed the possibility of adding weapons detectors to the subway system. He suggested this week that “eventually, every turnstile is going to be able to identify if someone is carrying a gun,” but doing so could require the city to deploy thousands of police officers to respond to gun alerts. Experts have also expressed doubts about the feasibility of adding the technology to the city’s sprawling subway system, which includes 472 stations with multiple ways in and out. Fulton Center, the subway hub where the mayor spoke, illustrates the challenges of deploying the detectors in a system designed to be as accessible as possible. There are multiple entrances spread out over several blocks, with dozens of turnstiles used by as many as 300,000 riders a day. During rush hour, they are often sprinting to catch a train. Anyone who wanted to bring a gun in without passing through a scanner could simply walk to another entrance or a nearby station. The CEO of Evolv, Peter George, has himself acknowledged that subways are “not a great use-case” for the scanners, according to the Daily News. Evolv has said that its scanning system uses artificial intelligence to screen up to 3,600 people per hour, quickly detecting the “signatures” of guns, knives and explosives while not alerting cell phones and other metal devices. The company has faced a spate of lawsuits in recent years, along with federal probes into its marketing practices. Evolv told investors last year that it was contacted by the Federal Trade Commission and in February said it had been contacted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as part of a “fact finding inquiry.” Earlier this year, investors filed a class-action lawsuit, accusing company executives of overstating the devices’ capabilities and claiming that “Evolv does not reliably detect knives or guns.” The company has claimed that it is being targeted by a misinformation campaign by those “incentivized to discredit the company.” New York City has experimented with a variety of security measures to ensure the protection of its vast subway system. In 2005, the NYPD ran a pilot project aimed at examining the feasibility of using explosive detection technology in the subways. Then, the department began doing random searches of people’s bags as they entered the subway system. That effort was also rolled out with much fanfare, but such bag checks — while not completely abandoned — are rare today.

"White House grants deportation reprieve to Lebanese, citing Israel-Hezbollah tensions",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/white-house-grants-deportation-reprieve-to-lebanese-citing-israel-hezbollah-tensions-12779871.html,World,"July 27, 2024 07:19 AM","The White House will offer deportation relief and work permits to an estimated 11,500 Lebanese nationals already in the U.S., due to conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, U.S. President Joe Biden said in a memo on Friday. The measure, under an authority known as Deferred Enforced Departure, will allow Lebanese nationals to remain in the U.S. for 18 months and could be renewed. The announcement comes after Vice President Kamala Harris pressured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday to help reach a Gaza ceasefire deal that would ease the suffering of Palestinian civilians, striking a tougher tone than Biden. Harris has emerged as the likely Democratic presidential nominee after Biden ended his campaign on Sunday. Israel and Hezbollah have been trading fire since Hezbollah announced a ""support front"" with Palestinians shortly after its ally Hamas attacked southern Israeli border communities on Oct. 7, triggering Israel's military assault in Gaza. Hezbollah is an Iran-backed militant group and the most powerful military and political force in Lebanon. U.S. Representative Debbie Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan, which is home to Lebanese Americans in Detroit and elsewhere, applauded the move and estimated it would cover 11,500 people. ""Michigan is home to many Lebanese Americans who continue to watch their families suffer as Lebanon faces an unprecedented economic, political, and financial disaster,"" she said in a statement. Former President Donald Trump, a Republican seeking another term in the White House, has pledged mass deportations if reelected. His campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The fighting in Lebanon has killed more than 100 civilians and more than 300 Hezbollah fighters, according to a Reuters tally. On the Israeli side, 10 Israeli civilians, a foreign agricultural worker and 20 Israeli soldiers have been killed. Tens of thousands have been evacuated from both sides of the border.

Arnault, who a day earlier had been rubbing shoulders with Tesla-owner Elon Musk at a lunch hosted by President Emmanuel Macron, followed the ceremony from his opulent Cheval Blanc hotel overlooking the Seine. Asked in an interview broadcast by CNBC on Friday why LVMH sponsored the Games, Arnault said: ""As we are the number one French company, we cannot avoid helping. ""But it has to have a sense. We are just not going to give money and say, OK, you thank us, but that's it.

The spectacle started with a dreamy break from tradition as 'Parade of Nations' kicked off the proceedings in which athletes from 205 countries and one refugee team sailed down the Seine on boats despite heavy rain, in the run-up to and during the ceremony, threatening to play spoilsport. The ceremony also gave a sweet nod to 'Hindi' as it was among the six languages used in infographics to pay tribute to the contribution of prominent French women during the segment titled 'sisterhood'. French President Emmanuel Macron declared the Games open, marking the formal beginning of competitions for the next 16 days. After keeping it a secret till the end of the ceremony that lasted four hours, French judo great Teddy Riner and sprint legend Marie-Jose Perec jointly lit the Olympic cauldron, symbolic of the most gender-neutral Games. The cauldron was attached to a giant hot-air balloon, which lifted off into the Paris night. Before that French football legend Zinedine Zidane handed the torch to Spanish tennis superstar Rafael Nadal who sailed down the Seine along with another tennis legend Serena Williams and former track star Carl Lewis. More than a dozen former French sporting greats changed hands before wheelchair-bound Charles Coste, the oldest French Olympic champion at 100, took the flame to be handed to Riner and Perec. The highlight of the unconventional and daring opening ceremony was without doubt the athletes' march on the Seine river. The show began with camera panning to French President Emmanuel Macron and International Olympic Committee head Thomas Bach after World Cup-winning football legend Zinedine Zidane was shown sprinting down the streets of Paris with the Olympic flame in a pre-recorded video. The six kilometer parade began from Austerlitz bridge and 85 boats carried more than 6800 athletes amid loud cheers from the gathered crowd. A good number of athletes also skipped the incredible show due to their competitions on Saturday. The sequence of arrivals followed the French alphabetical order. The first to arrive was the Greek contingent, for being the spiritual home of the Games, followed by the Refugee team. France, as host country, came last to a boisterous cheer from the home crowd. The 2028 Olympics host USA preceded France. Australia, which is hosting the 2032 Games came just before USA. The Indian contingent was led by two flag-bearers — two-time Olympic medallist PV Sindhu and table tennis legend A Sharath Kamal and was 84th on the call sheet. The women in the contingent were draped in sarees, while the men sported the traditional 'kurta-payjama' in the colours of the national flag. A total of 78 Indian athletes and officials participated in the ceremony. The boats passed through the iconic landmarks of the city such as the restored Cathedral of Notre Dame, which was gutted in a fire five years ago, the iconic Louvre Museum and also a few of the Games venues. In April 2019, the images of the Cathedral on fire and the fall of its spire had shocked the world. American Pop superstar Lady Gaga was among the first international artists to enthral the assembled crowd. The ceremony was helmed by artistic director Thomas Jolly. Amid the colourful proceedings, a mysterious torch-bearer also became a focus of attention as he darted around the city and its most famous landmarks, holding the flame. He also crossed the Seine from the Ile Saint-Louis on a zip-wire after the cabaret performers completed their act. Adding an element of childlike fun to the ceremony were the world-famous Minions and the missing Mona Lisa, which was ultimately found floating on Seine. The bridges dotting the parade route featured dance performances for the fans, who had gathered at different spots after more than two lakh free tickets were distributed aside from the over one lakh that were sold. A glimpse of the workshops of the Monnaie de Paris, where the medals for the Games have been forged, was presented to honour the city's famed craftsmanship. A total of 5,084 medals are being produced for 2024 edition of the Games and all of them will have a piece of the Eiffel Tower. The ceremony also had a political theme in the segment titled 'emancipation', which was an ode to the 18th century 'French Revolution', triggered by the then monarch King Louis XVI's profligacy. A figurine of his executed wife Marie Antoinette's decapitated torso was part of the act. Antoinette is infamously quoted to have said, ""Let them eat cake"", when told about the financial distress of French commoners at that time. The organisers had promised an unforgettable spectacle, overcoming unprecedented logistical and security challenges to make an entire city the venue of the ceremony. The organisers have claimed that the ceremony will be the biggest in Games history with more than 300,000 people watching on the banks of the Seine and billions tuned in on television. This is the third time Paris is hosting the Olympics after 1900 and 1924. India is being represented by 117 athletes, including 47 women, in the sporting spectacle.

The announcement was made during the ongoing 46th session of the World Heritage Committee (WHC) in Delhi. India is hosting the key UNESCO event for the first time. Saint Hilarion Monastery/Tell Umm Amer in Palestine has been inscribed on the World Heritage List and List of World Heritage in Danger, it was announced in the plenary meeting of the session. Israel has been carrying out a massive military offensive in Gaza following the unprecedented and multi-pronged attacks on Israeli cities by Hamas militants on October 7. India in November had urged both the sides to eschew violence, de-escalate the situation and create conditions for an early resumption of direct peace negotiations towards a two-state solution to the Palestine issue. Friday's inscription has raised hopes about protection of such heritage sites. The UNESCO in a statement later said that ""this decision recognises both the site's value and the need to protect it from danger"". ""In view of the threats to this heritage site posed by the ongoing conflict in the Gaza Strip, the World Heritage Committee used the emergency inscription procedure provided for in the World Heritage Convention,"" it said. In accordance with the terms of the Convention, ""its 195 States Parties are committed to avoid taking any deliberate measures likely to cause direct or indirect damage to this site, which is now inscribed on the World Heritage List, and to assist in its protection"", the world body said. The UNESCO said inclusion on the List of World Heritage in Danger automatically opens the door to ""enhanced international technical and financial assistance mechanisms to guarantee the protection of the property and, if necessary, to help facilitate its rehabilitation"". The monastery of Saint Hilarion/Tell Umm Amer, one of the oldest sites in the Middle East, was founded by Saint Hilarion and was home to the first monastic community in the Holy Land. Situated at the crossroads of the main routes of trade and exchange between Asia and Africa, it was a centre for religious, cultural and economic exchanges, illustrating the prosperity of desert monastic sites in the Byzantine period, the statement said. In December 2023, at its 18th session, the UNESCO's Intergovernmental Committee for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict had already decided to grant ""provisional enhanced protection"" to the monastery under the 1954 Hague Convention and its Second Protocol. The Palestinian delegation which included Mounir Anastas, Ambassador and Permanent Delegate of Palestine to UNESCO, thanked UNESCO for this dual inscription which seeks to bring a protective cover and world's attention to the heritage site located in areas facing conflicts. ""I am honoured to have this inscription taking place in the greatest democracy in the world. Thank you, India. I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all Committee members for their valuable support for this inscription,"" Anastas said in his statement made in the session right after the inscription. He also thanked ICOMOS, an advisory body of the UNESCO, and the Secretariat of the UNESCO. ""This decision by the World Heritage Committee and the UNESCO is a clear message of hope to our population in Gaza. This is the most important point of this inscription,"" Anastas told PTI on the sidelines of the event. Secondly, it is also a message from the UNESCO that protection of cultural heritage is a ""shared responsibility"", and mainly the world heritage sites in regions that are suffering of armed conflict, he said. Various state parties from Lebanon, Turkiye and Kazakhstan welcomed the UNESCO inscription of the heritage site in Palestine, with some of them underlining the need for cultural heritage preservation in times of armed conflicts. The nomination for the site of Saint Hilarion Monastery/Tell Umm Amer was an ""emergency nomination"". Paris-based International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) also made a presentation on this site. The nomination dossier was submitted in June 2024 followed by a ""desk review"". ""Situated on the coastal dunes in Nuseirat Municipality, the ruins of Saint Hilarion Monastery/Tell Umm Amer represent one of the earliest monastic sites in the Middle East, dating back to the 4th century,"" according to the UNESCO website. ""Founded by Saint Hilarion, the monastery began with solitary hermits and evolved into a coenobitic community. It was the first monastic community in the Holy Land, laying the groundwork for the spread of monastic practices in the region. The monastery occupied a strategic position at the crossroads of major trade and communication routes between Asia and Africa,"" it said. This prime location facilitated its role as a hub of religious, cultural, and economic interchange, exemplifying the flourishing of monastic desert centres during the Byzantine period, the world body said.

There was little major reaction to data showing the U.S. personal consumption expenditures index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, cooled slightly to 2.5% year-on-year in June. Traders' bets on two or three Fed rate cuts this year remained intact. S&P 500 futures were up 0.72%, after the index fell for a third consecutive day on Thursday to mark a 1.9% drop for the week to date. Futures for the tech-laden U.S. Nasdaq index - which has slumped 7% over the past two weeks - rose 1%. Meanwhile, Europe's continent-wide STOXX 600 index rose 0.58% and was on track to end the week 0.4% higher after losing 2.7% last week. Equity markets - which had been trading at all time highs - have seen old favourites lose some allure and others pick up over the past two weeks after some cooler U.S. economic data sparked hopes that the Federal Reserve would soon be cutting rates. Investors have snapped up smaller companies that are more closely tied to the economy and affected by borrowing costs. At the same time, they have ditched popular artificial intelligence plays such as Nvidia, helping to pull down global stocks by 1.7% this week. ""The way we can describe (this week) is an unwinding of consensus long positions in growth and AI stocks, and an unwinding of consensus long carry positions,"" said Max Kettner, chief multi-asset strategist at HSBC. Analysts said the better performance of European stocks this week compared to their U.S peers was part of the rotation out of big tech names. Other stock markets also found a footing on Friday, with Germany's DAX index up 0.46% and Britain's FTSE 100 1% higher. Japan's Nikkei fell 0.53% overnight, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng edged up 0.1%. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields dipped slightly after the inflation print to 4.221%. Shorter-dated yields, which are more sensitive to interest rate expectations, fell and were on track to end the week 10 basis points lower. YEN SLIPS BACK The Japanese yen, which has rallied around 1.8% this week, slipped from around a 12-week high as investors paused ahead of Bank of Japan and Federal Reserve interest rate decisions next Wednesday. The dollar was last up 0.3% against the yen at 154.39. Meanwhile, the index tracking the dollar against six other major currencies was little changed at 104.36, while the euro was very slightly higher at $1.0857. The yen has been driven up by expectations the Fed could cut while Japan raises rates in the coming months, as well as by suspected BOJ intervention earlier this month. The rally gathered steam this week as investors abandoned long-held bets against the yen, forcing them to buy back the Japanese currency. Data on Thursday that showed the U.S. economy grew more than expected in the second quarter helped to calm the yen rally, although did little to change traders' bets on two or three Fed cuts this year, starting in September. HSBC's Kettner said strong earnings reports from Amazon, Apple and Microsoft next week could stem the selling in stocks. ""Markets could remain a bit nervous until then."" Oil prices slipped with the global benchmark Brent crude price down 0.67% at $81.82 a barrel.

US Fed's favored inflation measure cools further in June,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/us-feds-favored-inflation-measure-cools-further-in-june-12779677.html,World,"July 26, 2024 06:22 PM","The US Federal Reserve's favored inflation measure eased further in June, according to government data published Friday, in more good news for policymakers ahead of next week's interest rate decision. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index eased to an annual rate of 2.5 percent in June, the Commerce Department said in a statement, down slightly from 2.6 percent a month earlier. This was in line with the median forecast of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal. While the June data is sure to be viewed as a positive development, inflation still remains stuck above the Fed's long-term target of two percent. At the same time, the labor market appears to be moving into better balance between job seekers and job creators, and the economy remains in robust health, growing at an annualized rate of 2.8 percent in the second quarter of the year, according to data published earlier this week. In recent weeks US central bank policymakers have been sounding more optimistic about the chances of an interest rate cut, even as they have continued to urge patience until the data supports such a move. ""We've said that you don't want to wait until inflation gets all the way down to two percent, because inflation has a certain momentum,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers in Congress earlier this month. ""If you waited that long, you've probably waited too long,"" he added. Stripping out volatile food and energy prices, the closely watched core measure of inflation eased to an annual rate of 2.6 percent in June -- also in line with expectations.

She called on the global community to denounce Tel Aviv's actions and ""force them to stop"". ""It is no longer enough to speak up for the civilians, mothers, fathers, doctors, nurses, aid workers, journalists, teachers, writers, poets, senior citizens and the thousands of innocent children who are being wiped out day after day by the horrific genocide taking place in Gaza,"" the Congress leader said in a post on X. She said it is the moral responsibility of every right thinking individual including all those Israeli citizens who do not believe in hatred and violence, and every government in the world, to condemn the Israeli government’s genocidal actions and force them to stop. The Congress general secretary's comments came after Netanyahu defended Israel's ongoing war in Gaza during a speech to the US Congress this week. Netanyahu received a warm welcome from House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republican lawmakers who arranged his speech in the chamber. He also received a bipartisan standing ovation. Their actions are unacceptable in a world that professes civility and morality, Priyanka Gandhi said. ""Instead, we are subjected to the image of the Israeli Prime Minister being given a standing ovation in the US Congress,"" she said. ""He (Netanyahu) calls it 'a clash between barbarism and civilisation'. He is absolutely correct, except that it is him and his government that are barbaric and their barbarism is being given the unstinted support of most of the western world. It is truly a shame to watch,"" Priyanka Gandhi said. The Congress leader has been raising her voice against Israel's actions in Gaza and expressing solidarity with Palestinians. Hamas-led fighters triggered the war on October 7 by storming into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 captives, according to Israeli tallies. Hamas and other militants are still holding 120 hostages and Israel believes around a third of them are dead. More than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military offensive on Gaza since October 7, according to the Gaza health ministry.

Bank of America says cooling economy will crack big tech rally even more,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/bank-of-america-says-cooling-economy-will-crack-big-tech-rally-even-more-12779636.html,World,"July 26, 2024 05:45 PM","The rally in the biggest US technology stocks is at risk of fading further if the US economy continues to cool, according to Bank of America Corp.’s Michael Hartnett. The strategist — who is bullish on bonds for the second half of 2024 — has said signs of an economic slowdown would fuel a rotation into stocks that have lagged behind the pricey tech mega-caps this year. In a note on Friday, Hartnett said recent data suggested the global economy was “ill,” and that “we are one bad payroll away” from big tech stocks losing their dominance.  The upward trajectory of technology stocks including Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. has been derailed in the past two weeks as investors flocked into small caps on bets that the Federal Reserve could begin cutting rates soon. About $2.6 trillion has been erased from the market capitalization of firms in the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index since it hit a record on July 10, also fueled by worries that big investments in artificial intelligence may not pay off any time soon. Still, BofA’s Hartnett said equity bulls were holding on to the belief that a correction was “healthy” as the market hadn’t fallen below critical levels. The Nasdaq 100 has dropped about 9% since July 10, but it’s still up more than 30% since hitting a low in October 2023. US equity futures advanced on Friday, putting them on track to recoup some losses. The bank’s custom bull-and-bear indicator edged up to 6.9 in the week through July 24 to the highest in over three years. A reading above 8 would flash a contrarian sell signal — which could be triggered if fund managers’ equity allocations rise and cash levels decline further, and a rally in the laggards leads to an improvement in market breadth, Hartnett said.

Musk, the world’s richest man, recently alleged in an interview that Wilson was ""killed"" by a ""woke mind virus"" and that he had been tricked into signing documents for her during the pandemic. He referred to gender-reassignment surgery as ""child mutilation and sterilisation"". Wilson responded in a lengthy thread on Threads, the Meta-owned rival to Musk's platform X, refuting his statements.She said, ""I disowned him, not the other way around."" Wilson also shared a screenshot of an online post by Musk claiming she was born ""gay and slightly autistic"", which he argued contributed to her gender dysphoria. Musk wrote, ""I knew that from when he was about 4 years old and he would pick out clothes for me to wear like a jacket and tell me it was 'fabulous!', as well as his love of musicals & theatre. But he was not a girl."" Wilson shot back, ""This is entirely fake. Like, literally none of this ever happened. Ever. I don't even know where he got this from. My best guess is that he went to the Milo Yiannopoulis school of gay stereotypes, just picked some at random and said 'eh- good enough' in a last-ditch attempt to garner sympathy points when he is so obviously in the wrong even in his own fu**ing story."" She denied ever picking jackets for Musk or using the word ""fabulous"" at the age of four. ""I was most certainly not calling them ""fabulous"" because literally what the f**k. I did not use the word fabulous when I was four because once again I would like to reiterate... I was four,"" she added. Wilson claimed Musk was absent during her childhood, stating, ""This entire thing is completely made up and there's a reason for this. He doesn't know what I was like as a child because he quite simply wasn't there, and in the little time that he was I was relentlessly harassed for my femininity and queerness. Obviously he can't say that, so I've been reduced to a happy little stereotype f*g-ing along to use at his discretion. I think that says a lot about how he views queer people and children in general."" Addressing her gender, Wilson clarified, ""I'm legally recognised as a woman in the state of California and I don't concern myself with the opinions of those who are below me. Obviously Elon can't say the same because in a ketamine-fuelled haze, he's desperate for attention and validation from an army of degenerate red-pilled incels and pick-mes who are quick to give it to him."" Earlier this month, Musk discussed Wilson in an interview with conservative commentator Jordan Peterson, accusing those promoting gender-affirming care of targeting children ""who are far below the age of consent."" He claimed, ""I was tricked into doing this. I lost my son, essentially. They call it 'deadnaming' for a reason. The reason they call it 'deadnaming' is because your son is dead."" Musk said this experience motivated him to combat the ""woke mind virus,"" stating, ""I vowed to destroy the woke mind virus after that. And we're making some progress."" Vivian Jenna Wilson legally changed her name and gender at the age of 18 and asserted that she does not wish to be related to Musk, her biological father.

In the video, Vance controversially proposed that parents should have greater voting rights than those without children. Vance made this suggestion during a speech to the 'Intercollegiate Studies Institute,' arguing that people without children have no ""investment"" in the future of America. He also remarked that those without children ""maybe shouldn't get nearly the same voice."" Vance, the running mate of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, has faced widespread public condemnation for his 'childless cat ladies' remark. In his 2021 Fox News interview, he targeted Kamala Harris, now the Democratic Presidential nominee, along with other Democratic leaders, claiming that those without offspring, especially ""childless cat ladies,"" had no ""direct stake"" in the country. Vance told Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson that the United States was being run by “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.” Kamala Harris has two stepchildren, Cole and Ella, from her husband Doug Emhoff's previous marriage to Kerstin Emhoff. While Harris's lack of biological children has faced criticism from Republicans, she has received support from politicians, celebrities, and her family. Vance's comments have also drawn criticism from Jennifer Aniston. Despite her usual preference for privacy, Aniston condemned Vance's extreme views on reproductive rights, highlighting her public journey through infertility. “All I can say is… Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,” Aniston wrote in her post. “I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too,” she added.

Chief Executive Officer Francesco Milleri made the comments about Meta’s interest during a call with analysts late Thursday, after weeks of speculation about the Facebook owner’s plans. A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment. EssilorLuxottica shares rose as much as 8.1% in Paris on Friday, the biggest increase in more than two years. The two companies have already been working together for years, and presented their first Ray Ban-Meta smart glasses in 2021. A deal with EssilorLuxottica would mark a further push by Meta into the virtual and augmented reality market for smart glasses, while boosting the eye-wear maker’s visibility and access to new markets and fresh capital. “We are proud that a company that knows us very well, after years of partnership, is convinced that our company can grow and do much better in the future,” Milleri said. Bloomberg reported earlier this month that Facebook is considering taking a stake of up to 5% in EssilorLuxottica. Milleri added Thursday that if the US firm decides to invest, it will have to buy shares on the market. He didn’t elaborate on the size of the stake Meta may buy and on the timing of the purchase. Other competitors are also active in the space: Snap Inc. has been experimenting with mixed-reality spectacles for years while Apple Inc. released the Vision Pro headset earlier this year. The world’s biggest manufacturer and retailer of eyewear posted adjusted net income of €1.75 billion ($1.9 billion) in the first half, 10.6% higher compared to the same period last year. Revenues were in line with analysts’ forecasts at €13.3 billion. Performance in Europe, Middle East and Africa, where revenue jumped 7.9% in the second quarter compared to the same period a year prior, offset lower growth in North America, held back by a decline in comparable-store sales at Sunglass Hut, the company said in a statement on Thursday. EssilorLuxottica and Meta have been cooperating on smart glasses for a few years. In 2021, Meta unveiled its first Ray-Ban smart glasses set on the Wayfarer frame to let users take photos and videos, listen to music and answer calls. Newer glasses incorporate MetaAI, an artificial intelligence assistant based on its Llama AI model.

German automakers have been struggling with lacklustre demand for EVs, coupled with tough local competition in China, supply bottlenecks and persistently high interest rates. Mercedes said it expects plug-in hybrid sales to rise in the second half of 2024 as the industry in Europe and the U.S. sees stronger demand for hybrid models, while EV sales have lagged expectations. The carmaker expects an adjusted return on sales in the range of 10-11% this year, down from its previous target range of 10-12%. The lower outlook sent the company's shares down 1.4% in early trading. Bernstein analysts wrote in a client note that while some investors had expected a profit warning, Mercedes merely trimming its margin forecast ""will likely be met with relief."" The company's cars division achieved a 10.2% return on sales in the second quarter, while its adjusted earnings came in below analyst expectations. Mercedes reported a 6% drop in sales in the first half, with electric vehicle sales falling 17%. ""Overall, Mercedes execution has recovered, but overall sales, and top end sales mix have remained weak,"" Citi analysts wrote in a client note. Mercedes said the economic outlook was marked by uncertainty, adding that it saw improving market sentiment in Europe and ""solid momentum"" for sales and demand in the U.S. market. However, it has a ""cautious view"" on China, where it expects strong competition in its entry-level and core model segments, while it ""seeks to successfully defend its leading position"" of top-end car models. CEO Ola Kaellenius told investors in a conference call that the automaker will continue its flexible approach to offer consumers both fossil-fuel and electric models based on demand. But he said the company has to compete with EVs in China because of the pace of adoption of electric models in the world's largest car market. ""That's a race you've got to be in,"" Kaellenius said. The group reported a 27.5% fall in adjusted earnings in its car division in the second quarter, against LSEG's estimate of a 26% decline.

China weighs tenfold fee increase on high-frequency traders,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/china-weighs-tenfold-fee-increase-on-high-frequency-traders-12779282.html,World,"July 26, 2024 01:15 PM","China is considering a fee hike of at least tenfold on high-frequency trading, its latest attempt to rein in some quantitative strategies deemed by regulators as a threat to fairness in the nation’s retail investor-dominated stock market. The China Securities Regulatory Commission and the country’s stock exchanges have consulted some market participants on draft plans to raise a 0.1 yuan (1.4 cents) fee on buy and sell orders to at least 1 yuan if the transactions meet the threshold of high-frequency trading, according to people familiar with the matter, who requested not to be named as the discussions were private. Regulators also floated the possibility of granting exemptions if an account’s monthly turnover rate is lower than four times its total holdings, a level that would help avoid unwanted impact on mutual funds that also use computer programs to generate automated trades, the people said. Revisions are still being made and the final version could be subject to change, they added. The proposals follow up on new rules earlier this year for programmed transactions, with officials pledging to slow high-frequency trading by raising costs. A significant hike in fees will further dent the returns of some quantitative hedge funds, which are already reeling from crackdowns that include stringent curbs on short selling earlier this year. The CSRC didn’t immediately respond to a request seeking comment. Programmed trading accounts for about 29% of China’s stock market turnover and such investors hold about 5% of the domestic A shares, according to the CSRC. While programmed trading can improve market liquidity, it gives traders “obvious” advantages in technology, information and speed over smaller investors and could amplify volatility at certain points, the CSRC told reporters at a briefing in April. Officials have imposed additional reporting requirements on high-frequency traders and pledged to raise fees to curb their “excessive advantages” and maintain market fairness. The country’s top quant funds have defended the industry by publishing rare articles this month in response to “misconceptions” about the sector. China’s stock exchanges have defined high-frequency trading as more than 300 orders and cancellations per second through one account or more than 20,000 requests in a single day. Such accounts have dropped 20% this year to about 1,600 as of June 30, the CSRC has said. The proposal suggests that once an order is identified as “high-frequency,” exchanges can raise the 0.1 yuan fee to at least 1 yuan, the people said. The fee on canceled trades will be lifted from 0.1 yuan to 5 yuan, they said. China’s 1.6 trillion yuan quant hedge fund industry is facing growing headwinds this year amid a falling stock market, with some researchers stepping up calls in recent days to ban algorithmic trades outright. A top-performing hedge fund was banned in February from opening stock index futures positions for 12 months after it used high-frequency trading to circumvent transaction limits. High-frequency trading accounts for a small proportion of quants’ combined assets under management, and such strategies’ share will only fall further amid tightened supervision, Zhejiang High-Flyer Asset Management, one of the largest quants, wrote on its Wechat account last week. Quants trading A shares on the mainland typically replace the entire holdings every one to three weeks, which amounts to an annual turnover of 35 times to 105 times, it said. More than 100 mutual fund firms also manage quant funds, with Fullgoal Fund Management Co. running more than 30 billion yuan of such products as of Sept. 30, according to a Haitong Securities Co. report in December. They often face more trading restrictions compared with hedge fund rivals, stricter risk control and significantly higher trading costs, the report said. China’s commodities exchanges earlier ended rebates paid on some automated trades, which would already have had an impact on high-frequency trading in that market, Bloomberg reported in January.

The storm has led to extensive evacuations, infrastructure damage, and severe flooding, impacting Taiwan, the Philippines, and China. Gaemi first struck Taiwan, causing significant damage with landslides and flooding. The typhoon resulted in three fatalities and numerous injuries. In response, schools and offices were closed, and residents were advised to stay indoors. The storm’s effects were felt across the Philippines as well, where it triggered severe flooding and landslides, claiming at least 20 lives and leaving several people missing. Upon reaching Fujian province in eastern China, Gaemi, moving at around 20 kilometers per hour, prompted the evacuation of over 290,000 residents. Public transport, offices, schools, and markets were suspended as a precautionary measure. Although the typhoon weakened upon landfall, it still brought heavy rains, leading to significant disruptions in Fujian and nearby Zhejiang province. Flooded streets and infrastructure damage were reported, with the city of Wenzhou issuing its highest rainstorm warning and evacuating nearly 7,000 people. Authorities in China remain on high alert as Gaemi continues its northwestward trajectory, expected to weaken further but still pose risks of heavy rainfall in Jiangxi and Henan provinces. President Xi Jinping chaired a high-level meeting urging local authorities to remain proactive in protecting citizens during the peak of the flooding season exacerbated by extreme weather conditions. The crisis was compounded by the sinking of an oil tanker off Manila, which carried 1.4 million liters of oil. Efforts to prevent an environmental disaster are underway as authorities work to offload the cargo and manage the situation. As of now, no casualties have been reported in mainland China, but the situation remains dynamic. Local communities and authorities are bracing for further impacts from Typhoon Gaemi as it continues to affect the region. (With inputs from agencies) ",NEGATIVE

Unlike previous years, which focused on public displays, this year's five-day exercise, beginning on 22 July, prioritises rigorous combat simulations. Night-time drills, severed command lines, and shelter-in-place scenarios are central to the exercise, which aims to test the island's ability to withstand a full-scale Chinese invasion. Scenarios include establishing alternative command centres and repelling simulated amphibious landings on Taiwan's western coast. China has significantly increased military activity around Taiwan this month, including a record number of aircraft incursions. Beijing views the self-governing island as part of its territory. Following President Lai Ching-te's inauguration in May, China conducted military exercises around Taiwan, citing Lai's separatist rhetoric as justification. Amid escalating Chinese pressure and intensified grey-zone tactics, Taiwan adjusted its Han Kuang exercises to address the challenges posed by Beijing's actions. On 11 July, Taiwan's defence ministry reported detecting 66 Chinese military aircraft operating around the island within 24 hours, marking the highest number of sorties in a single day in 2024. The previous day, 10 July, Taipei announced that China's aircraft carrier Shandong had been observed sailing through waters near Taiwan to participate in military exercises in the western Pacific. The Han Kuang exercises, initiated in 1984, typically culminate in a week of public demonstrations.

"Mexican drug lord 'El Mayo' and El Chapo's son arrested in Texas, U.S.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/mexican-drug-lord-el-mayo-and-el-chapos-son-arrested-in-texas-u-s-12779146.html,World,"July 26, 2024 12:17 PM","In a major coup for the U.S. authorities, the police on Thursday arrested Mexican drug kingpin Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada and the son of his ex-partner, Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman in El Paso, Texas. Zambada, who was extradited to the United States in 2017 and is serving a life sentence in a maximum security prison, was detained along with Guzman Lopez after landing in a private plan in the El Paso area, Reuters reported citing two U.S. officials. Zambada is one of the most consequential traffickers in Mexico's history and co-founded the Sinaloa Cartel with El Chapo Both Zambada and Joaquin Guzman Lopez, face multiple charges in the U.S. for funneling huge quantities of drugs to U.S. streets, including fentanyl, which has surged to become the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 18 and 45. Guzman Lopez is one of four sons of El Chapo -- known as Los Chapitos, or Little Chapos -- who inherited their father's faction of the Sinaloa Cartel. His brother, Ovidio Guzman, was arrested last year and extradited to the United States. In recent years, the Sinaloa Cartel has become the biggest target for U.S. authorities, who have accused the crime syndicate of being the biggest supplier of fentanyl to the United States. In an official statement, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said ""Zambada and Guzman Lopez face multiple charges in the U.S. for heading the Cartel’s criminal operations, including its deadly fentanyl manufacturing and trafficking networks."" One worker at the Santa Teresa airport, near El Paso, on Thursday afternoon told Reuters that he saw a Beechcraft King Air land on the runway, where federal agents were already waiting. ""Two individuals got off the plane… and were calmly taken into custody,"" said the man, who declined to share his name out of concern for his safety. ""It seemed like a pretty calm, arranged thing,"" he added. The U.S. authorities had a $15 million reward for Zambada's capture, while Guzman Lopez had a $5 million bounty on his head. The Sinaloa cartel traffics drugs to more than 50 countries around the globe and is one of two most powerful organized crime groups in Mexico, according to U.S. authorities. Zambada and El Chapo's sons belong to two different generations of traffickers, with differing styles. Zambada is known for being an ""old-school"" narco, avoiding the limelight and operating in the shadows. El Chapo's sons, by contrast, have a reputation for being flashy narcos who courted attention as they ascended the ranks of the cartel. El Chapo's sons are also known to be more violent and hot-headed than Zambada, who had a reputation as a shrewd operator. Zambada and El Chapo's sons have had a fractious relationship since their father was extradited in 2017, and the arrests of Zambada and Guzman Lopez may trigger instability or even violence in their heartlands in the northern state of Sinaloa. Previous arrests of important cartel leaders has triggered violence as power vacuums open, leading to significant infighting within the organizations and between them and their rivals. ""This possibility certainly looms very large,"" said Vanda Felbab-Brown, a researcher at Washington's Brookings Institution who closely monitors Mexican security. Their arrests were part of a joint operation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agencies, HSI said in a statement. U.S. authorities have over the past year launched fresh indictments against Zambada and Guzman's sons on new charges in the United States that focus on fentanyl smuggling, as well as the flow of precursor chemicals to the illicit labs operated by their crime syndicate. Over decades, the cartel has set up sophisticated supply chains to move drugs across the globe and to source heavily regulated chemicals to their home base in Sinaloa. Earlier in the day on Thursday, Reuters published an investigation that revealed how fentanyl precursor chemicals are astonishingly easy and cheap to buy online from Chinese sellers that ship the substances door-to-door in North America. ""Fentanyl is the deadliest drug threat our country has ever faced, and the Justice Department will not rest until every single cartel leader, member, and associate responsible for poisoning our communities is held accountable,"" Garland added.

‘Crazy’ Yen rally is at risk of shattering as soon as next week,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/crazy-yen-rally-is-at-risk-of-shattering-as-soon-as-next-week-12778767.html,World,"July 26, 2024 08:11 AM","Investors have fallen over each other in recent weeks to buy the yen on bets that interest rates are finally about to tip in Japan’s favor. They face a moment of truth as soon as Wednesday. The currency is holding onto an advance of about 5% against the dollar since just before it began surging on July 11, in a move that was amplified by suspected intervention by Japan. Some investors warn that the rally is fragile, as was on show overnight when the yen rapidly retraced gains after stronger-than-expected US economic growth figures. Swaps markets suggest a 38% chance of the Bank of Japan hiking rates by 15 basis points by the conclusion of its July 31 policy meeting, indicating plenty of caution. And only 30% of BOJ watchers surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a hike, even if more than 90% see it as risk. That leaves yen bulls vulnerable, particularly if the BOJ also disappoints expectations for a sizable cut in bond purchases, or if the Federal Reserve later in the day does anything to damp hopes for rate cuts in the US in coming months. “This is a crazy yen rally,” said Nick Twidale of ATFX Global Markets, who has traded Japan’s currency for a quarter of a century. “The BOJ could be party poopers and not play their part in tightening policy.”  Twidale said that if the BOJ underwhelms the market, carry trades that have kept the yen weak “may come back with a vengeance.” Others from BlackRock Inc. to former central bank officials are predicting the BOJ will stand pat on interest rates for longer. Patchy economic data lend credence to this view: while a key gauge tracking the strength of Japan’s service sector rebounded in July, a measure of factory activity showed a contraction. Weak consumer spending is further complicating the BOJ’s decision next week, people familiar with the matter say. “If BOJ does nothing, the dollar-yen rate could surge again,” said Amir Anvarzadeh, strategist at Asymmetric Advisors who has tracked Japanese markets for over three decades. The yen swung between small gains and losses Friday. It was little changed at 153.96 per dollar at 10:15 a.m. in Tokyo, after inflation figures for Tokyo earlier showed that consumer prices accelerated for a third month. Nathan Swami, managing director of FX trading at Citigroup Inc. in Singapore, saw additional demand for bullish yen options after the outsized move this week. “It is still too early to tell if this signals a longer-term investor sentiment shift, and may thus more likely be a tactical shift in short-term positioning or hedging activities for now,” he said. According to other traders, some hedge funds remained on the sidelines amid uncertainty over how much the currency could gain ahead of next week’s BOJ policy meeting. If the BOJ “doesn’t fully deliver,” then the yen could weaken toward the 158 level against the dollar, according to National Australia Bank Ltd.’s Rodrigo Catril. Yet even if the BOJ does tighten policy on Wednesday, there is still a case for it to retain favor in carry trades, in which investors take advantage of Japan’s ultra-low interest rates to borrow in yen to then invest in currencies with higher yields. The yen’s implied yields would still be about 90 basis points lower after a hike than those for the Swiss franc, which is an alternative funding currency for carry trades.  US rates risk also abound. Should the odds of Fed rate cuts retreat, Japan’s currency could come under attack once more. “The yen can test 160 if the Fed doesn’t signal a September rate cut and US data starts to strengthen again,” said Charu Chanana, head of currency strategy at Saxo Capital Markets.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has steered an effort to repair the island nation's ruined finances, will face at least two rivals campaigning against austerity measures imposed under an International Monetary Fund bailout plan. The commission said in a gazette notification that candidate nominations will be accepted on August 15 for a September 21 poll. Its schedule sets out a five-week campaign in a country still struggling with a fragile economic recovery and endemic discontent over cost of living issues. More than 17 million Sri Lankans over the age of 18 are eligible to vote. Opposition parties have vowed to renegotiate terms of the $2.9 billion IMF bailout Wickremesinghe negotiated in early 2023. Economic reforms are expected to dominate the campaign as the country emerges from its worst-ever recession in 2022, when the GDP shrank by a record 7.8 percent.

It's not helpful. I mean, we're talking about a liberal senator who literally has not accomplished very much and what she was given she didn't do much with. You don't need to talk about what she looks like or what gender she is to talk about that. The American people are smarter than that,” Haley told CNN in an interview. She was responding to a question on the attack on Harris based on the colour of her skin and gender. “Talk about the fact that she doesn't believe in fracking. Tell that to the voters in Pennsylvania. Talk about the fact that she doesn't want to talk about paying down debt. She wants to increase taxes. Tell that to the American people. Talk about the fact that consumer prices have gone up 19.5% since Joe and Kamala were in office,” she said. “Talk about the fact that she's always sided with the Palestinian protests instead of our friend Israel. There are so many issues we can talk about when it comes to Kamala Harris. It doesn't matter what she looks like. It matters what she said, what she's fought for, and the lack of results that she's had because of it,” Haley said. The former Republican presidential candidate, who lost to Donald Trump in the primary race, said she was not surprised when Democratic nominee and incumbent President Joe Biden dropped out of the race, paving the way for Harris to be on the party’s ticket. “I wasn't surprised and I didn't take happiness in it. Through the whole campaign, I fought for mental competency tests. I wasn't doing it to be disrespectful. I wasn't doing it to be mean. I was doing it because I think it's not just Joe Biden. There is an issue that we have in DC where people will go into office and they won't let go. And then their staffers and their family keep propping them up and it's a problem for the American people,” she said. “So, I never thought he would make it to the election. I always said a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for Kamala Harris, and I think that's what's playing out,” she said. Haley, the former South Carolina Governor and US Ambassador to the United Nations, said the Democrats are very smart to put in a younger candidate. “I think that that's what America has craved. But I think what you look at is they put in the weakest candidate they could put in,” she said. “You look at the fact that Kamala.. she had one job. That was to deal with illegal immigration and the border. She didn't do it. She was the most progressive Senator that we had next to Bernie Sanders. You can see it playing out, whether it's the fact that she didn't show up at Bibi's speech yesterday, whether it's the fact that she pushed for all this government spending, whether it's the fact that when she was in California, the most liberal state, there was no tax she didn't propose. There was nothing that she didn't want to see,” Haley said. “All of her, the things she's doing from not wanting fracking to not wanting oil drilling, all of these things are incredibly liberal. And she is much more progressive than Joe Biden ever was. So, the fact that they put in Kamala Harris, kudos for putting in someone younger. The fact that you put in one of the most liberal politicians you probably could have put in it's going to be an issue,” Haley said.

Goldman Sachs says next US president to have limited tools to significantly boost 2025 oil supply,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/goldman-sachs-says-next-us-president-to-have-limited-tools-to-significantly-boost-2025-oil-supply-12778751.html,World,"July 26, 2024 07:40 AM","Goldman Sachs said on Thursday that whoever wins the U.S. presidential election in November will have limited tools to significantly boost domestic oil supply next year. Strategic petroleum reserve stocks are low and regulatory easing may only significantly boost U.S. long-run supply, the bank said in a client note. Oil prices rose slightly on Friday after the release of U.S. economic data that beat analyst estimates, raising investor expectation for increased crude oil demand from the world's largest energy consumer. The Brent crude futures contract for September traded around $82 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for September was around $78. Goldman Sachs expects Brent prices to range from $75 to $90 in 2025, assuming trend-like growth in gross domestic product (GDP) and steady oil demand as well as market balancing by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and affiliates. ""While there is a lot of uncertainty about trade policy, tariffs on U.S. crude imports seem unlikely."" Goldman Sachs expects oil prices to take a hit of as much as $11 per barrel next year as a result of weaker demand and GDP in a scenario where the U.S. imposes an across-the-board tariff of 10% on goods imports. However, tariffs could impact oil prices by as much as $19 if the Federal Reserve delays interest rate cuts beyond 2025 due to a higher core inflation rate, with Brent at $62 in the fourth quarter of 2025 compared to a current forecast of $81, the bank said.

Kamala Harris says she is ready to debate; Donald Trump says wait till Democratic convention,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/kamala-harris-says-she-is-ready-to-debate-donald-trump-says-wait-till-democratic-convention-12778738.html,World,"July 26, 2024 07:27 AM","Former US president and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Thursday refused to debate with his Democratic rival and Vice President Kamala Harris until the Democrats formally decide on their nominee, whereas the latter said that she is ready for a debate. “You have been asking me about the debate and I'll tell you I'm ready to debate Donald Trump. I have agreed to the previously agreed upon September 10 debate,” Harris told reporters at Joint Base Andrews on her return from Houston. “He (Trump) agreed to that previously. Now here he is backpedaling and I’m ready and I think the voters deserve to see the split screen that exists in this race on a debate stage. And so I'm ready to go,” Harris said. Trump was declared the Republican party nominee at its convention in Milwaukee this month, Harris is all set to be declared the party’s nominee at its convention in Chicago in August. “Given the continued political chaos surrounding Crooked Joe Biden and the Democrat Party, general election debate details cannot be finalized until Democrats formally decide on their nominee,” Trump Campaign Communications Director Steven Cheung said in a late night statement. “There is a strong sense by many in the Democrat Party - namely Barack Hussein Obama - that Kamala Harris is a Marxist fraud who cannot beat President Trump, and they are still holding out for someone “better.” Therefore, it would be inappropriate to schedule things with Harris because Democrats very well could still change their minds,” Cheung said. Trump and US President Joe Biden, who dropped out of the race over the weekend and was succeeded by Harris, had previously agreed to two debates on June 27 and September 10. Biden’s disastrous debate in Atlanta on June 27 ultimately led him to quit the race three weeks later. The September 10 debate was previously agreed to be hosted by ABC News. The June 27 debate was hosted by CNN. Trump had told reporters early this week that he had agreed to a debate with Biden but was ready to debate Harris. “But I want to debate with her and she'll be no different because they have the same policies. I would be willing to do more than one debate actually,” he said, adding that he was not thrilled with ABC. Meanwhile, Fox News Media has proposed a debate between Trump and Harris on September 17 in Pennsylvania. ""Now that Vice President Kamala Harris is the presumptive Democratic nominee, FOX News Media is amending our proposal for a debate this cycle. Given the race has changed, we’d like to request the opportunity to host a Presidential Debate between VP Harris and former President Trump,"" Fox News Media said in letters sent to each campaign. ""We propose to host the debate in the state of Pennsylvania on Tuesday, September 17, just as early voting is getting underway there and in other key battlegrounds.

Harris said she had a “frank and constructive” conversation with Netanyahu in which she affirmed Israel's right to defend itself but also expressed deep concern about the high death toll in Gaza over nine months of war and the “dire” humanitarian situation there. With all eyes on the likely Democratic nominee, Harris largely reiterated Biden's longstanding message that it's time find an endgame to the brutal war in Gaza, where more than 39,000 Palestinians have died. Yet she offered a more forceful tone about the urgency of the moment just one day after Netanyahu gave a fiery speech to Congress in which he defended the war, vowed “total victory” against Hamas and made relatively scant mention of cease-fire negotiations. “There has been hopeful movement in the talks to secure an agreement on this deal,” Harris told reporters shortly after meeting with Netanyahu. “And as I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done.” Netanyahu met separately earlier in the day with President Joe Biden, who has also been calling on Israel and Hamas to come to an agreement on a U.S.-backed, three-phase deal to bring home remaining hostages and establish an extended cease-fire. Harris said following her meeting with Netanyahu that Israel's war in Gaza is more complicated than simply about people being supportive of one side or the other. “Too often, the conversation is binary when the reality is anything but,” Harris said. Harris also condemned Hamas' brutality. White House national security council spokesman John Kirby reiterated the administration position that the militant group that killed some 1,200 on Oct. 7 and kidnapped 250 people from Israel ultimately holds responsibility for the suffering in Gaza and must come to terms with Israel. Kirby added that gaps between the two sides can be closed “but there are issues that need to be resolved that will require some leadership, some compromise."" With Harris' forceful comments, the administration also appeared to be stepping up pressure on the Israelis to not let the moment pass to get a deal done. “What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. The images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time,” Harris said. “We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering. And I will not be silent.” Thousands protested Netanyahu's visit in Washington, and Harris condemned those who were violent or used rhetoric that praised Hamas. Netanyahu, last at the White House when former President Donald Trump was in office, is headed to Florida on Friday to meet with the Republican presidential nominee. Ahead of the Harris-Netanyahu meeting on Thursday, Trump said at a rally in North Carolina the vice president was “totally against the Jewish people."" Harris has long spoken of her strong support for Israel. The first overseas trip of her Senate career in early 2017 was to Israel, and one of her first acts in office was to introduce a resolution opposing a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel. She's also spoken of her personal ties to Israel, including memories of raising money as a child to plant trees in Israel, installing a mezuzah near the front door of the vice president's residence in Washington (her husband is Jewish) and her connections to pro-Israel groups including the conservative American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the liberal J Street. For Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu was an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief. She's being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasn't done enough to force Netanyahu to end the war and by Republicans looking to brand her as insufficient in her support for Israel. Harris' last one-on-one engagement with Netanyahu was in March 2021, but she's taken part in more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu. The conservative Likud Party leader Netanyahu and centrist Democrat Biden have had ups-and-downs over the years. Netanyahu, in what will likely be his last White House meeting with Biden, reflected on the roughly 40 years they've known each other and thanked the president for his service. “From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,” Netanyahu told Biden. A U.S.-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases is something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for Biden, who abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. It could also be a boon for Harris in her bid to succeed him.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is on a visit to the USA. He will meet the former president and Republican candidate Donald Trump. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a combative speech to the US Congress on Wednesday, pledging “total victory” against Hamas and calling American opponents of the Gaza war “idiots.” This stance contrasted with the Biden administration’s hopes for progress in ending the fighting. Netanyahu highlighted the strong US-Israel relationship but also underscored domestic divisions, as dozens of Democratic lawmakers boycotted his address and thousands of protesters outside the Capitol condemned the war and its humanitarian impact. Protests near the Capitol turned chaotic, including an incident at Union Station where demonstrators spray-painted statues and replaced American flags with Palestinian ones. Police clashed with protesters on nearby streets, using batons and tear gas. Support for Israel holds significant political weight in the US, but Netanyahu's visit was overshadowed by US political turmoil, including an assassination attempt on Trump and Biden's decision not to seek another term.

Obama thinks that Harris cannot beat Republican candidate Donald Trump in the November election, according to a source close to the Biden family. A few days back, 81-year-old US President Joe Biden announced that he was withdrawing from the presidential race and endorsed Vice President Harris as the Democratic Party's nominee. While most of the Democratic leaders were quick to rally behind Harris, Obama, the 44th US President has held off so far. “Obama’s very upset because he knows she can’t win,” the Biden family source told The New York Post. “Obama knows she’s just incompetent — the border czar who never visited the border, saying that all migrants should have health insurance. She cannot navigate the landmines that are ahead of her.” Harris, 59, is the first woman, a Black person, and a person of South Asian descent to serve as Vice President. She joined the Biden ticket after a rocky and abbreviated run of her own for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

""My fellow Democrats, I have decided not to accept the nomination and to focus all my energies on my duties as President for the remainder of my term.

Gross domestic product increased at a 2.8% annualized rate last quarter, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said in its advance estimate of second-quarter GDP on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP rising at a 2.0% rate. Estimates ranged from a 1.1% rate to a 3.4% pace. The economy grew at a 1.4% rate in the first quarter. U.S. central bank officials regard a 1.8% pace as the non-inflationary growth rate. The economy, which continues to outperform its global peers despite hefty rate hikes from the Fed in 2022 and 2023, remains supported by a resilient labor market even as the unemployment rate has risen to a 2-1/2-year high of 4.1%. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, increased at a 2.9% rate after surging at a 3.7% pace in the first quarter, welcome news for U.S. central bank officials ahead of their two-day policy meeting next week. The so-called core PCE price index is one of the inflation measures tracked by the Fed for its 2% target. The Fed has maintained its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range for the past year. It has hiked its policy rate by 525 basis points since 2022. Financial markets expect three rate cuts this year, starting in September. Despite the solid economic growth pace, the outlook for the second half of the year is hazy. The labor market is slowing, which will impact wage gains. The saving rate is well below its pre-pandemic average and economists estimate that the bulk of the Fed's rate hikes is still to be felt. State and local government revenues are also slowing, which could erode spending. There are also worries about new tariffs, which could see businesses front-loading imports if former President Donald Trump is returned to the White House in November's presidential election. Nonetheless, a recession is not expected, with monetary policy easing anticipated this year.

'Expect Canada to ...': MEA condemns Khalistani separatist's video threatening Indian leaders,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/expect-canada-to-mea-condemns-khalistani-separatists-video-threatening-indian-leaders-12778395.html,World,"July 25, 2024 05:35 PM","The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), on Thursday, called on Canada to take action against individuals making threats against Indian leaders, in light of a recent video by Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun. During a weekly press briefing, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal condemned Pannun’s threats directed at Indian-origin leaders in Canada. He was referring to a recent video released by the Khalistani separatist, in which he threatened Indian-origin MP Chandra Arya and Indians living in Canada. Regarding reports that Canada has charged two individuals for online threats against PM Justin Trudeau and other leaders, Jaiswal remarked, ""We have noted these reports. When a democracy applies different standards to the rule of law and freedom of expression, it exposes its own double standards"". He stressed, ""We expect Canada to take action against anti-India elements who have targeted Indian leaders, institutions, airlines, and diplomats with violence. We urge Canada to apply similar measures to those threatening India"". Khalistani terrorist Pannun had released a video directing Indian-origin Canadian MP Chandra Arya and his followers to ""move back to India"" immediately. Pannun also announced that the Khalistan referendum will take place in Calgary, Canada, on July 28. Arya responded to the threats on X, stating, ""In response to my condemnation of the vandalism at BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Edmonton and other acts of hate and violence by Khalistan supporters, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun of Sikhs for Justice has released a video demanding that I and my Hindu-Canadian friends return to India"".

Russia-Ukraine war: Kremlin says Russia open to talks with Ukraine while Zelenskiy in power but...,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-war-kremlin-says-russia-open-to-talks-with-ukraine-while-zelenskiy-in-power-but-12778391.html,World,"July 25, 2024 04:33 PM","The Kremlin signalled on Thursday it was open to negotiations with Ukraine on ending the conflict while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy remains in power despite publicly doubting his legitimacy to rule. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Wednesday during a visit to China that Kyiv was prepared for talks with Russia provided Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity were fully respected, though he said that Ukraine has seen no sign of that. The Kremlin, while signalling its readiness for talks on its own terms, has publicly called into question Zelenskiy's mandate to rule, pointing out that his five-year term in office expired in May and that he should have called an election. Zelenskiy and the West say it is necessary to suspend normal political rules at a time of war and that the Kremlin, given Russia's own tightly-controlled political system, is in no position to criticise. When asked on Thursday whether Russia would be ready to hold talks with Ukraine while Zelenskiy was in power, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters: ""Russia is generally open to a negotiation process. But first we have to understand how ready the Ukrainian side is for this and how much the Ukrainian side has permission for this from its handlers."" Moscow depicts Zelenskiy as a U.S. puppet, a characterisation he rejects. ""Because so far you see very different statements being made, and it is not quite clear yet. Besides, in addition to the problem with Zelenskiy's legitimacy, there is also a problem with a (Ukrainian) legal ban on having any contacts and negotiations with the Russian side. Therefore, there is still a lot to be clarified and clarifications to be heard,"" said Peskov. Pressed during a conference call if the Kremlin could envisage negotiating with Zelenskiy or categorically ruled out such a possibility, Peskov said: ""The question is not an easy one. From a legal point of view this problem (of his legitimacy) is on the agenda, but from a practical point of view we are open to achieving our goals through negotiations. Therefore, different options are possible here."" Reuters reported in May that Putin was ready to halt the war in Ukraine with a negotiated ceasefire but the Kremlin chief was prepared to fight on if Kyiv and the West did not respond. Putin in June said Russia would end the war in Ukraine, something he calls a special military operation, only if Kyiv agreed to drop its NATO ambitions and hand over the entirety of four provinces claimed by Moscow, demands Kyiv swiftly rejected as tantamount to surrender.

Pilot miraculously survives Nepal crash after cockpit split from plane: Report,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/pilot-miraculously-survives-nepal-crash-after-cockpit-split-from-plane-report-12778244.html,World,"July 25, 2024 03:58 PM","Captain Manish Raj Shakya, the lone survivor of a deadly plane crash in Nepal that killed 18 other people on board, was saved after the cockpit of the aircraft was sheared off by a freight container seconds before the rest of the aircraft went up in flames, a media report said on Thursday. The Bombardier CRJ-200 aircraft of Saurya Airlines, carrying 19 people, including two crew members, technical staff of the airline and a child and his mother caught fire shortly after taking off from the Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) on Wednesday. The aircraft was bound for the Pokhara International Airport for regular maintenance service. Of the deceased, 15 died on the spot while three died during treatment at a local hospital, authorities said. Airport security personnel said when the plane hit the container, the front part of the cockpit got stuck in it, while the rest of the plane fell to the ground reaching another side of the ground. According to Deputy Inspector General and Chief of TIA Airport Security Office Ram Dutt Joshi, Captain Shakya, 37, was rescued from inside the container which was on the TIA premises. “We rescued Captain Shakya from inside the container,” The Rising Nepal newspaper quoted DIG Joshi as saying. Doctors have initiated an investigation into the brain scars of Shakya. Shakya is currently receiving treatment at Kathmandu Medical College (KMC). According to the doctors involved in treatment, although the injuries in different parts of the body and the broken bones at two places of the backbone have not caused serious problems, the doctors are investigating to find out the cause of the scars on Shakya’s brain. Neurosurgeon Dr Amit Thapa said that he could provide further information only after the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan of Shakya’s brain scars. Captain Shakya's health condition showed improvement on Thursday as compared to Wednesday. The doctors said he is “free from danger"" and can speak. He can also consume liquid food. According to KMC sources, Captain Shakya sustained several internal injuries despite not being burnt in the fire. The doctors are preparing for surgery to address his broken bones. In solemn tribute to the 18 lives lost, the Nepal government has decreed that the national flag will be flown at half-mast on Thursday. In response to the tragedy, a five-member probe commission has been formed to investigate the incident. The commission will be led by Ratish Chandra Lal Suman, former Director General of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN). The commission is tasked with delivering its report and recommendations within 45 days to prevent similar accidents in the future. Authorities are conducting an autopsy on the 18 people who lost their lives in the accident. The postmortem of the deceased began on Wednesday evening at the Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH). The postmortem of seven dead bodies has been completed. According to the TUTH, the dead bodies will be handed over to the families after the postmortem of all bodies is completed. However, there was a delay in the postmortem process due to excessive burns on the victims’ bodies. The TUTH said that it has been taking at least four hours to complete the postmortem of one body, myrepublica.com reported. The TUTH administration has assigned 25 doctors for the postmortem. Meanwhile, family members and friends of the victims on Wednesday gathered at the TUTH and some of them alleged that the airlines and civil aviation authority permitted the flight despite knowing that the plane had technical problems. Dirga Bahadur Khadka, a grand-uncle of co-pilot Sushant Katwal, said: ""We suspect that the company put pressure on the pilots into flying the plane. ""Otherwise, no one would like to fly a plane with technical problems,” he told The Kathmandu Post newspaper. “A question also arises about the civil aviation authority, the aviation sector regulator,” he further said. “How could it allow planes with technical problems to fly?” Similarly, Gyanendra Khadgi, who lost his brother-in-law Purna Ratna Shahi, a technician of Saurya Airlines, echoed Khadka. “This is complete negligence on the part of civil aviation to allow the flight of a plane with a technical issue,” he told the Post. Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli on Wednesday directed the relevant authorities to take measures to prevent tragic incidents like plane crashes in the future. After visiting the crash site, Prime Minister Oli received a briefing at the rescue coordination centre of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. He emphasised that everyone must work to ensure such incidents do not recur. He urged the concerned authorities to determine the cause of the incident, whether it was due to human error or a technical failure. He described the incident as very tragic and unimaginable. According to Nepal’s civil aviation body, 914 people have died in air crashes in the country since the first disaster was recorded in August 1955.

China making inroads into key choke points in Indian Ocean: US lawmaker warns,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/china-making-inroads-into-key-choke-points-in-indian-ocean-us-lawmaker-warns-12778220.html,World,"July 25, 2024 02:58 PM","China is making inroads into key choke points across the Indian Ocean, hindering free maritime passage and posing a threat to the national security and economic interests of both the US and its allies in South Asia, a prominent American lawmaker has claimed. The Indian Ocean is a vital artery for global commerce, with an estimated 80 per cent of maritime oil trade and 40 per cent of worldwide trade passing through its waters, Congresswoman Young Kim observed during a Congressional hearing. Young, who is the chairperson of the Subcommittee on Indo-Pacific in the House Foreign Affairs Committee, also said on Tuesday, “We cannot forget the significance of Indo in the Indo-Pacific.” Explaining how the South Asian region faces a dynamic geopolitical landscape that presents challenges for the US policy objectives, she said, South Asia holds “immense significance” for the US foreign policy and national security interests. Young listed all the recent Chinese development projects in recent years -- Chinese ports in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, military installations in Djibouti and infrastructure investments in the Maldives and drew attention to how the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is making inroads into key choke points along the maritime routes and obstructing the right to freely navigate the Indian Ocean waters. “These threaten the US national security and economic interests and those of our friends and allies in the region,” Young said. The resource-rich South China Sea in the Indo-Pacific region is widely seen as a potential flashpoint for global conflict. China claims most of the South China Sea as its own, while The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have counterclaims over the maritime area. Though the US is not a claimant to the South China Sea, it says the waters are crucial to its national interest of guaranteeing free passage through seas worldwide. The US Navy regularly conducts freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea, saying the US is “defending every nation’s right to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows.” It was not the first time that the Subcommittee on Indo-Pacific was dealing with the topic. Last month it held a hearing on the Indo-Pacific budget and the CCP aggression in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. “The Indo-Pacific region’s economic, geographical, and military significance makes it an essential arena for US-China competition. During this time, we must choose to show up for our allies, or risk ceding our leadership to the CCP,” she had said last month. Recalling that hearing, Young further said, “We cannot forget the significance of Indo in the Indo-Pacific. The CCP has sparked border conflicts along the Line of (Actual) Control with India and its submarines and warships regularly sail in the Indian Ocean.” Pointing out that the CCP is a top trading partner for Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Afghanistan, all countries that surround “our strategic partner India,” Young said, “The PLA's presence is also intensifying both along the Indian border and in the Indian Ocean.” Aid and cooperation play a pivotal role not only in advancing US interests in South Asia but also in enhancing their prosperity and keeping the region free and open, Young said. “Without greater US support, our allies and friends could be forced to accept further trade and investment from the CCP.” Young said she is “particularly concerned” about the growing relationship between CCP and the Maldives, which she described as a “key US security partner in the Indian Ocean.” The Maldives, having received several large CCP investments including USD 200 million for the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, is USD 1.4 billion in debt to the CCP, she said, adding, “During the Maldives president's visit with Xi Jinping in January, the two countries signed an additional 20 bilateral agreements.” Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia Donald Lu said that the military relationship between the Maldives and the People's Republic of China is only now starting. “We have the opportunity to shape that relationship through competition if you're the Maldives,” he said.

Netanyahu accuses Iran of funding anti-Israel protests in Congress address,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/netanyahu-accuses-iran-of-funding-anti-israel-protests-in-congress-address-12778103.html,World,"July 25, 2024 01:25 PM","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in his fourth address to a Joint Session of the U.S. Congress on Wednesday condemned Iran for funding and supporting anti-Israel groups and protests. He criticised protesters outside the venue, labeling them 'Iran's useful idiots.' “For all we know, Iran is funding the anti-Israel protests that are going on right now outside this building—not that many, but they’re there—and throughout the city. Well, I have a message for these protesters: When the Tyrants of Tehran, who hang gays from cranes and murder women for not covering their hair, are praising, promoting and funding you, you have officially become Iran’s useful idiots,” Netanyahu said. “It’s amazing, absolutely amazing. Some of these protesters hold up signs proclaiming 'Gays for Gaza'. They might as well hold up signs saying 'Chickens for KFC'. These protesters chant 'From the river to the sea'. But many don’t have a clue what river and what sea they’re talking about. They not only get an F in geography, they get an F in history. They call Israel a colonialist state. Don’t they know that the Land of Israel is where Abraham, Isaac and Jacob prayed, where Isaiah and Jeremiah preached and where David and Solomon ruled?” he said. In his fourth address to the Joint Session of the Congress, the most by any foreign leader, Netanyahu alleged that in the Middle East, Iran is virtually behind all terrorism, turmoil, chaos and killing. “And that should come as no surprise. When he founded the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini pledged, “We will export our revolution to the entire world. We will export the Islamic revolution to the entire world.” Now, ask yourself, which country ultimately stands in the way of Iran’s maniacal plans to impose radical Islam on the world? And the answer is clear: It’s America, the guardian of Western civilization and the world’s greatest power. That’s why Iran sees America as its greatest enemy,” he said. Iran, he said, understands that to truly challenge America, it must first conquer the Middle East. And for this it uses its many proxies, including the Houthis, Hezbollah and Hamas. “Yet in the heart of the Middle East, standing in Iran’s way, is one proud pro-American democracy—my country, the State of Israel,” he said. Asserting that victory is in site, Netanyahu said the day after they defeat Hamas, a new Gaza can emerge. “My vision for that day is of a demilitarized and deradicalized Gaza. Israel does not seek to resettle Gaza. But for the foreseeable future, we must retain overriding security control there to prevent the resurgence of terror, to ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel,” he said. “Gaza should have a civilian administration run by Palestinians who do not seek to destroy Israel. That’s not too much to ask. It’s a fundamental thing that we have a right to demand and to receive. A new generation of Palestinians must no longer be taught to hate Jews but rather to live in peace with us. Those twin words, demilitarization and deradicalization, those two concepts were applied to Germany and Japan after World War II, and that led to decades of peace, prosperity and security,” he added.

Operating profit for the three months ended June was 4.3 trillion won ($3 billion), compared with the 4.2 trillion won median estimate compiled by Bloomberg. The profit was a record, at least since 2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue rose 11% from a year ago to 45 trillion won, the Seoul-based company said. Shares fell as much as 4.3% in Seoul amid a broad market slump. The world’s third-largest carmaker is focusing on hybrids as demand for battery-powered cars wanes. Tesla Inc.’s second-quarter deliveries fell for second straight quarter, while General Motors Co. walked back expectations for its goal of building 1 million EVs by the end of next year.

The Anglo-Dutch consumer group’s underlying operating margin was almost 20% in the first half, compared with around 18% expected by analysts. Volume growth also ramped up as some shoppers started buying more branded goods again as inflationary pressures eased. Shares of Unilever rose as much as 7% in early trading in London. The stock is up about 11% in the last 12 months. The Anglo-Dutch maker of Dove soap is in the middle of a shakeup which includes a potential spinoff or sale of its ice cream business and a cost-cutting initiative that will shed 7,500 jobs globally. Schumacher has also scaled back some of the company’s environmental and social goals, saying the previous targets were unrealistic. His turnaround plan aims to simplify the group and do fewer things better. Schumacher said volumes had risen for the last three quarters in a sign some shoppers are spending more or switching back to branded goods, including “power brands” like Hellmann’s mayonnaise and Knorr stock cubes. Sales growth in the first half, however, was tempered by falling prices in India and Indonesian shoppers boycotting western brands over the war in Gaza. Unilever expects an underlying operating margin of at least 18% for the full year, but warned of slower growth in the second half. It also reiterated guidance of organic sales growth between 3% and 5% for the year. Beauty, personal care and homecare continued to outperform nutrition, bolstering the argument for further restructuring of the group, including a potential disposal of the nutrition unit. Schumacher told Bloomberg Television he wants to further streamline the nutrition business which would focus on big condiment and cooking aid brands like Hellmann’s and Knorr.

"In fiery speech to Congress, Netanyahu vows ‘total victory’ in Gaza and denounces US protesters",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/in-fiery-speech-to-congress-netanyahu-vows-total-victory-in-gaza-and-denounces-us-protesters-12778042.html,World,"July 25, 2024 12:56 PM","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged in a scathing speech to Congress on Wednesday to achieve “total victory” against Hamas and denounced American opponents of the war in Gaza as “idiots,” taking a combative stance in a visit the Biden administration has hoped will yield progress in negotiations to end the fighting. Netanyahu used the high-profile address to a joint meeting of Congress to emphasize longstanding and close ties between the United States and Israel. But the speech put in sharp relief the divisions in American society stirred by the war, with dozens of Democratic lawmakers boycotting the address and thousands of protesters outside the Capitol condemning the war and the humanitarian crisis created by it. Some of the protests near the Capitol turned chaotic. That included one within a few hundred yards of the tightly guarded Capitol grounds, at Union Station, where protesters spray-painted marble statuary and replaced American flags with Palestinian ones. Officers on streets surrounding the Capitol brawled with demonstrators, swinging batons and spraying tear gas. Speaking for nearly an hour to frequent applause from U.S. lawmakers, as well as stony silence from many leading Democrats, Netanyahu said the U.S. has a shared interest in his country’s fight against Hamas and other Iran-backed armed groups. “America and Israel must stand together. When we stand together something really simple happens: We win, they lose,” said Netanyahu, who wore a yellow pin expressing solidarity with the Israeli hostages held by Hamas. But the Israeli leader soon pivoted to a darker tone as he derided those protesting the war on college campuses and elsewhere in the U.S., gesturing to demonstrations happening on the streets outside the Capitol. He called protesters “useful idiots” for Israel’s adversaries. Netanyahu — making his first trip abroad since the war started — made no direct mention of months of U.S.-led mediation for a cease-fire and hostage-release. His remarks did not appear to close the door on a deal but showed no sign he was eager for one. “Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas’s military capabilities and its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home,” he said. “That’s what total victory means. And we will settle for nothing less.” Hostages freed from Gaza and families of those still in captivity listened in the House chamber. At least five of them rose to display T-shirts with slogans demanding an end to the war and the freeing of remaining hostages. Security officers removed the five. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian American serving Congress, went a step further, holding a sign that said “WAR CRIMINAL” on one side and “GUILTY OF GENOCIDE” on the other. Tlaib is one of Netanyahu’s most strident critics in Congress and was censured for her comments last year against the Israel-Hamas war, which has killed more than 39,000 in Gaza. She has relatives in the West Bank and represents a Michigan district with many Palestinian Americans. Netanyahu steered away from discussing efforts by the United States and Arab allies to negotiate an end to the fighting and a release of surviving hostages seized by Hamas-led militants. He accused American protesters of the war of standing with the militants who he said killed babies. “These protesters that stand with them, they should be ashamed of themselves,” he said. Some 1,200 people in Israel were killed in the Oct. 7 attack that started the war. Netanyahu — who is frequently accused of wading into U.S. politics in favor of conservative and Republican causes — started his remarks with praise of President Joe Biden. But he turned to lavishing praise on former president and current presidential contender Donald Trump “for all he’s done for Israel.” Netanyahu is scheduled to meet with Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday, and with Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Friday. Kentucky Republican Rep. Andy Barr praised the prime minister’s speech as an exhortation to see Israeli and American interests as intertwined. “Why should members of Congress, why should the American people defend Israel in their moment of need? Because it is in the national security interest of the United States to defeat Hamas and other Iranian proxies,” Barr said. Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, said Netanyahu’s speech was made for Trump’s GOP. “We didn’t hear anything about meaningful progress towards a bilateral cease-fire in return for hostages. We didn’t hear anything about peace,” he said. The families of American hostages being held in Gaza said they were “profoundly disappointed” by Netanyahu’s speech. In a joint statement, the families said he “failed to commit to the hostage deal that is now on the table even though Israel’s senior defense and intelligence officials have called on him to do so.” Eight Americans are believed to be held by Hamas, including three who were killed. Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who boycotted the speech, called Netanyahu’s speech “the worst presentation of any foreign dignitary invited and honored with the privilege of addressing the Congress.” Delivering the speech during Israel’s evening prime time, Netanyahu also had an eye on the audience back home. Netanyahu, whose popularity has plummeted from its pre-war levels, aimed to portray himself as a statesman respected by Israel’s most important ally and welcomed in the corridors of Washington. That task is complicated by Americans’ increasingly divided views on Israel and the war. The appearance made Netanyahu the first foreign leader to address a joint meeting of Congress four times, surpassing Winston Churchill. House Speaker Mike Johnson gave Netanyahu a warm welcome. More than 60 Democrats and political independent Bernie Sanders boycotted Netanyahu’s speech. The most notable absence was right behind him: Harris, who serves as president of the Senate, said a long-scheduled trip kept her from attending. The next Democrat in line, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, declined to attend, so Sen. Ben Cardin, the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, served as “senator pro tempore” in place of her. Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, was also a no-show for Netanyahu’s speech, citing the need to campaign. Support for Israel has long carried political weight in U.S. politics. But Netanyahu’s visit has been somewhat overshadowed by U.S. political turmoil, including the assassination attempt against Trump and Biden’s decision not to seek another term. Many Democrats attended the address despite their criticism of Netanyahu, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who in a floor speech in March called for new elections in Israel. Schumer, of New York, said then that Netanyahu has “lost his way” and is an obstacle to peace in the region. The United States is Israel’s most important ally, arms supplier and source of military aid. The Biden administration had said it wants to see Netanyahu focus his visit on helping it complete a deal for a cease-fire and hostage-release. Growing numbers of Israelis accuse Netanyahu of prolonging the war in order to avoid a likely fall from power whenever the conflict ends. Netanyahu’s visit came under the shadow of arrest warrants sought against him by the International Criminal Court over alleged Israel war crimes against Palestinians. The United States does not recognize the ICC.

Trump, 78, made these remarks during his first election rally after Harris was named the presumptive Democratic nominee. Over the weekend, President Joe Biden, 81, announced that he was withdrawing from the race and endorsed Harris as his successor. Harris, 59, is now the presumptive Democratic nominee and will be officially announced as the party's presidential candidate at the Democratic National Convention in August. “For three and a half years, Lyin Kamala Harris has been the ultra-liberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe. She is a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country if she ever gets the chance to get into office. We're not going to let that happen,” Trump said on Wednesday as he unleashed a torrent of attacks against her. Trump, who has previously called Biden ""Sleepy Joe,"" gave Harris the nickname ""Lyin Kamala"". “I was supposed to be nice. They say something happened to me when I got shot. I became nice,"" Trump said, referring to his brief call for national unity after the July 13 assassination attempt on his life.   ""And when you're dealing with these people, they're very dangerous people. When you're dealing with them, you can't be too nice. You really can't be. So if you don't mind, I'm not going to be nice. Is that okay?” he asked his supporters amidst huge applause from the audience. Harris is the most liberal elected politician in American history, he said. ""She's an ultra-liberal politician. She's absolutely terrible. She's, more liberal than Bernie Sanders,” he said. “If she ever got in, she'd destroy this country so fast. She was the border czar, but she never went to the border,” he alleged. Trump continued linking Harris to Biden and his policies and argued that both worked to cover up the president's physical decline while in office. “She was appointed by this horrible president, this horrible guy...what they've done to our country is unthinkable,” he alleged. Trump told his cheering supporters that Harris lies. “If Kamala will lie to you so brazenly about Joe Biden's mental incapacity, then she will lie to you about anything. She can never, ever be trusted. She can't be trusted. Just like crooked Joe Biden, Kamala Harris is unfit to lead. She's unfit to lead. She'll destroy our country in a year. This country will be destroyed,” he said. A vote for Harris is a vote for four more years of dishonesty, incompetence, weakness and failure, Trump said.   Trump alleged everything Harris touches turns into a total disaster. He mentioned Harris as many as 45 times in his speech. “When Kamala Harris was sent to Europe to deter Russia from attacking Ukraine, how did that work out? Russia answered by launching the invasion just five days after she left. Putin laughed at her like she was nothing. She is nothing. She's so bad for us. Everything Kamala touches turns into a total disaster. She's destroyed San Francisco with the policies,” Trump said. “She'll destroy our country if she's elected. So we won't let her be elected. We can't let that happen. Unbelievably, despite all of the damage she's caused, radical, liberal Kamala Harris now wants a promotion to deliver four more years of chaos. We've had the worst four years,” he said. This November, the American people are going to tell her, no thanks, Kamala, he said. ""You've done a terrible job. You've been terrible at everything you've done. You're ultra-liberal. We don't want you here. We don't want you anywhere. Kamala, you're fired. Get out of here. You're fired,” Trump said.

Nestle cuts full year sales guidance as price rises ease off,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/international-results/nestle-cuts-full-year-sales-guidance-as-price-rises-ease-off-12777868.html,World,"July 25, 2024 11:21 AM","Nestle SA downgraded its sales outlook for the year, saying the impact of pricing had eased off faster than expected. Nestle now expects sales to grow at least 3%, lower than the roughly 4% it had previously targeted. The world’s biggest food company has struggled to win back market share after inflation pushed shoppers to cheaper brands. Revenue rose 2.1% in the first half, compared with the 2.5% expected by analysts, the Swiss maker of Maggi stock cubes said Thursday. Almost all of that growth came from higher pricing which sharply slowed in the second quarter. Nestle’s coffee business, boosted by the rising price of the commodity, was the highest contributor to organic growth, increasing in the mid-single digits. A cost-of-living crisis has taken its toll on consumers who’ve traded down to supermarket brands, and consumer giants like Nestle have struggled to coax them back. Shares fell 11% over the last year. Faced with lower growth, Nestle could face pressure to cut costs more aggressively and consider whether acquisitions or disposals are needed to drive profitability. Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider has turned to innovation — including a range devised for people taking GLP-1 weight-loss drugs — to convince investors that the company has room left to grow. Nestle will launch new products addressing consumer trends this year, he said Thursday.

The balloons are part of an ongoing propaganda campaign by Pyongyang against North Korean defectors and activists in the South, who regularly send balloons carrying items such as anti-Pyongyang leaflets medicine, money and USB sticks loaded with K-pop videos and dramas. A suspected balloon suspended take-offs and landings at Seoul's Gimpo Airport on Wednesday evening for two hours, an official at the Korea Airports Corporation said. Balloons have affected traffic at South Korea's main international airport, Incheon, several times in recent weeks. In Gyeonggi, a province near Seoul, a balloon caught fire on top of a residential building. Fire fighters extinguished the blaze, an official at the Gyeonggi Northern Fire and Disaster Headquarters said. South Korea's military said some trash balloons were equipped with timed poppers that could cause fires.

Shortly before his speech, Republican Donald Trump laid into Democratic rival Kamala Harris in his first rally since she replaced Biden atop the ticket, signaling a bare-knuckled campaign ahead of the Nov. 5 election. Trump branded Harris a ""radical left lunatic"" after she had dominated the campaign the two previous days with withering attacks on Trump that pointedly raised his felony convictions, his liability for sexual abuse, and fraud judgments against his business, charitable foundation and private university. Biden said he believed he deserved to be reelected based on his record during his first term, but his love of country led him to step aside. ""I decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That is the best way to unite our nation,"" Biden said, after previously resisting calls from within the party that he quit the race following his poor showing in a June 27 debate with Trump. Biden, at 81 the oldest president in U.S. history, was greeted by cheers, applause and music in the Rose Garden after the address, as his staff had converged on the White House for a viewing party. Trump was less kind, saying in a post on his Truth Social platform that Biden's speech was ""barely understandable and sooo bad!"" After spending much of the campaign attacking Biden as old and feeble, Trump, 78, now faces a younger candidate in Harris, 59, the first Black woman and Asian American to serve as vice president. Energizing many Democrats as potentially the first woman to take the White House, Harris quickly consolidated the party behind her, as her campaign said it had raised $126 million since Sunday, with 64% of donors making their first contribution of the 2024 campaign. With nobody stepping up to challenge her for the nomination, she won the backing of party delegates on Monday, a day after Biden's announcement. The next highly anticipated development will be Harris' choice of a vice presidential candidate to counter Trump's selection of Ohio Senator J.D. Vance. Among the names being mentioned are Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. The Democratic National Committee's rules committee agreed on Wednesday on a plan to formally nominate Harris as soon as Aug. 1 - before the party's Aug. 19-22 convention in Chicago - with Harris picking a running mate by Aug. 7. Biden praised Harris as a strong leader who would make an effective president. ""She's experienced, she's tough, she's capable. She's been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country. Now the choice is up to you the American people,"" he said. Trump tried to quash some of her momentum in an aggressive speech at a campaign rally. ""I'm not gonna be nice!"" he told his cheering supporters in Charlotte, North Carolina, a battleground state where voting preferences can swing to either side. Harris on Tuesday showed her willingness to throw a punch, contrasting her background as a prosecutor to his record as a convicted felon. ""Do we want to live in a country of freedom, compassion and rule of law, or a country of chaos, fear and hate?,"" she asked during the speech in Milwaukee. A Reuters/Ipsos poll completed on Tuesday showed Harris with a two-percentage-point lead over Trump, 44% to 42%. A CNN poll conducted by SSRS showed Trump leading Harris, 49% to 46%. Both findings were within the polls' margins of error.

China unexpectedly cuts one-year policy rate by most since 2020,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/china-unexpectedly-cuts-one-year-policy-rate-by-most-since-2020-12777645.html,World,"July 25, 2024 07:57 AM","The People’s Bank of China unexpectedly lowered the rate on its one-year policy loans by the most since April 2020, following a surprise reduction to a key short-term rate to boost slowing economic activity. The central bank lowered the rate of medium-term lending facility by 20 basis points to 2.3%, according to a statement Thursday. The rate was last lowered in August 2023 and the cut followed the PBOC’s trim of the seven-day reserve repo rate by 10 basis points on Monday. The monetary authority has recently downplayed the MLF rate in favor of the short-term rate to guide markets in a way more similar to global peers. “It is basically a coordinated effort across all the key interest rates to ease monetary policy,” said Lynn Song, Greater China chief economist at ING Bank. “It’s worth highlighting this round of easing kicked off with the 7-day RR, which may be a signal of its future role as the main policy rate.” The announcement was unexpected because the PBOC typically conducts MLF in the middle of each month. The PBOC provided 200 billion yuan of MLF on Thursday, after it drained a net 3 billion yuan of cash via the funds earlier this month. China’s economic growth came in worse than expected in the second quarter, as faltering consumer spending more than offset an export boom.

More than two-thirds of respondents voted “yes.” The Tesla chief executive officer posed the question Tuesday, shortly after the carmaker reported a fourth straight quarter of disappointing profit. Musk was asked during the earnings call if the company would invest in xAI or integrate its chat bot, called Grok, into Tesla’s software. “Tesla is learning quite a bit from xAI,” he said, adding that it had helped advance Full Self-Driving, a suite of driver-assistance features. Musk said he supported the idea of Tesla investing in xAI, if shareholders approved it. Musk set up xAI in early 2023, months after OpenAI ushered in the AI boom with the launch of ChatGPT. The billionaire co-founded OpenAI as a nonprofit and was its leading funder before resigning from the board in 2018, citing a potential future conflict of interest with his role at Tesla. Concern about conflicts have resurfaced as Musk has built out his latest startup. In April, he said Tesla was having to make special efforts to retain AI specialists, and that some had left the carmaker for xAI. And in June, Musk confirmed he diverted scarce AI chips from Tesla to X Corp. and xAI. In the midst of those developments, xAI announced it had raised $6 billion in a funding round that valued the startup at around $18 billion. Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz were among the firms to take part in one of the biggest investments so far in generative AI. Musk has asked Tesla investors to sign off on controversial deals before. Shareholders approved the carmaker acquiring SolarCity — the debt-laden solar-panel installer run by two of his cousins — in 2016. The Tesla CEO expressed regret over the more than $2 billion bailout of SolarCity during a deposition taken over whether he improperly forced fellow directors to accept an overpriced deal. While Musk defeated those claims in 2022, the judge who decided the case faulted the billionaire for failing to properly remove himself from the transaction.

Trump, 78, launched a scathing attack on his Democratic rival, as he took the stage for the first time to address an election rally after Harris became the presumptive nominee. Over the weekend, President Joe Biden, 81, announced that he was dropping out of the race and named Harris as his successor. Harris, 59, is now the presumptive Democratic nominee and she was officially announced as the party’s presidential candidate at its Democratic National Convention in August. “For three and a half years, Lyin’ Kamala Harris has been the ultra-liberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe. She is a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country if she ever gets the chance to get into office. We're not going to let that happen,” Trump said as he unleashed a torrent of attack against the vice president. “I was supposed to be nice. They say something happened to me when I got shot. I became nice. And when you're dealing with these people, they're very dangerous people. When you're dealing with them, you can't be too nice. You really can't be. So if you don't mind, I'm not going to be nice. Is that okay?” he asked his supporters amidst huge applause from the audience. “Kamala Harris is the most liberal elected politician in American history. She's an ultra-liberal politician. She's absolutely terrible. She's, more liberal than Bernie Sanders,” he said. “If she ever got in, she'd destroy this country so fast. She was the border czar, but she never went to the border,” he alleged. “She was appointed by this horrible president, this horrible guy. How this guy got to be president in his basement. He stayed in his basement. And we did a lot better the second time than we did the first. How this guy got to be president, what they've done to this country in three and a half years, and we're going to turn it around. But what they've done to our country is unthinkable,” he alleged. Trump told his cheering supporters that Harris' lies. “If Kamala will lie to you so brazenly about Joe Biden's mental incapacity, then she will lie to you about anything. She can never, ever be trusted. She can't be trusted. Just like crooked Joe Biden, Kamala Harris is unfit to lead. She's unfit to lead. She'll destroy our country in a year.

Despite this windfall, taxes on the rich had plummeted to ""historic lows"", the NGO added, warning of ""obscene levels"" of inequality with the rest of the world ""left to scrap for crumbs"". Brazil has made international cooperation on taxing the super-rich a priority of its presidency of the G20, a group of countries representing 80 percent of the world's GDP. At this week's summit in Rio de Janeiro, the group's finance ministers are expected to make progress on ways to raise levies on the ultra-wealthy and prevent billionaires from dodging tax systems. The initiative involves determining methodologies to tax billionaires and other high-income earners. The proposal is due to be fiercely debated at the summit on Thursday and Friday, with France, Spain, South Africa, Colombia and the African Union in favour, but the United States firmly against. Oxfam dubbed it a ""real litmus test for G20 governments"", urging them to implement an annual net wealth tax of at least eight percent on the ""extreme wealth"" of the super-rich. ""Momentum to increase taxes on the super-rich is undeniable,"" said Oxfam International's head of inequality policy, Max Lawson. ""Do they have the political will to strike a global standard that puts the needs of the many before the greed of an elite few?"" Oxfam said that the $42 trillion figure was nearly 36 times more than the wealth accumulated by the poorer half of the world's population. Despite this, billionaires ""have been paying a tax rate equivalent to less than 0.5 percent of their wealth"" across the globe, the NGO said. Nearly four out of five of the world's billionaires call a G20 nation home, Oxfam noted.

Biden's announcement to not seek re-election on Sunday followed a disastrous June debate with Trump that exacerbated questions about his ability to win, or to serve another four years if he succeeded. In his address to the nation from the Oval Office, he said he believed he earned reelection because of his record during his first term. ""But nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition,"" he said. ""So I decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That is the best way to unite our nation.” Harris, the first Black woman and Asian American to serve as vice president, would become the first woman elected president if she prevails on Nov. 5. In the three days since Biden's decision, Harris has pulled in broad support across the Democratic Party and revitalized its election campaign. Biden praised Harris as a strong leader who would make an effective president. ""She's experienced, she's tough, she's capable. She's been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country. Now the choice is up to you the American people."" Hours earlier, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump tried to quash some of that momentum in an aggressive speech at the rally, his first since Harris' emergence changed the race. ""She is a radical Left lunatic who will destroy our country if she ever gets elected,"" he said. Trump routinely uses insults in attacking his opponents and made clear he planned to ignore advice that he take a softer line. ""I'm not gonna be nice!"" he told his cheering supporters in Charlotte. He attacked Harris as a driving force in the Biden administration who should be held responsible for its policies on immigration and other issues. ""As border czar, Kamala threw open our borders that allowed 20 million illegal aliens to stampede into our country from all over the world,"" Trump said. ""I will terminate every single open border policy of the Biden Harris administration and we will seal the border and we will stop Kamala Harris invasion without delay,"" the former president said. Biden put Harris in charge of working with countries in Central America to help stem the tide of migration, but she was not given responsibility for border security nor was she named ""border czar."" Trump also touched on abortion, an issue that Democrats had long seen abortion rights as a winning issue for them. ""When you compare my position on abortion to that of Kamala Harris, my position is eight points higher in the polls. And that's because she is so radical,"" he said. Harris has served as point person for the Biden administration on the issue of abortion, which is expected to become even more central to the campaign with her at the top of the ticket. 'PASS THE TORCH'Biden said he intends to focus on his work as president in the six months left in his term.""T hat means I will continue to lower costs for hard-working families and grow our economy. I will keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights – from the right to vote – to the right to choose,” he said, according to his prepared remarks, outlining some themes that Harris is expected to build her campaign around. The president returned to Washington on Tuesday afternoon after isolating with COVID at his home in Delaware, where he made the announcement that he was ending his campaign. The Democratic National Committee's rules committee agreed on Wednesday on a plan to formally nominate Harris as soon as Aug. 1 - before the party's Aug. 19-22 convention in Chicago - with Harris picking a running mate by Aug. 7. Earlier on Wednesday, the 59-year-old vice president called on a rally of more than 6,000 Black women in Indianapolis to help her revitalize the Democratic campaign. Harris spoke at an event in Indianapolis hosted by the Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, which was founded at Howard University, the historically Black college she attended. She hopes to tap sororities' multi-generational network of Black women - who played an important role in Biden's 2020 victory - to deliver strong voter turnout for Democrats again in November. ""I thank you. And now, in this moment, our nation needs your leadership once again,"" Harris said. Trump, coming off a triumphant week in which his party unified around his presidential bid after a failed assassination attempt two weekends ago, has had to watch as Biden's sudden departure from the race shifted the narrative and sparked a surge of attention toward Harris at his expense. Harris and Trump are closely competitive, public opinion polls showed this week. A Reuters/Ipsos poll completed on Tuesday showed Harris with a marginal two-percentage-point lead over Trump, 44% to 42%. A CNN poll conducted by SSRS showed Trump leading Harris, 49% to 46%.

The company has focused on expanding its Watsonx platform that allows users to deploy chatbots or enhance code for AI programs, while also making its Granite family of AI models open-source to help popularize its AI services. Big Blue's shares rose about 3% in extended trading, set to add to their year-to-date gains of about 12% from a rally in stocks of AI-linked companies. Software revenue increased about 7% to $6.74 billion in the quarter. The 113-year-old company now expects the segment to grow at a high-single-digit percentage in 2024, compared to its prior forecast of slightly above the high end of mid-single digit percentage.

""The commercialization of Generative AI is accelerating, positioning diversified enterprise technology companies like IBM to capitalize on the growing demand for AI integration,"" said Tejas Dessai, a research analyst at Global X. Meanwhile, IBM lowered its expectations for annual consulting revenue, estimating growth in low-single-digit percentages compared to its prior forecast of 6%-8%. Consulting revenue fell about 1% to $5.18 billion in the second quarter, as clients cut back on discretionary spending and short-term consulting projects amid higher-for-longer interest rates and inflationary pressures.

US yield curve steepens as bond traders see Fed cuts looming,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/us-yield-curve-steepens-as-bond-traders-see-fed-cuts-looming-12777614.html,World,"July 25, 2024 06:36 AM","The US yield curve steepened sharply amid growing calls for the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates as soon as next week. Yields on policy-sensitive two-year Treasuries slid three basis points on Wednesday, while those on 10-year bonds were up by about the same amount. That pushed the differential between those yields to about 14 basis points, the smallest margin since October 2023. That’s an indication investors see the Fed potentially reducing rates faster and deeper than previously anticipated. Swaps traders still price in more than two quarter-point cuts this year, with the first move likely in September. But with the central bank scheduled to announce its next decision in a week, pressure is rising for lower borrowing costs. In a Bloomberg Opinion column, former New York Fed President William Dudley said policymakers should reduce rates at the July gathering. “The front end has been rallying on the idea the Fed will cut sooner and more than the market had previously been pricing,” said Zachary Griffiths, a senior fixed-income strategist at CreditSights.  Such moves show a revival of the yield curve’s steepening — a favored wager of investors who expected Donald Trump to win the presidential election in November. On Wednesday, the yield on 30-year Treasuries rose as much as 7 basis points to 4.55%, the highest level since July 5. That widened its differential against the five-year note’s yield to as much as 38.7 basis points. That marked the steepest level since May 2023. The steeper yield curve reflected a “combination of 100% market probability of a September cut, equity selloff, and repositioning of election news,” said George Catrambone, head of fixed income at DWS Americas. After the Fed’s July meeting, he said focus will turn to a flurry of data reports for evidence of material weakness that “may bring renewed questions about the soft landing and perhaps the Fed falling back behind the curve and missing the opportunity to cut rates in July.” Economic data on Wednesday showed manufacturing slipped back into contraction territory and sales of new US homes unexpectedly declined in the US. Hours later, a $70 billion sale of five-year notes came at a yield of 4.121%, above the 4.110% level at which the when-issued security traded just as auction bidding completed. That was seen as a mediocre result when compared to record-setting demand for Tuesday’s $69 billion sale of two-year securities. The moves in long-dated yields led the Treasury to accept no offers from dealers in a debt buyback operation on Wednesday.

""I revere this office,"" Biden said. ""But I love my country more."" Biden, 81, rebuffed weeks of pressure from Democrats to step aside after a disastrous debate performance on June 27, saying at one point that only the ""Lord Almighty"" could convince him to go. “I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That is the best way to unite our nation,"" Biden said. Biden made his decision after days of soul-searching and agonizing over internal polling that predicted he could lose against Republican Donald Trump in November and drag down fellow Democrats with him. ""The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule. The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America – lies in your hands,"" Biden will say, according to the speech excerpts. It will be Biden's first extended public remarks since he relented to pressure from fellow Democrats and announced on Sunday via social media that he had decided not to seek reelection on Nov. 5. Biden is the first incumbent president not to seek reelection since 1968 when Lyndon Johnson, under fire for his handling of the Vietnam War, abruptly pulled out of the campaign on March 31. Biden also joins James K. Polk, James Buchanan, Rutherford B. Hayes, Calvin Coolidge and Harry Truman as presidents who all decided not to stand for a second elected term. Biden faced calls to step aside after his rocky performance in the debate against Trump raised troubling questions about his mental acuity. Since he stepped aside, however, Democrats have rallied around him, paying tribute to his character and his record as president. A crowd of staff walked into the White House earlier in the evening to watch the speech together. An official said a reception and ""viewing party"" were being held across the White House' state floor for Biden's address. The White House has denied that Biden has any cognitive issues despite a recent increase in verbal slipups. Biden said he will focus on his job as president over his remaining six months in office. He is to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday on efforts to negotiate a Gaza ceasefire. It was the fourth time Biden used the formal setting of the Oval Office since taking office in 2021. His last Oval Office speech was on July 15 when he urged Americans to cool the political rhetoric after the attempted assassination of Trump. Biden's political career began when he was elected to the Senate in 1972 at age 29, becoming the sixth youngest U.S. senator. He will conclude his White House tenure on Jan. 20, 2025, as the oldest American president when he will have already turned 82. “The defense of democracy is more important than any title,"" Biden said. ""I draw strength, and find joy, in working for the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our Union is not about me. It’s about you. Your families. Your futures. It’s about ‘We the People.’”

US plans $100 million push to keep China out of Pakistan's backyard: Report,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/us-plans-100-million-push-to-keep-china-out-of-pakistans-backyard-12777348.html,World,"July 24, 2024 06:16 PM","US has proposed a budget of $101 for Pakistan as part of its effort to wean Islamabad away from all-weather ally China's influence. US assistant secretary of state Donald Lu told a congressional panel on Tuesday that the allocation will be used to strengthen democracy, fight terrorism, stabilise the country’s economy and prevent Pakistan's reliance of China in FY25. The explicit mention of China comes at a time when Pakistan is struggling with mounting foreign debt, most of which is owed to Beijing. According to a report in 2023, Pakistan owes one-third of its $125 billion debt to China alone. Dawn reported that the US budget document seeks a total of $1.01 billion in foreign assistance for the South and Central Asia region to “compete with the People’s Republic of China (PRC), counter Russian and Chinese disinformation, and prevent terrorist groups from threatening the US security”. Lu said that US wants to prevent Islamabad's ""further overreliance"" on Beijing. “China is the past in terms of investment; we are the future,” he added. The Biden administration official said that US has been struggling to compete with China in the region, with Beijing expanding its military and commercial foothold in the Indo-Pacific. A study in 2023 revealed that Pakistan is the third largest beneficiary of Chinese development finance worldwide with a staggering portfolio of $70.3 billion. The China Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC, is part of the China's flagship Belt & Road Initiative. However, several reports have indicated that multiple billion-dollar projects under CPEC have been hanging fire. Notably, in 2018, then US President Donald Trump had cancelled $1.3 billion in aid to Pakistan and denounced it for not doing enough to end terror emanating from its soil. Ties between the two countries had plunged further after Trump's decision.

"US Polls: 'A choice between freedom and chaos', Harris tells roaring Wisconsin voters",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/us-polls-a-choice-between-freedom-and-chaos-harris-tells-roaring-wisconsin-voters-12777272.html,World,"July 24, 2024 05:04 PM","A roaring crowd of battleground state voters greeted Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday as she opened her public case against Republican former President Donald Trump by declaring November's election will be ""a choice between freedom and chaos."" ""In this campaign, I promise you, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week,"" Harris said.""We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead."" Harris arrived in the Milwaukee area having locked up nomination support from Democratic delegates after President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid on Sunday. It was her first campaign rally since she jumped into the race just two days ago with Biden's endorsement. The event reflected a vibrancy that had been lacking among Democrats in recent weeks, and Harris was intent on projecting a sense of steady confidence about the November election. She's pulled in $100 million in donations since Sunday afternoon and on Tuesday picked up the backing of more Democratic officials and political groups, including congressional leaders Charles Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries. By stopping in Wisconsin, Harris was putting down a marker in one of the ""blue wall"" states along with Michigan and Pennsylvania that Democrats see as essential for securing a presidential victory. The visit comes a week after the Republican National Convention wrapped up in the city and as Harris works to sharpen her message against the GOP nominee with just over 100 days until Election Day. Harris' trip to the state was a sharp contrast to Biden's July 6 visit, when he was trying to reassure Democrats who were wary after his troubling performance in the June 27 debate against Trump. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is up for reelection this year, had skipped the Biden event, but she spoke before Harris on Tuesday. Harris is leaning into her resume as a former district attorney and California attorney general, seeking to draw a contrast with Trump who is the first former president to be convicted of felony crimes. ""She's prepared to meet this moment because she was professionally trained to prosecute a criminal, and unfortunately that's who the Republicans have put forward,"" said Senator Laphonza Butler of California Harris strode onto the stage Tuesday to the anthem ""Freedom"" from Beyonce's ""Lemonade"" album and set about contrasting herself with Trump. 'I took on perpetrators of all kinds. Predators who abused women. Fraudsters who ripped off consumers. Cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump's type,"" she said. Harris cast her campaign as a ""people first"" endeavor, again aiming to draw a contrast with Trump, who she said represented special interests and corporations. She also portrayed her rival's policies as being antiquated and backward looking. ""We are not going back,"" she said. And I'll tell you why we are not going back. Ours is a fight for the future."" That echoed Barack Obama who frequently deployed the refrain during his 2012 reelection fight to argue against Republican ideas. Harris' swift ascent over the past few days has required her to vet possible running mates, a process being led by Eric Holder, who was attorney general during Barack Obama's presidency. But her key impact so far has been galvanizing Democrats. Before the Tuesday speech, Diane Walter, 68, of South Milwaukee said she was thrilled that Harris is the candidate. ""I've been a Democrat my whole life,"" Walter said. ""She's energizing the party again."" Tevin Humphrey, 21, came with his mother Myeesha Johnson, 41, and described the vice president as ""a great figure to look up to."" ""She's a better representative of the diversity we're looking for,"" he said. Trump and his campaign have quickly turned most of their focus on Harris and have asserted that they were prepared for the change and it did not alter their plans. The former president has nicknamed the vice president ""Lyin' Kamala Harris,"" accused her of not being tough enough on crime as a prosecutor and sought to bind her to the administration's policies on the border as he seeks to make immigration a focus of his campaign. But there are signs that Trump seems to be unhappy about facing the younger vice president rather than making his case against the aging president. Twice since Biden dropped out, Trump has said the planned second presidential debate should not be hosted by ABC News and suggested it be moved to Fox News, which has a perception of being friendlier to him. Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, at an appearance in Washington, said he was unimpressed by Trump's attacks, telling reporters Tuesday,""That's all he's got? In addition to Baldwin, Harris was joined by major elected officials in Wisconsin, including Gov. Tony Evers, Attorney General Josh Kaul, Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski and Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler. Republican leaders in Wisconsin, for their part, branded Harris as an ""extreme liberal' who is out of step with most voters in the swing state. ""Kamala Harris' favorables are as bad as Joe Biden's,"" said Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Brian Schimming at a news conference ahead of the Harris event at a high school outside of Milwaukee. ""So they are exchanging one bad candidate for another bad candidate in the hope that the people of this state and this country don't notice where she actually stands on the issues.""

According to a report in The Kathmandu Post, Nepal has finally said ""no, thanks"" to China and is using its own money to upgrade the crucial highway. In 2015, Chinese President Xi Jinping had promised then-Nepal President Ram Baran Yadav that Beijing will provide over 900 million RMB ($123 million) during their meeting in Hainan. The Chinese assistance would have helped upgrade the 115-km highway that connects Nepal with China. According to the report, a major chunk of the Araniko Highway was built by the Chinese government in the 1960s. However, several sections of the highway were damaged by the April 2015 earthquakes. Nepalese lawmaker Madhav Sapkota told The Kathmandu Post that China did not release the funds despite multiple reminders. “This particular Chinese aid was renewed every year by the International Economic Cooperation Coordination Division of the Ministry of Finance, but despite numerous calls, requests and meetings, we haven’t received the fund,” he said. He added that Nepal is allocating Rs 3.6 billion from its own budget to carry out maintenance work along a 26-km stretch of the highway and manage landslides based on a detailed project report prepared by the Department of Road. Sapkota mentioned that he has dedicated much of his parliamentary career to advocating for the full reopening of the Tatopani border and facilitating cross-border movement of goods and people. “Recently, China seems to have recognized that the Tatopani border point is more advantageous for trade than Keyrung,” he said. “The true potential of the Tatopani border will be realized once the highway leading up to it is repaired to prevent occasional flooding and landslides.” He also noted that post-Covid automation by four large Chinese companies operating in Nepal, along with the use of loaders and machinery, has led to significant job losses for Nepalis.

Over the past week, migrants have launched two caravans - large groups of people walking together - bound for the United States. In the past, such caravans have stirred intense debate in the United States, where immigration is likely to be a key topic ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election. ""Whoever is (in charge of the U.S. government), we will continue the fight to be there,"" said Leivi Galvna, a migrant from Honduras. ""We have to fight for our dream."" As they walked, the group shouted phrases like ""yes we can,"" while pushing worn-out strollers. In recent years, caravans have been a means for tens of thousands of migrants to cross Mexico, often as a safety measure amid reports that robberies, rapes and kidnappings of migrants are common. The caravans are often a lifeline for those who cannot afford to pay a smuggler or human trafficker for a ""safer"" journey. ""I travel more safely in a caravan, I don't want to be killed in Mexico,"" said Yoisy, a Venezuelan migrant who tired of waiting for an appointment through the U.S. Customs and Border Protection CBP One platform to apply for asylum. The Security Ministry in Chiapas, Mexico's southernmost state, bordering Guatemala, told Reuters there were between 2,500 and 3,000 people in the caravan and most were Venezuelans. Another local government source said there had been a significant increase in the number of children in recent caravans. In June, when the Biden administration early in the month implemented a policy prohibiting migrants caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally from applying for asylum, the daily average of arrests ranged between 2,500 and 3,000 migrants per day for a week, a huge decline from prior months. But thousands of migrants continue to take a shot at seeking asylum in the United States with the hope of leaving behind insecurity, poverty and other problems in their home countries. Jose Maria Garcia, director of the Juventud 2000 migrant shelter in Tijuana, said he did not know to which border town the caravans were headed, but said the uncertain outcome of the upcoming US elections could be a motivating catalyst. ""The migrant community is very confused,"" he said, of how migrants view the future of U.S. immigration policy.

BYD's strong growth in Singapore, one of the region's smallest auto markets, underscores the Chinese firm's ambition to dominate the Southeast Asia market, where gasoline car brands from Japan and South Korea are popular and Tesla has yet to establish a big presence. The Chinese firm has had already had early success in the region, claiming Thailand as its biggest overseas market as it expands distribution partnerships with local conglomerates. Tesla on Tuesday reported its lowest profit margin in more than five years and missed Wall Street earnings targets in the second quarter, hurt by mounting price competition from rivals amid a sharp slowdown in global EV demand. By contrast, BYD posted a 21% rise in second-quarter sales and continues its aggressive expansion outside of China, including opening its first stores in Vietnam this week, where Tesla has yet to start vehicle sales. BYD has also ramped up its marketing efforts in Singapore, a small, wealthy island with a population of 5.9 million and where vehicle taxes are among the highest in the world. It opened two restaurants where consumers can dine on dishes inspired by its car models and book a test drive. BYD's EV sales in Singapore jumped 83% in the first half of this year from the entire 2023 level to 2,587 units, while second-ranked Tesla sold just 28 more cars during the period than last year, putting 969 Teslas on the roads. There is little price difference between BYD and Tesla in Singapore, where car owners must buy a certificate that costs about S$100,000 ($74,000). Singapore wants to stop the purchase of combustion-engine cars from 2030. EV sales in the city state accounted for around one third of total vehicle sales in the first half of this year. In broader Southeast Asia market, Tesla saw its market share fall to 4% in the first quarter of this year from 6% a year earlier, even as the overall EV market grew by 37% during the same period, according to the latest data from research firm Counterpoint.

The US company is trying to piece together the series of events that led to one of the most spectacular rolling IT failures the world has ever seen. The incident crashed Microsoft Windows computer systems around the world on Friday, taking down airline, banking and stock exchange operations from Australia and Japan to the UK. Read More: How Routine CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s Computers Microsoft and CrowdStrike rolled out fixes last week, and many systems have been restored. But for several hours, bankers in Hong Kong, doctors in the UK and emergency responders in New Hampshire found themselves locked out of programs critical to keeping their operations afloat. More than 8.5 million Windows users were affected, according to Microsoft. In the report, the company said it regularly makes what are known as security content configuration updates, intended to help the company observe, detect or prevent malicious activity, depending on the customer’s policy configuration. A “problematic Rapid Response Content configuration update” carried an undetected error and crashed Windows systems, the company said in a preliminary post-incident review, published about five days after the incident. CrowdStrike said it would improve testing of Rapid Response Content in future, in a variety of ways. It said a new check “is in process” in order to fix the faulty Content Validator that failed to vet the problematic content. CrowdStrike also plans to stagger future deployments of updates so they are tested piecemeal - known as a canary deployment - before rolling it out at large. Finally, the company said it would allow customers greater control over the delivery of such content, so they can select when and where updates are deployed. CrowdStrike’s shares dropped nearly 30% in the aftermath of the outage, slashing billions of dollars from its market value. The US House Committee on Homeland Security requested Chief Executive Officer George Kurtz’s appearance and lawmakers called on him to explain how the company will mitigate risks of a similar incident in the future. Shawn Henry, CrowdStrike’s chief security officer, apologized in a post on LinkedIn on Monday, saying that the company had “failed” its customers. “The confidence we built in drips over the years was lost in buckets within hours, and it was a gut punch,” he said.

Can Kamala Harris win the US presidency after Joe Biden's withdrawal? Here's what the polls say,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/can-kamala-harris-win-the-us-presidency-after-joe-bidens-withdrawal-heres-what-the-polls-say-12776980.html,World,"July 24, 2024 01:28 PM","The United States election will be held on November 5. On Sunday US time, President Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential election contest and endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris. It's not certain, but very likely Harris will now be the Democratic candidate to face former Republican president Donald Trump in November. During the Democratic presidential primaries held early this year, Biden won about 95% of all delegates to the August 19-22 Democratic convention. These delegates are likely to support Harris given Biden's endorsement. Since the debate with Trump on June 27 was widely thought to have been a disaster for Biden, he has faced pressure to withdraw. In an Ipsos poll for US ABC News that was released before Biden's withdrawal on Sunday, Democratic voters wanted Biden to withdraw. Following the assassination attempt against Trump on July 13 and the Republican convention from July 15-18, Trump's lead over Biden in the FiveThirtyEight aggregate of national polls had increased to 3.2 points from 1.9 points on July 13, the largest margin since the aggregate began in March. Vote shares were 43.5% for Trump, 40.2% for Biden and 8.7% for Robert F Kennedy Jr. I've written previously that the presidency is not decided by the national popular vote. Instead, each state has a certain amount of Electoral Votes (EVs), mostly based on population, with each state awarding their EVs winner takes all. It takes 270 EVs to win. The EV system is likely to skew to Trump, so Biden was further behind than in the national polls. Biden will continue as president until his term ends in January 2025. His net approval in the FiveThirtyEight aggregate is -17.7, with 56.2% disapproving and 38.5% approving. His net approval is worse than other previous presidents at this point in their term, except George Bush Sr and Jimmy Carter. Trump's net favourability in the FiveThirtyEight aggregate is -12.0, with 53.7% unfavourable and 41.7% favourable. His ratings have been relatively unchanged since April. Unfortunately, FiveThirtyEight has no favourability ratings for Harris. Will Harris win? It's too soon to analyse Harris vs Trump polls. Harris had not been a presidential candidate before today and name recognition of Biden explains his often better numbers than Harris. A recent national YouGov poll for CBS News gave Trump a five-point lead over Biden and a three-point lead over Harris. There are two things that should advantage Harris. One is that economic data has improved, with inflation dropping and real earnings up. The other is that, while Biden would have been almost 82 by the election, Harris will only be 60 by then. Trump is 78, so the age split that was unfavourable to Biden will be favourable to Harris. Nevertheless, nominating a candidate who has not been battle-tested in the primaries is very risky. When Harris ran for president in 2020, she withdrew from the contest in December 2019, before any primaries. However, with Biden's age of great concern to voters, and with him already behind Trump, switching to a new candidate could prove a sensible move for the Democrats. Changes in prime minister have worked for Australian parties in the past, with Malcolm Turnbull winning the 2016 federal election after replacing Tony Abbott, and Scott Morrison winning in 2019 after replacing Turnbull. While Biden has been losing, US Senate polls in the presidential swing states of Pennsylvania, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan and Arizona suggest the Democratic candidates are winning, and doing much better than Biden. So perhaps Democrats just have a Biden problem. US earnings up In June, headline inflation dropped 0.1% after being unchanged in May and 12-month inflation dropped to 3.0%, the lowest it has been since June 2023. Core inflation was up 0.1% in June after increasing 0.2% in May and has increased 3.3% in the last 12 months, the smallest increase since April 2021. The low inflation in May and June has boosted real (inflation-adjusted) earnings in those months, with real hourly earnings up 0.9% for May and June and real weekly earnings up 0.7%. In the 12 months to June, real hourly earnings are up 0.8% and real weekly earnings up 0.6%. In June, a net 206,000 jobs were added, but the unemployment rate increased 0.1% to 4.1%. This is the highest unemployment rate since November 2021. (The Conversation/PTI)

""Starlink is now active in a Gaza hospital with the support of @UAEmediaoffice andÂ @Israel,"" Musk posted on X. The announcement came more than five months after the Israeli government gave approval for Starlink's use in the hospital in Rafah, a flashpoint city in southern Gaza.

The high speed internet would enable potentially life-saving medical consultations via real-time video calling, the UAE foreign ministry said in February. The UAE, a major oil producer and regional finance and tourism hub, signed a normalisation deal with Israel in 2020 along with Bahrain and Morocco. Sudan later sealed a normalisation agreement with Israel. The pacts were designed to bring stability and prosperity to the turbulent Middle East. Hamas started the war in Gaza on Oct. 7 when it attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking over 250 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.

US Polls: Donald Trump takes fight against Kamala Harris to North Carolina rally,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/us-polls-donald-trump-takes-fight-against-kamala-harris-to-north-carolina-rally-12776922.html,World,"July 24, 2024 12:49 PM","Donald Trump has so far watched from the sidelines as Vice President Kamala Harris galvanized and re-energized Democrats by stepping in as their likely presidential nominee. On Wednesday, Trump gets back in the game. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, will hold his first campaign rally since Harris emerged as his near-certain Democratic foe in the 2024 election. The former president will appear at an event in Charlotte, North Carolina, a state that will be an important battleground in the Nov. 5 election. The Trump campaign has insisted that it is prepared for Harris' candidacy, arguing that she serves as a proxy for President Joe Biden on the economic and immigration policies that contributed to his sinking popularity with voters. A Reuters-Ipsos poll released on Tuesday showed the newly re-jiggered race to be in a statistical dead heat. The poll, taken in the two days since Biden decided to stand down from reelection, showed Harris with a two-percentage-point lead over Trump, 44% to 42%. Other recent national polls have shown Trump with an advantage. Biden, who came back to Washington after isolating at his home in Delaware with COVID, will address the nation from the Oval Office on Wednesday night to explain his reasons for dropping out of the race on Sunday after intense pressure from his party. A person familiar with the matter said the legacy-defining speech was still being crafted on Tuesday night when Biden returned to the White House after his convalescence in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, where he ended his reelection bid with a letter posted to social media. On Tuesday, Trump took the unusual step of speaking to reporters on a conference call to underscore his campaign's line of attack on the border, saying Harris was partially responsible for a record flow of migrants. Biden put Harris in charge of working with countries in Central America to help stem the tide of migration, but she was not made responsible for border security. ""She's a radical left person, and this country doesn't want a radical left person to destroy it,"" Trump said on the call. ""She wants open borders. She wants things that nobody wants."" Harris has not called for the removal of border controls. HARRIS ADDRESSES BLACK SORORITY Harris on Wednesday will head to Indianapolis to speak at an event hosted by the Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, which was founded at Howard University, the historically Black college that Harris attended. She hopes to tap sororities' multi-generational network of Black women to deliver strong voter turnout for Democrats in November. Harris held an energetic first rally as the likely nominee on Tuesday in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which hosted the Republican National Convention last week. She assailed Trump and said he would take the nation ""backward."" ""Do we want to live in a country of freedom, compassion and rule of law, or a country of chaos, fear and hate?"" she asked the crowd. Harris ticked through a list of liberal priorities, saying that if elected she would act to expand abortion access, make it easier for workers to join unions and address gun violence, drawing a sharp contrast with Trump. Democrats will formally nominate their new ticket at next month's convention in Chicago after an Aug. 7 virtual vote. Roy Cooper, North Carolina's Democratic governor, is considered to be on the short list to serve as Harris' running mate. Harris and her campaign have worked at a breakneck pace to consolidate support among Democrats in Congress and delegates across the country. Candidates who could have been potential rivals for the nomination have fallen in line and endorsed her. Trump, coming off a triumphant week in which his party unified around his presidential bid after a failed assassination attempt two weekends ago, has had to watch as Biden's sudden departure from the race dramatically shifted the narrative and sparked a surge of attention toward Harris at his expense. The Harris campaign said it has raised over $100 million since Sunday.

Secret Service director steps down after assassination attempt against ex-President Donald Trump at rally,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/secret-service-director-steps-down-after-assassination-attempt-against-ex-president-donald-trump-at-rally-12776817.html,World,"July 24, 2024 11:49 AM","The director of the Secret Service resigned Tuesday in the aftermath of the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump that unleashed an outcry about how the agency failed in its core mission to protect current and former presidents. Kimberly Cheatle, who had served as Secret Service director since August 2022, faced growing calls to resign and several investigations into how a gunman was able to get so close to the Republican presidential nominee at an outdoor campaign rally in Pennsylvania. “I take full responsibility for the security lapse,” she said in an email to staff obtained by The Associated Press. “In light of recent events, it is with a heavy heart that I have made the difficult decision to step down as your director.” Cheatle’s departure was unlikely to end the scrutiny of the long-troubled agency after the failures of July 13, and it comes at a critical juncture ahead of the Democratic National Convention and a busy presidential campaign season. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have promised more investigations. An inspector general probe and an independent, bipartisan effort launched at President Joe Biden’s behest will keep the agency in the spotlight. Cheatle’s resignation came a day after she appeared before a congressional committee and was berated for hours by both Democrats and Republicans for the security failures. She called the attempt on Trump’s life the Secret Service’s “most significant operational failure” in decades, but she angered lawmakers by failing to answer specific questions about the investigation. Biden said in a statement that “what happened that day can never happen again,” and he planned to appoint a new director soon, but he did not discuss a timeline. The president and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas thanked Cheatle for her service. Mayorkas appointed Deputy Director Ronald Rowe as acting director. He has worked for the agency for 23 years. “At this moment in time, we must remain focused,” Rowe said in a note to staff obtained by AP. “We will restore the faith and confidence of the American public and the people we are entrusted to protect.” Congressional questioningAt the hearing Monday, Cheatle remained defiant that she was the “right person” to lead the Secret Service, even as she said she took responsibility for the failures. When Republican Rep. Nancy Mace suggested Cheatle begin drafting her resignation letter from the hearing room, Cheatle responded, “No, thank you.” The 20-year-old shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, was able to get within 135 meters (157 yards) of the stage where the former president was speaking when he opened fire. That’s despite a threat on Trump’s life from Iran that led to additional security for the former president in the days before the rally. Cheatle acknowledged Monday that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the rally shooting. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks fired had been identified as a potential vulnerability days earlier. But she failed to answer many questions about what happened, including why there were no agents on the roof. A bloodied Trump was quickly escorted off the stage by Secret Service agents, and agency snipers killed the shooter. Trump said part of his right ear was pierced in the shooting. One rallygoer was killed, and two others were critically wounded. Details continue to emerge about signs of trouble that day and the roles of the Secret Service and local authorities. The agency routinely relies on local law enforcement to secure the perimeter of events. Former top Secret Service agents said the gunman should never have been allowed to gain access to the roof. After Cheatle’s resignation, Trump posted on his social media network: “The Biden/Harris Administration did not properly protect me, and I was forced to take a bullet for Democracy. IT WAS MY GREAT HONOR TO DO SO!” The House Homeland Security Committee had asked Cheatle to testify Tuesday for another hearing on the assassination attempt, but lawmakers said she refused. Cheatle’s name was on a card on a table in front of an empty chair during the hearing, which began shortly before her decision to step down became public. Investigating an ever-growing number of threatsThe Secret Service is a part of the Department of Homeland Security, which includes immigration, transportation security and the Coast Guard. The department was formed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. A few years ago, there was a movement to shift the agency back to the Treasury Department, where it was housed before Sept. 11, particularly because Homeland Security’s intense focus on immigration added to the growing divide between what the Secret Service sees as its dual missions — protecting the president and investigating financial crime — and the mission of its parent department. But that movement stalled. Roughly half of the Secret Service’s $3 billion budget is spent on protective services. It also has a robust cybercrime division, state-of-the-art forensic labs and a threat-assessment center that studies how to mitigate and train against threats. With a workforce of 7,800 special agents, uniformed officers and other staff, the Secret Service has investigated an ever-increasing number of threats against the president and other officials under its protection. It has also managed a growing number of high-profile government figures asking for support. Staffing has not kept pace with the workload increase. Around Sept. 11 there were about 15 full-time protectees. That number has now more than doubled. Trump is the first modern ex-president to seek another term, and because of his high visibility, his protective detail has always been larger than some others. That protective bubble got tighter in recent months as he drew closer to the nomination. All major party nominees are granted enhanced details with counterassault and countersniper teams similar to the president. Calls for accountabilityThere were calls for accountability across the political spectrum, with congressional committees immediately moving to investigate and issuing subpoenas. Top Republican leaders from both the House and the Senate said Cheatle should step down. Biden, a Democrat, ordered an independent review into security at the rally, and the Secret Service’s inspector general opened an investigation. The agency is also reviewing its countersniper team’s “preparedness and operations.” On Tuesday, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said Cheatle’s resignation was “overdue.” “Now we have to pick up the pieces. We have to rebuild the American people’s faith and trust in the Secret Service as an agency,” Johnson said. Meanwhile, Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., introduced legislation Tuesday to require Senate confirmation of future Secret Service directors. Cheatle served in the Secret Service for 27 years. She left in 2021 for a job as a security executive at PepsiCo before Biden asked her to return in 2022 to head the agency. She took over amid a controversy over missing text messages from around the time thousands of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, following his 2020 election loss to Biden. During her time at the agency, Cheatle was the first woman to be named assistant director of protective operations, the division that protects the president and other dignitaries, where she oversaw a $133.5 million budget. She was the second woman to lead the agency. When Biden announced Cheatle’s appointment, he said she had served on his detail when he was vice president and he and his wife “came to trust her judgment and counsel.”

July 21 was world's hottest day in at least 84 years: European climate agency,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/july-21-was-worlds-hottest-day-in-at-least-84-years-european-climate-agency-12776614.html,World,"July 24, 2024 09:33 AM","The Earth experienced its hottest day in at least 84 years, with the global average temperature reaching a record high of 17.09 degrees Celsius on July 21, according to the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). This follows a series of monthly heat records -- June marked the 12th consecutive month of global temperatures reaching or exceeding the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold. Every month since June last year has been the warmest on record. Preliminary data from C3S showed that July 21 was the hottest day since at least 1940, surpassing the previous record of 17.08 degrees Celsius set on July 6, 2023. What stands out is the significant difference between the temperatures since July 2023 and all previous years. Before July 2023, the Earth's daily average temperature record, set in August 2016, was 16.8 degrees Celsius. However, since July 3, 2023, there have been 57 days with temperatures exceeding that previous record. Carlo Buontempo, director of C3S, said the difference between the temperatures over the past 13 months and previous records is staggering. ""We are now in truly uncharted territory and as the climate continues to warm, we are bound to see new records in the coming months and years,"" he said. Analysis shows that 2023 and 2024 have seen significantly higher annual maximum daily global temperatures compared to previous years. The 10 years with the highest daily average temperatures are from 2015 to 2024. The global average temperature usually peaks between late June and early August, driven by the northern hemisphere's summer. The land masses in the northern hemisphere warm up faster than the southern hemisphere's oceans can cool down. With global average temperatures already at near-record levels, a new daily average temperature record was not completely unexpected. C3S scientists attributed the sudden rise in daily global temperatures to much higher-than-average temperatures over large parts of Antarctica. Such large anomalies are not uncommon during the Antarctic winter and also contributed to record global temperatures in early July 2023. The Antarctic Sea ice extent is almost as low as it was last year, leading to above-average temperatures over parts of the Southern Ocean. As the global average temperature typically peaks between late June and early August, scientists expect it to rise and peak around July 22 or 23, 2024, before decreasing. The European climate agency said whether 2024 will be the warmest year ever depends largely on the development and intensity of La NiÃ±a. While 2024 has been warm enough to surpass 2023, the exceptional warmth of the last four months of 2023 makes it too early to predict with certainty which year will be warmer. Climate science non-profit Berkeley Earth estimated last week that 2024 has a 92 per cent chance of setting a new annual heat record. There is a 99 per cent chance that 2024 will have an annual average temperature anomaly of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above the 1850-1900 average, it said. At the 2015 UN climate talks in Paris, world leaders committed to limiting the global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial period average to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. However, a permanent breach of the 1.5-degree Celsius limit specified in the Paris Agreement refers to long-term warming over a 20 or 30-year period. The Earth's global surface temperature has already increased by around 1.2 degrees Celsius due to the rapidly-increasing concentration of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide and methane, in the atmosphere. This warming is considered to be the reason behind record droughts, wildfires and floods worldwide.

Alphabet's results underscore robust demand for digital ads, driven by events like the Paris Olympics and elections in several countries including the U.S., while a recovery in enterprise spending is boosting its software business. Strong adoption of generative artificial intelligence technology drove its cloud business. Advertising sales, Alphabet's chief revenue source, rose 11% to $64.6 billion. The company sells ads in its search product using customer data to better target them. Net income in the quarter ended June 30 rose 28.6% to $23.6 billion, besting the average estimate of $22.9 billion. Investor reaction was mixed, with the shares initially rising about 2% before dipping by a similar percentage. They had gained more than 30% this year, outperforming a 20% rise in tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index. ""This was another stellar quarter from Google with beats across the board,"" said Ido Caspi a research analyst with Global X, citing ad sales and artificial intelligence offerings as drivers. Total revenue grew 14% to $84.74 billion, compared with analysts' consensus estimate of $84.19 billion according to LSEG data. Ad sales in its YouTube division rose 13% to $8.67 billion. Revenue from cloud computing services, a widely watched barometer for the health of enterprise technology spending, rose 28.8% to $10.35 billion. Analysts had expected $10.16 billion. Alphabet reported capital expenditures of $13 billion in the June quarter. Ruth Porat, in her last conference call as Alphabet's chief financial officer, told investors that quarterly capital expenditures for the rest of 2024 would be at or above $12 billion. In the January-March period, the company's capital expenditure had jumped 91% to $12 billion, spooking investors. Like its competitors, Alphabet is racing to roll out AI offerings as investors continue to pour billions into the technology. But its AI searches have produced a series of embarrassing results, such as the widely ridiculed suggestion to put glue on pizza to better hold cheese. Google pulled back on the technology in May to work out kinks. The technology will be rolled out to more countries, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai told investors on a call on Tuesday. ""You'll see us expand the use cases around it."" Pichai, without providing a timeline, said AI products could soon drive revenue rather than just help companies through cost-cutting and greater efficiency. Despite heightened regulatory scrutiny, Google had been pursuing its largest acquisition ever, a roughly $23 billion buyout of cybersecurity firm Wiz. But Wiz told employees on Monday it was walking away from the deal and would instead pursue going public. Google also held talks to acquire customer relationship management firm HubSpot before walking away from it earlier this month. The deal would have turned Alphabet into a rival of Salesforce, Oracle and others in that market. Google said on Monday it is planning to keep third-party cookies in its Chrome browser backtracking function after years of pledging to phase out the tiny packets of code used to track internet searches. It marked a major reversal after advertisers expressed concerns that the loss of cookies would limit their ability to collect and parse information for personalizing ads, making them dependent on Google's user databases. Sales for the Mountain View, California company's so-called ""other bets,"" including experimental projects and its self-driving car unit Waymo, rose 28% to $365 million. Porat said the company is planning a multi-year $5 billion investment in Waymo, as rival Cruise slowly maps a course back to U.S. roads after a highly publicized accident in October.

The company said it was on track to produce new vehicles, including more affordable models, in the first half of 2025, although the models will result in achieving less cost reduction than previously expected. Shares fell 8% in after-hours trade. ""Perhaps more than ever in the company's recent history, Tesla's investors need results; those will have to come fast - both for the humanoid robot and for the Robotaxi,"" said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com. The second quarter was tumultuous, with CEO Elon Musk shelving development of an all-new cheaper car in favor of less ambitious lower-cost models and working on creating self-driving taxis, helping to boost shares. The company also laid off more than 10% of its employees to cut costs, and Tesla said profit was also weighed down by restructuring charges and an increase in operating expenses largely driven by artificial-intelligence projects. Tesla recorded automotive gross margin excluding regulatory credits of 14.6% in the second quarter, compared with estimates of 16.29%, according to 20 analysts polled by Visible Alpha. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said Tesla has now missed earnings targets for four quarters in a row. ""There is a lot of talk about robotaxis, humanoid robots and autonomous driving, which provides an exciting narrative for investors but doesn't get over the fact that these are tomorrow's potential riches, not today""s."" Musk told analysts on a conference call that new competitors ""have discounted their EVs very substantially, which has made it a bit more difficult for Tesla."" The company's electric vehicle deliveries have fallen for two consecutive quarters as the automaker battles rising competition and slow demand stemming from a lack of affordable new models. Tesla's sales of China-made EVs, which are also exported to Europe and elsewhere, slumped in the second quarter from a year earlier, whereas BYD Co and other Chinese automakers posted strong sales growth. Tesla said on Tuesday it expected a sequential increase in production in the third quarter. The company reported revenue of $25.50 billion for the quarter, slightly ahead of last year and analyst targets, according to LSEG data. Tesla's sales of regulatory credits nearly tripled to a record $890 million in the second quarter from a year earlier. Traditional automakers buy credits from Tesla to meet clean-vehicle production regulatory targets. Net income was $1.48 billion in the second quarter, compared with $2.70 billion a year ago, with adjusted earnings of 52 cents per share missing the Wall Street consensus of 62 cents, as calculated by LSEG. ROBOTAXIS Shares of Tesla have surged more than 30% since June 13, when shareholders voted to approve Musk's $56 billion pay package that was invalidated by a Delaware court in January. Its shares were also boosted by hopes for robotaxis. Musk over the years has promoted Tesla as a technology company, most recently saying self-driving technology was key. Predictions of that technology maturing have been missed for years, but on Tuesday he forecast self-driving software would be able to drive Tesla vehicles without human supervision next year, saying he would be shocked if that were not the case. Tesla said on Tuesday the ""timing of Robotaxi deployment depends on technological advancement and regulatory approval."" But Musk said during the conference call, ""I don't think regulatory approval will be a limiting factor."" He also said Tesla was likely to win regulatory approval for its ""supervised"" Full Self-Driving software, which requires driver attention, in China and Europe by the end of this year. Musk said Tesla has delayed the unveiling of its Robotaxi product to Oct. 10 from Aug. 8 to make some important changes to the robotaxi. He had announced the Aug.  8 unveiling date after Reuters reported that Tesla had pivoted to self-driving taxis after shelving plans to develop a long-promised all-new cheaper car expected to be priced at around $25,000. ""Elon is great at dangling the carrot in front of investors, but new ideas tend to be long on vision, but short on execution,"" said David Wagner, head of equity and portfolio manager at Tesla investor Aptus Capital Advisors. Musk had said in 2022 that Tesla expected to mass-produce a robotaxi with no steering wheel or pedal by 2024. General Motors said on Tuesday its Cruise self-driving unit will focus its development efforts on a next-generation Chevrolet Bolt as it indefinitely delays its planned Origin vehicle that would not have a steering wheel. Tesla said Cybertruck production ""remains on track to achieve profitability by end of year."" Tesla said it has started validation of its first prototype Cybertruck vehicles using its breakthrough battery manufacturing technology called dry coating, which is ""a major cost reduction milestone once ramped"" and that production could launch in the fourth quarter.

That compares with a marginal two-point deficit Biden faced against Trump in last week's poll before his Sunday exit from the race. The new poll, conducted on Monday and Tuesday, followed both the Republican National Convention where Trump on Thursday formally accepted the nomination and Biden's announcement on Sunday he was leaving the race and endorsing Harris. Harris, whose campaign says she has secured the Democratic nomination, led Trump 44% to 42% in the national poll, a difference within the 3-percentage-point margin of error. Harris and Trump were tied at 44% in a July 15-16 poll, and Trump led by one percentage point in a July 1-2 poll, both within the same margin of error. While nationwide surveys give important signals of American support for political candidates, a handful of competitive states typically tilt the balance in the U.S. Electoral College, which ultimately decides who wins a presidential election. A pollster with Trump's campaign played down any polling showing an increase in Harris' support, arguing that she was likely to see a temporary rise in popularity because of widespread media coverage of her new candidacy. ""That bump is likely to start showing itself over the next few days and will last for a while,"" pollster Tony Fabrizio said in a memo circulated to reporters by Trump's campaign. Candidates often expect a bump after formally accepting their party's nomination at stage-managed, televised conventions such as the one that Trump had last week. But the poll showed no sign of that. Bump or not, the most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll underscored the rationale for Biden dropping out of the race and for Harris replacing him on the ticket. HARRIS SEEN AS SHARPER THAN BIDEN, TRUMP Some 56% of registered voters agreed with a statement that Harris, 59, was ""mentally sharp and able to deal with challenges,"" compared to 49% who said the same of Trump, 78. Only 22% of voters assessed Biden that way. Biden, 81, ended his reelection effort after a debate with Trump in which he often stammered and failed to aggressively challenge attacks by Trump that included falsehoods. Some 80% of Democratic voters said they viewed Biden favorably, compared to 91% who said the same of Harris. Three quarters of Democratic voters said they agreed with a statement that the party and voters should get behind Harris now, with only a quarter saying multiple candidates should compete for the party's nomination. When voters in the survey were shown a hypothetical ballot that included independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Harris led Trump 42% to 38%, an advantage outside the margin of error. Kennedy, favored by 8% of voters in the poll, has yet to qualify for the ballot in many states ahead of the Nov. 5 election. Harris campaigned in the critical battleground state of Wisconsin on Tuesday. She won support from major party figures and attention has since turned to who she will pick as her running mate. Many respondents in the Reuters/Ipsos poll said they knew nothing about the Democrats seen as potential picks to join Harris' ticket. About one in four registered voters said they had never heard of U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a former Democratic presidential candidate who had the highest favorability rating - 37% - of the potential Harris running mates in the poll. One in three had not heard of California Governor Gavin Newsom, with about the same share saying they looked on him favorably. Half of registered voters in the poll had never heard of Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and two thirds knew nothing of Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear. The poll, which was conducted online, surveyed 1,241 U.S. adults nationwide, including 1,018 registered voters.

"Kamala Harris bashes Donald Trump over 'fear and hate,' promises compassion in debut rally",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/kamala-harris-bashes-donald-trump-over-fear-and-hate-promises-compassion-in-debut-rally-12776535.html,World,"July 24, 2024 06:53 AM","U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris assailed Donald Trump on Tuesday at her first campaign rally since replacing President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate, while a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed her taking a marginal lead over her Republican rival. In a 17-minute speech, Harris aggressively went after Trump's vulnerabilities, comparing her background as a former prosecutor to his record as a convicted felon. Harris ticked through a list of liberal priorities, saying that if elected she would act to expand abortion access, make it easier for workers to join unions and address gun violence, drawing a sharp contrast with Trump, the Republican nominee for president in the Nov. 5 election. ""Donald Trump wants to take our country backward,"" she told a cheering crowd of several thousand at West Allis Central High School in a Milwaukee suburb in Wisconsin, a battleground state with a pivotal role in deciding the election outcome. ""Do we want to live in a country of freedom, compassion and rule of law, or a country of chaos, fear and hate?"" The raucous rally was a notable contrast to the smaller, more subdued events Biden held, underscoring Democrats' hope that Harris, 59, can revive what had been a flagging campaign under Biden, 81. The audience danced and waved Harris signs, while chants of ""Ka-ma-la!"" broke out when she took the stage. She emphasized her commitment to reproductive rights, an issue that has plagued Republicans since the U.S. Supreme Court - powered by three Trump-appointed justices - eliminated a nationwide right to abortion in 2022. Harris led Trump 44% to 42% among registered voters in the national Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted on Monday and Tuesday after Biden dropped out of the contest on Sunday and endorsed Harris as his successor. A Reuters/Ipsos poll last week showed Biden, before he ended his campaign, trailing Trump by two percentage points. Both were within the poll's three-point margin of error. But the results could signal limited movement in Democrats' direction - and may suggest that Harris' elevation to the top of the ticket blunted whatever momentum Trump hoped to gain from last week's Republican National Convention, also in Milwaukee. Trump and his allies have tried to tether Harris to some of Biden's more unpopular policies, including his administration's handling of the surge of migrants at the southern border with Mexico. In a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, Trump expressed confidence in his ability to defeat Harris, noting that her previous presidential run in 2020 did not even survive until the first statewide nominating contest. Trump offered to debate Harris multiple times. Trump and Biden had one more debate scheduled on Sept. 10 after their encounter on June 27. Biden's poor performance that night led to Democratic calls for him to step aside. ""I want to debate her, and she'll be no different because they have the same policies,"" Trump said. A SWIFT RISE Harris swiftly consolidated her party's support after Biden, 81, abandoned his reelection campaign under pressure from members of his party who worried about his ability to beat Trump, 78, or to serve for another four-year term. She wrapped up the nomination on Monday night by winning pledges from a majority of the delegates who at next month's party convention will determine the nominee, the campaign said. Her campaign said it had raised $100 million since Sunday. Most Democratic lawmakers have lined up behind her candidacy, including the party's leaders in the Senate and House, Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, who endorsed Harris on Tuesday at a joint press conference. Harris' rise dramatically reshapes an election in which many voters were unhappy with their options. As the first Black woman and Asian American to serve as vice president, she would make further history as the first woman elected U.S. president. Wisconsin is among a trio of Rust Belt states, along with Michigan and Pennsylvania, that are critical to Democrats' chances of defeating Trump. Alyssa Wahlberg, 19, chair of the Whitewater College Democrats, said Harris had reenergized young voters, particularly women who want Harris to break the ultimate U.S. glass ceiling. ""I talked to my grandmom. We are both excited that she may live to see the first woman president,"" said Wahlberg, who was attending Tuesday's rally. ""It's taken too long."" Saddled with concerns that included his health and persistent high prices crimping Americans' household finances, Biden had been losing ground against Trump in opinion polls, particularly in the competitive states that are likely to decide the election, including the Sun Belt states of Arizona and Nevada. BIDEN TO ADDRESS NATION Biden said on X that he would deliver a Wednesday night Oval Office speech explaining his decision to end his campaign. He returned to Washington on Tuesday after spending several days isolating at home with COVID-19. The president has tested negative and no longer has symptoms, the White House doctor said in a letter on Tuesday. Biden's dramatic exit followed Trump's narrow survival of a July 13 assassination attempt that raised questions about security failures in the U.S. Secret Service. The agency director, Kimberly Cheatle, resigned on Tuesday. The Washington Post reported that Secret Service officials have encouraged the Trump campaign to stop holding outdoor rallies like the one in Butler, Pennsylvania, where Trump was wounded in the right ear. The Post cited unnamed people familiar with the matter. The Secret Service and the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Democratic National Committee chair Jaime Harrison, in an interview on NBC's ""Today"" program, said the party had to move quickly to get the ticket on ballots in all 50 states, and that Harris' vice presidential pick needed to be made by Aug. 7. Potential running mates include Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.

North Korean trash balloons have fallen on the compound of South Korea's presidential office,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/north-korean-trash-balloons-have-fallen-on-the-compound-of-south-koreas-presidential-office-12776526.html,World,"July 24, 2024 06:36 AM","Yonhap news agency says North Korean trash-carrying balloons have fallen on the compound of South Korea's presidential office. Yonhap gave no further details. But other South Korean media reported the balloons have caused no damages. South Korea's military earlier said North Korea flew more balloons likely carrying trash toward South Korea on Wednesday. It said the North Korean balloons were flying north of Seoul on Wednesday morning after crossing the border. North Korea flew more balloons likely carrying trash toward South Korea on Wednesday, Seoul officials said, days after South Korea boosted its frontline broadcasts of K-pop songs and propaganda messages across the rivals' heavily armed border. The tit-for-tat Cold War-style campaigns between the Koreas are inflaming tensions on the Korean Peninsula, with the rivals threatening stronger steps and warning of grave consequences. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement the North Korean balloons were flying north of Seoul on Wednesday morning after crossing the border. It urged people to be alert for falling objects. It was North Korea's 10th such launch since late May. The more than 2,000 huge balloons so far have dropped wastepaper, scraps of cloth, cigarette butts and even manure on South Korea. North Korea has said it was responding to South Korean activists scattering political leaflets across the border via their own balloons. Experts say North Korea considers South Korean civilian leafleting activities a major threat to its efforts to stop the inflow of foreign news and maintain its authoritarian rule. In furious responses to past South Korean leafletting, North Korea destroyed an empty South Korean-built liaison office in its territory in 2020 and fired at incoming balloons in 2014. The North's balloons haven't caused major damage but have raised security jitters among people worried North Korea could use such balloons to drop more hazardous materials like chemical and biological agents. South Korea said Sunday it was ramping up its anti-Pyongyang propaganda broadcasts from its loudspeakers at all major sites along the land border because North Korea was continuing launches of trash-carrying balloons. South Korea last Thursday restarted its loudspeaker broadcasts for the first time in about 40 days in retaliation for North Korea's previous balloon activities. Observers say South Korean propaganda broadcasts can demoralize frontline North Korean troops and residents. In 2015, North Korea fired artillery rounds across the border in anger over South Korea's restart of propaganda broadcasts, prompting the South to return fire. South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesperson Lee Sung Joon said the ongoing South Korean broadcasts include K-pop songs and news on South Korean economic development. South Korean media reported the broadcasts also contained news on the recent defection of a senior North Korean diplomat and called the mine-planting work by North Korean soldiers at the border ""hellish, slave-like lives."" South Korea has an estimated 40 loudspeakers 24 stationary and 16 mobile ones. South Korea's military said Monday it was fully operating the fixed loudspeakers and plans to use the mobile loudspeakers as well. South Korea's military has warned of other unspecified stronger steps if North Korea continues its balloon campaigns. North Korea hasn't made an official response to the South Korean propaganda broadcasts. But last week, Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, threatened new countermeasures against South Korean civilian leafleting as she warned that South Korean ""scum"" must be ready to pay ""a gruesome and dear price"" over their actions.

But it is somewhat of a muted greenlight as Samsung's HBM3 chips will, for now, only be used in a less sophisticated Nvidia graphics processing unit (GPU), the H20, which has been developed for the Chinese market in compliance with U.S. export controls, the people said. It was not immediately clear if Nvidia would use Samsung's HBM3 chips in its other AI processors or if the chips would have to pass additional tests before that could happen, they added. Samsung has also yet to meet Nvidia's standards for fifth-generation HBM3E chips and testing of those chips is continuing, the people added, declining to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to media. Nvidia and Samsung declined to comment. HBM is a type of dynamic random access memory or DRAM standard first produced in 2013 in which chips are vertically stacked to save space and reduce power consumption. A key component of GPUs for artificial intelligence, it helps process massive amounts of data produced by complex applications. Nvidia's approval of Samsung's HBM3 chips comes amid soaring demand for sophisticated GPUs created by the generative AI boom that Nvidia and other makers of AI chipsets are struggling to meet. There are only three main manufacturers of HBM - SK Hynix, Micron and Samsung - and with HBM3 also in short supply, Nvidia is keen to see Samsung clear its standards so that it can diversify its supplier base. Nvidia's need to have more access to HBM3 is also set to grow as SK Hynix - the clear leader in the field - plans to increase its HBM3E production and make less HBM3, two of the sources said. SK Hynix declined to comment. Samsung, the world's largest maker of memory chips, has been seeking to pass Nvidia's tests for both HBM3 and HBM3E since last year but has struggled due to heat and power consumption issues, Reuters reported in May, citing sources. Samsung said after the publication of the Reuters article in May that claims of failing Nvidia's tests due to heat and power consumption problems were untrue. H20 Samsung could begin supplying HBM3 for Nvidia's H20 processor as early as August, according to two of the sources. The H20 is the most advanced of three GPUs Nvidia has tailored for the China market after the U.S. tightened export restrictions in 2023, aiming to impede supercomputing and AI breakthroughs that could benefit the Chinese military. In accordance with U.S. sanctions, the H20's computing power has been significantly capped compared to the version sold in non-China markets, the H100. The H20 initially got off to a weak start when deliveries began this year and the U.S. firm priced it below a rival chip from Chinese tech giant Huawei, Reuters reported in May. But sales are now growing rapidly, separate sources have said.Â In contrast to Samsung, SK Hynix is the main supplier of HBM chips to Nvidia and has been supplying HBM3 since June 2022. It also began supplying HBM3E in late March to a customer it declined to identify. Shipments went to Nvidia, sources have said. Micron has also said it will supply Nvidia with HBM3E.

""It would be devastating for our competitors, and it would hurt Tesla slightly but long term probably actually helps Tesla would be my guess,"" Musk said in a post-earnings conference call after the EV maker reported its lowest profit margin in more than five years. Former President Trump, the Republican candidate supported by Musk, has been critical of the Biden administration's EV policies and has said that he will ""end the electric vehicle mandate"" if he wins office. Trump has not explained the plan in detail. Musk said any Trump removal of subsidies, and the resulting impact on Tesla car sales was not crucial because Tesla is an artificial intelligence company focused on self-driving technology. ""The value of Tesla overwhelmingly is autonomy. These other things are in the noise relative to autonomy,"" Musk said. The billionaire announced his endorsement of Trump shortly after an assassination attempt on the presidential candidate this month. Musk has denied a media report that he pledged to donate $45 million per month to Trump, but he said he had created a political action committee. Musk's support for Trump created some confusion among Tesla fans who questioned how his election would help the EV company. Trump's pick for vice president, JD Vance, last year introduced a bill to eliminate EV subsidies and replace them with a credit to promote gas-powered vehicles, though it has virtually no chance of passing in the current Congress. Musk said in a post on X last week, ""Take away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla. Also, remove subsidies from all industries!"" In his acceptance speech at the Republican Party's convention last week in Milwaukee, Trump said his administration would slap tariffs of 100% to 200% on cars made in Mexico to make them ""unsellable"" in the United States. Musk said on Tuesday the EV maker has paused plans for a plant in Mexico and would reassess investing in a new gigafactory in the country after the U.S. presidential election. ""Trump has said that he will put heavy tariffs on vehicles produced in Mexico so it doesn't make sense to invest in Mexico,"" he said. Musk said Tesla is increasing capacity at its existing factories significantly and plans to produce robotaxis at its factory in Texas.

China's Foreign Ministry, which had been coordinating the dialogue among the rival factions for the past three days, stated on Tuesday that the declaration represents an initial step towards promoting a ""comprehensive, durable, and sustainable ceasefire"" in the Gaza Strip, which has been heavily impacted by Israeli attacks. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi who met the leader's factions said the signing of the agreement was ""an important, historic moment in the Palestinian cause"". He said that under the deal the rival groups had agreed to set up an ""interim national reconciliation government"" to govern post-war Gaza. The pact aims to unite Palestinians in their conflict with Israel which launched the war against Hamas in Gaza in October last year following the abduction of over 200 Israeli hostages. Signatories included senior Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk and Fatah envoy Mahmoud al-Aloul along with emissaries from 12 other Palestinian groups. The Chinese foreign ministry said it was the first time the 14 rival groups had gathered together in Beijing for reconciliation talks. ""Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community,"" Wang said. ""The core outcome is that the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organisation) is the sole legitimate representative of all Palestinian people"" Wang said, adding that ""an agreement has been reached on post-Gaza war governance and the establishment of a provisional national reconciliation government."" It was unclear from Wang's comments what role Hamas, which is not part of the PLO, would play in such an arrangement, or what the immediate impact of any deal would be. The agreement brokered by China without any involvement of Israel which spurned all international efforts until the hostages were released was seen as yet another diplomatic initiative by Beijing to further China's influence in West Asia. Hamas rules the Gaza Strip while Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which has partial administrative control of the West Bank. Israel, which has vowed to destroy Hamas before it will end the war in Gaza, swiftly dismissed the Beijing declaration. ""Instead of rejecting terrorism, Mahmoud Abbas embraces the murderers and rapists of Hamas, revealing his true face,"" Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on X. ""In reality, this won't happen because Hamas's rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands,"" Katz emphasised. In March last year, China brokered a peace deal between arch-rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia which enabled the two countries to establish diplomatic relations. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba is also visiting Beijing this week to discuss China's role in ending the Russia-Ukraine war as well as economic cooperation, Hong Kong-based South China Post reported.

"Britain: Violence against women reaches 'epidemic levels,' threat on par with terrorism, warn UK police",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/britain-violence-against-women-reaches-epidemic-levels-threat-on-par-with-terrorism-warn-uk-police-12776433.html,World,"July 23, 2024 08:42 PM","The violence against women and girls has reached epidemic levels and police are treating it as a threat on the same scale as terrorism, Britain's police chiefs said Tuesday. More than 1 million violent crimes against women and girls were recorded by UK police from 2022 to 2023, accounting for one-fifth of all recorded crimes, a new report commissioned by the National Police Chief's Council and the College of Policing said. One in every six murders was related to domestic abuse in the same period. At least one in every 12 women each year will be a victim of crimes including sexual offenses, rape, stalking, harassment or online sexual abuse, the report estimated, with the exact number thought to be much higher because of crimes that go unreported. ""Violence against women and girls is a national emergency,"" Deputy Chief Constable Maggie Blyth said in a statement. ""We need to move forward as a society to make change and no longer accept violence against women and girls as inevitable."" Blyth said the data was ""staggering"" and growing in scale and complexity every year, with such crimes increasing by 37% from 2018 to 2022. She said one growing concern is the way some online influencers ""radicalize"" young men and boys into extreme misogyny. Senior officers focusing on violence against women are in discussions with counterterrorism police on how to tackle the issue, Blyth said. Teachers in the UK have expressed worries about the spread of ""toxic masculinity"" among boys influenced by the misogynistic views of some social media personalities. Britain's government last year classified violence against women and girls as a national threat to public safety, and police forces were told to prioritize their response to the issue in the same way as they do terrorism and serious organised crime. The report said thousands of police officers were newly trained to investigate rape and serious sexual offenses in the past year. But Blyth said this wasn't enough and called for more government support to tackle a criminal justice system that's ""overwhelmed and under-performing for victims.""

Kimberly Cheatle, who had served as Secret Service director since August 2022, had been facing growing calls to resign and several investigations into how the shooter was able to get so close to the Republican presidential nominee at an outdoor campaign rally in Pennsylvania. ""I take full responsibility for the security lapse,"" she said in the email to staff Tuesday. ""In light of recent events, it is with a heavy heart that I have made the difficult decision to step down as your director."" Cheatle's resignation comes a day after appeared before a congressional committee and was berated by hours by both Democrats and Republicans for the security failures. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's 'most significant operational failure' in decades and said she takes fully responsibility for the security lapses, but angered lawmakers by failing to answer specific questions about the investigation. At the hearing Monday, Cheatle remained defiant that she was the 'right person' to lead the Secret Service, even as she said she took full responsibility the security lapses. When Republican Rep. Nancy Mace suggested Cheatle begin drafting her resignation letter from the hearing room, Cheatle responded, ""No, thank you."" The 20-year-old shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, was able to get within 135 meters (157 yards) of the stage where the former president was speaking when he opened fire. That's despite a threat on Trump's life from Iran leading to additional security for the former president in the days before the July 13 rally.

Neuralink's value jump leaves some Elon Musk employees itching to cash out,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/neuralinks-value-jump-leaves-some-elon-musk-employees-itching-to-cash-out-12776168.html,World,"July 23, 2024 03:42 PM","Some of the staff at Elon Musk's Neuralink are making preparations to sell the brain implant company's stock in the wake of its valuation jumping following its first human trial, according to people familiar with the matter. Stock compensation is a big incentive for employees at startups such as Neuralink. The shares they receive are not publicly traded, and employees that want to sell them without the company's blessing have to use complex turnarounds on niche private market exchanges. Now some of Neuralink's employees and investors are preparing for Musk's company to launch a tender offer as early as next month to buy back shares from staff that wish to sell, according to two sources briefed on the matter who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Neuralink and Musk did not respond to requests for comment. The jump in Neuralink's valuation following the launch of its first human trial in January is evident in secondary market trades. While these trades are thin in volume and do not provide a reliable number for Neuralink's current valuation, they all point to a rise in value -- some to as much as $8 billion, more than double what the company was worth last year. Neuralink has called its first human trial a success. It said it remedied an initial problem of the implant's threads retracting from its first patient's brain and is preparing for more trials in Britain and Canada. Musk recently said the company plans to implant a second patient soon. It could not be learned whether Neuralink has formally scheduled a tender offer or what its terms would be. Last fall, Neuralink launched a tender offer for employees that priced at around $19 per share, when some shares traded on the secondary market close to $35, according to a review of trades by Reuters and sources familiar with the matter. It is common for startups to launch tender offers at a discount to secondary market values. Musk has for years created scarcity for shares in his startups, which also include rocket company SpaceX and artificial intelligence developer xAI, turning them into exclusive clubs that accept only a few investors, such as Peter Thiel's Founders Fund. This scarcity has made the shares sought after and investors content with receiving little information on how the startups have fared once they invested, according to investors and people who have worked closely with Musk. A spokeswoman for Founders Fund declined to comment. The impact of this scarcity is reflected in recent trades. Buyers on private exchanges paid a premium of between 84% and 137% in the last few weeks to the $3.5 billion valuation Neuralink attained in its most recent private fundraising round last November, according to a Reuters analysis of trades recent trades and PitchBook data. Most startups' shares don't trade at such premiums, and the majority of them trade at a discount. The median private company trades at a 32% discount from the valuation of its most recent fundraising, according to brokerage Forge Global. BIG WINDFALL Neuralink's valuation has soared since it was started in 2016, and employees that were given shares at the launch or soon after at a fraction of their current value are in for a big windfall. Some buyers are offering as much as $50 a share, up from about $35 around when the human trial began in January, said Sim Desai, chief executive of Hiive, who said his secondary platform matches buyers and sellers interested in trading Neuralink shares. SpaceX, Musk's most valuable company besides electric car maker Tesla, also trades at a premium on the secondary market. One recent transaction at $130.11 valued the company at $232 billion, according to secondary trade data. The company valued itself at about $180 billion in a private fundraising round in April, according to Pitchbook. SpaceX did not respond to a comment request. The sources said Neuralink asks its employees not to trade their shares on the secondary market, preferring they sell stock during tender offers that the company can control. One reason, according to Hiive's Desai, is that federal regulation prevents private companies from having more than 2,000 direct shareholders. Allowing limitless trading on the secondary market, especially for hot companies like Neuralink, could push a company up against the limit, Desai said. The other reason is companies retaining the ability to funnel access to investors they want at their chosen price. ""Basically, it's an opportunity for a company, if they restrict the trades, to do their close friends and insiders a favor,"" Desai said. Due to restrictions on trading placed by Neuralink, Hiive only facilitates the matchmaking for shares, and the parties have to arrange for payment and the transfer of shares on their own, he said.

Ayadil Saparbekov, team lead for health emergencies at WHO in Gaza and the West Bank, said circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 had been isolated from environmental samples from sewage in Gaza. ""There is a high risk of spreading of the circulating vaccine-derived polio virus in Gaza, not only because of the detection but because of the very dire situation with the water sanitation,"" he told reporters in Geneva via video link from Jerusalem. ""It may also spill over internationally, at a very high point."" Saparbekov said WHO and UNICEF workers were scheduled to arrive in Gaza on Thursday to collect human stool samples as part of a risk assessment related to the discovery of the virus. He said the assessment, which he hoped would be completed by the end of the week, would allow health officials to issue recommendations, ""including the need for a mass vaccination campaign as well as what kind of vaccine should be used and what the age group of the population that will need to be vaccinated"". Poliomyelitis, which is spread mainly through the fecal-oral route, is a highly infectious virus that can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis. It mainly affects children under the age of 5. Israel's military said on Sunday it would start offering the polio vaccine to soldiers serving in the Gaza Strip after remnants of the contagious polio virus were found in test samples in areas of the coastal enclave. The military also said that with the cooperation of international groups enough vaccines had been brought in to cover more than one million people in Gaza, which has a total population of around 2.3 million. Without proper health services, the population of Gaza is particularly vulnerable to outbreaks of disease, public health officials and aid groups say. ""I'm extremely worried about an outbreak happening in Gaza. And this is not only polio, different outbreaks of communicable diseases,"" Saparbekov said.

Volkswagen is reeling in China. Can EVs help it grow in the US?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/volkswagen-is-reeling-in-china-can-evs-help-it-grow-in-the-us-12775841.html,World,"July 23, 2024 12:52 PM","When Volkswagen Group last month invested $5 billion in U.S. electric truck-and-SUV maker Rivian, the startup's shares soared on the cash infusion. And Volkswagen's stock dropped 1.6%. Some analysts praised the creation of a Volkswagen-Rivian joint venture to help the German giant with software. But the investment raised cost concerns and reinforced how Volkswagen's problems in critical areas undermined its EV transition globally. The world's second-largest automaker faces a vexing landscape of challenges in Europe, the U.S. and especially China, where domestic EV makers led by BYD are swiping its market share. It has lost more stock value than any major competitor over the past two years. By 2030, Volkswagen plans more than 30 new electric or hybrid models in China and hopes to boost sales to about 4 million, from about 3 million today, lifting its market share to 15%. But in the near term, Volkswagen CFO Arno Antlitz told Reuters the company expects to continue losing China market share and hopes to merely maintain its position in Europe. Volkswagen's troubles in China underscore bleak prospects for foreign automakers in the country, where homegrown EV-makers are dominating the world's fastest electric-vehicle transition with high-tech, low-cost models. Volkswagen is particularly vulnerable because China accounts for about a third of its sales. That leaves Volkswagen's much-smaller U.S. operation shouldering its biggest growth ambitions: the carmaker plans to more than double its U.S. market share to 10% by 2030. About a dozen investors and analysts interviewed by Reuters expressed skepticism that the automaker has found the formula to achieve a sales boom. Volkswagen, they said, lacks a distinctive U.S. brand identity or breakthrough product plans in a crowded market that favors larger vehicles and has proven resistant to EVs. One upside: VW won't have to compete with Chinese EVs in the U.S., which in May levied 100% tariffs on them. Speaking with Reuters in February, Antlitz said Volkswagen has launched initiatives to boost its competitiveness in China over the next two years. ""Until then,"" he said, ""we do not expect rising market share rather the opposite."" In a written response to questions last week, a Volkswagen spokesperson added that the automaker expects to achieve cost parity with local competitors for compact cars by 2026, and aims to remain the largest international carmaker in China and third-largest overall. ""Profitability is our top priority,"" the spokesperson said. ""We will not grow at any price."" Volkswagen's China share dropped from 19% in 2019 to 14.5% last year. It has notched modest sales growth in the U.S. but will need to supercharge that to meet its market-share target. The Rivian tie-up is part of that U.S. strategy but won't result in any new models to boost sales. The 50-50 venture will instead develop software and other technology for both automakers. Still, Volkswagen said it hopes products made with technology produced by the venture will attract new customers. Rivian declined to comment on how it could influence Volkswagen's sales. Volkswagen said it is planning more than 30 battery-electric models for the U.S. market, without providing details. What's known is that Volkswagen will launch two electric models, a pickup and an SUV, in late 2026 under the Scout nameplate, a historic American off-road brand, to be built at a new $2 billion South Carolina factory with capacity for 200,000 units. Scout CEO Scott Keogh told Reuters the plant could expand to double that size, but declined to say what output he expected by 2030. Continuing on the retro theme, Volkswagen will release an electric version of its iconic Microbus called the ID. Buzz later this year. It also plans new gas-powered SUVs, VW's U.S. chief Pablo di Si said in an April interview with Reuters, and possibly new plug-in hybrids. ""I know we have aggressive targets,"" di Si said. ""Our plans are very solid."" Investors will need convincing. Volkswagen faces entrenched competitors in hybrids (Toyota, Ford) and SUVs (GM, Ford, Toyota). EV demand is waning globally but especially in the U.S., where they accounted for 8% of all 2023 sales. Jeffrey Scharf, a former Volkswagen investor who now owns Mercedes-Benz stock, called VW's market-share goal ""hopelessly optimistic."" ""If they had something like full self-driving or some other unique feature before anyone else did, I'd see it,"" he said. ""But they don't have a recognizable niche anymore."" 'WISHFUL THINKING' Volkswagen's predicament reflects an industry shake-up stemming from the breakneck pace of electric-vehicle development in China, where domestic brands have tapped government subsidies and the nation's superior battery supply chains. EVs and hybrids represent about 40% of China's new car sales, according to the China Passenger Car Association. Foreign brands' China market share has fallen to 44% in the first four months of this year from 62% in 2019. VW has fared better than some: GM's China sales slumped by more than half this year so far. Volkswagen is spending heavily to stop the bleeding. In April, it announced a $2.7 billion investment in an EV design-and-production hub in Anhui province. That followed a $700 million investment in Chinese EV maker Xpeng last December to develop EV platforms and software, along with two EV models by 2026. But for now, the automaker must accept a diminished role in China's EV market, six industry analysts told Reuters. Volkswagen also faces challenges in hitting its U.S. market-share target. Investors and analysts said Volkswagen needs to make products that spark the kind of enthusiasm as its historic successes from the Beetle to the Microbus to the Golf. VW's current SUV lineup, including the full-sized Atlas, is tailored to American tastes but the company's badge is not quite premium nor economy, said Roger Norberg, director of equity research at Thrivent Financial, a VW investor, who called the automaker's market-share target ""wishful thinking."" Keogh said Scout will deliver larger vehicles that appeal to U.S. buyers seeking a car with an American feel. ""To make growth happen, you have to go into these new segments,"" Keogh said. Still, investors highlighted that all-electric trucks and SUVs have attracted relatively few sales despite high-profile offerings from Ford, GM, Tesla and Rivian. Both the Scouts will start at $50,000-$60,000, Keogh said. VW declined to comment on the pricing of the ID. Buzz. U.S. chief di Si said new SUVs will be ""critical in terms of volume, share and profit,"" but did not provide product details or clarity on where the company sees room for a new volume-seller. Volkswagen already offers small, medium and large SUVs. Its larger Atlas has boosted the carmaker's SUV sales in the U.S., which rose 23% in the second quarter. Volkswagen is still wavering on plug-in hybrids. Executives once lauded hybrids as a bridge to fully electric cars but shifted to prioritize EVs after VW's 2015 diesel-emissions scandal. Now, automakers that stuck with hybrids, including Toyota and Ford, are seeing their sales jump. ""Investing money in hybrid versions of selected models would be better spent than in Scout,"" said Moritz Kronenberger, portfolio manager at VW shareholder Union Investment. ""I have yet to find anyone who yells 'hooray!' about the plans for Scout.""

Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. will start divesting their stakes in Toyota, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. Tokio Marine Holdings Inc. and MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings Inc. are set to announce the sale of their shares as well, the people said, adding that the information is scheduled for release later Tuesday. Representatives for Toyota, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Tokio Marine declined to comment. A representative for MS&AD didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The Japanese government has been pushing big businesses in Japan to unwind cross-held shares, which were forged over decades to cement business relationships. While that has brought some measure of shareholder accountability and improved governance to the corporate sector, the biggest banks and businesses had been slow to unwind their holdings. Given its scale and significance, the Toyota deal could trigger a broader wave of looser equity ties in Japan. In June, Bloomberg News reported that Mitsubishi and Sumitomo were planning to start divesting their stakes in Toyota, worth ¥1.32 trillion. In addition to MS&AD Insurance and Tokio Marine, Sompo Holdings Inc. holds a significant stake in in Toyota. If all of them were to divest shares, the total would top ¥3 trillion. The banks and insurers are said to be planning to divest their Toyota shareholdings over an extended period of time lasting a few years, dramatically reducing their stakes or divesting them entirely. The sale follows a banner year for Toyota, which saw shares climb 26% this year on top of a 43% rally in 2023. Some Japanese insurers have already hinted at plans to significantly reduce or eliminate their cross-shareholdings, which authorities believe are a cause of price fixing with corporate clients. Toyota is also looking to unwind its shares in its various business partners. Earlier this year, the carmaker announced plans to sell part of its stake in parts supplier Aisin Corp. Denso Corp. and Toyota Industries Corp. also said they’ll unwind their holdings in Aisin. In November, the carmaker said it would lower its stake in electric parts maker Denso to 20% from 24%. Prior to that, Toyota committed to selling some of its stake in telecommunications company KDDI Corp. for ¥250 billion. While the sales serve the purpose of freeing up money that can be used to fund Toyota’s shift to electric vehicles, they also be used toward buybacks.

The government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had scrapped the quotas in 2018. On Sunday, the Supreme Court agreed to scrap most of the quotas and Hasina approved the verdict late on Monday. The government's acceptance of the court ruling is expected to be published in its formal record on Tuesday, media reports said, in line with one of the demands of the protesters. Hasina on Monday blamed her political opponents for violence and said the curfew, imposed since Friday, would be lifted ""whenever the situation gets better"". The protesters have given the government 48 hours to meet 8 demands, which include a public apology from Hasina and the reopening of the university campuses that were shut when the violence began. Malaysia on Tuesday joined the list of countries trying to evacuate its citizens from Bangladesh because of the violence, with the foreign ministry saying the flight was expected to arrive in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday afternoon. India also said at least 4,500 Indian students had returned home over the last few days from Bangladesh.

Digital tax talks in G20 spotlight as US tariff threat looms,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/digital-tax-talks-in-g20-spotlight-as-us-tariff-threat-looms-12775575.html,World,"July 23, 2024 10:49 AM","Talks over a global tax deal are continuing well past a June 30 deadline and governments are now looking to a Group of 20 finance leaders meeting this week for progress on a stalled plan to reallocate taxing rights on large multinational companies. The so-called ""Pillar 1"" arrangement, part of a 2021 global two-part tax deal, aims to replace unilateral digital services taxes (DSTs) on U.S. tech giants including Alphabet's Google, Amazon.com and Apple through a new mechanism to share taxing rights on a broader, global group of companies. The stakes in the negotiations are high. A failure to reach agreement on final terms could prompt several countries to reinstate their taxes on U.S. tech giants and risk punitive duties on billions of dollars in exports to the U.S. Standstill agreements under which Washington has suspended threatened trade retaliation against seven countries -- Austria, Britain, France, India, Italy, Spain and Turkey -- expired on June 30, but the U.S. has not taken steps to impose tariffs. Discussions on the matter are continuing. An Italian government source said that European countries were seeking assurances that the U.S. tariffs on some $2 billion worth of annual imports from French Champagne to Italian handbags and optical lenses remained frozen while the talks continue, including at the G20 meeting in Rio de Janeiro. TOP PRIORITY A European Union document prepared for the G20 meeting lists finalizing the international tax deal as a ""top priority."" It said the G20 should urge countries and jurisdictions participating in the tax deal ""to finalize discussions on all aspects of Pillar 1, with a view to signing the Multilateral Convention (MLC) by summer end and ratifying it as soon as possible."" Meanwhile, Canada in July became the eighth country to impose a unilateral digital services tax, with Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland saying it was ""simply not reasonable, not fair for Canada to indefinitely put our own measures on hold"" after the June 30 deadline passed without a Pillar 1 agreement. The U.S. maintains that such taxes are discriminatory because they specifically target the local revenues of U.S. technology firms that dominate the sector. ""Treasury continues to oppose all tax measures that discriminate against U.S. businesses,"" a U.S. Treasury spokesperson said in response to Canada's move. ""We encourage all countries to finalize the work on the Pillar 1 agreement. We are in active discussions on next steps related to the existing DST joint statements."" A spokesperson for the U.S. Trade Representative's office added that the OECD/G20 negotiations ""offer the best path to address challenges that digitalization of the economy poses to the international tax system."" SMALLER FIRMS AFFECTED Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Reuters at a G7 finance meeting in May that India and China were hindering agreement on the alternative transfer-pricing mechanism known as ""Amount B."" This mechanism would apply to thousands of companies below the $20 billion annual revenue threshold for ""Amount A"", and is aimed at delivering tax certainty to these firms through an objective way of calculating tax liability, said Danielle Rolfes, head of KPMG's Washington National Tax Practice. ""It's in the interest of all the countries around the table to try to keep it alive,"" Rolfes said. At the G20 meeting in Rio de Janeiro, Yellen will also face questions from counterparts over the continuity of U.S. policy commitments in the wake of President Joe Biden's decision to end his re-election bid and growing international angst over a potential return of Donald Trump to the White House.

"Joe Biden to campaign for Kamala Harris, terms decision to drop out of presidential race 'right thing to do'",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/joe-biden-to-campaign-for-kamala-harris-terms-decision-to-drop-out-of-presidential-race-right-thing-to-do-12775356.html,World,"July 23, 2024 06:41 AM","US President Joe Biden has described his decision to drop out of the presidential race as ""the right thing to do"" and said he would campaign with his deputy Kamala Harris, whom he has endorsed as the Democratic Party's new nominee, for the November general elections. In a telephonic address on Monday to his former campaign team, which has now been rechristened Harris Campaign, Biden urged the members to ""embrace"" Vice President Harris (59) while asserting that the name of the campaign has changed but the mission remains the same -- defeating Donald Trump. Biden's decision to nominate Harris follows weeks of intense pressure from fellow Democrats after his disastrous presidential debate performance against his Republican rival and former US President Donald Trump last month. The 82-year-old US president, who is in self-isolation after testing positive for COVID-19, called the campaign headquarters on Monday moments before Harris made the maiden address to the team. ""If I didn't have Covid, I'd be sitting there with you, standing there with you. I'm so proud of what you've all done. Covid is keeping me out of people's hair for the next three or four days, but I'm going to be on the road, and I'm not going anywhere. ""It has kept me away a little bit, but I want people to remember that what we have done has been incredible and we're going to get so much more done,"" Biden told the team over the phone. He urged the staffers of his former campaign team to embrace Kamala Harris, work unitedly and defeat Trump. ""I want to tell the team, embrace her. She's the best. I want to thank everybody for their effort. I know yesterday's news is surprising and hard for you to hear, but it was the right thing to do. I know it's hard because you poured your heart and soul into me to help us win this thing, help me get this nomination, help me win the nomination, and then go on to win the presidency,"" the incumbent US president said. ""But you're an amazing team... I think we made the right decision. I know how hard you've worked and how many sacrifices you've made. So many of you uprooted your lives for me -- the kind of commitment few people make for anything these days, but you made it,"" he told the campaign team. Biden said that the name has changed but the mission hasn't changed at all. ""I'm not going anywhere. I'm going to be out there in the campaign with Kamala. I'm going to work like hell, both as a sitting president, getting legislation passed, as well as campaigning. ""What we still need to save is democracy. Trump is still a danger to the community. He's a danger to the nation. Just ask my foreign policy colleagues, my counterparts and other people around the world and at home. I'm hoping you'll give every bit of your heart and soul that you gave to me to Kamala,"" the president added. Kevin Munoz, the spokesperson for Harris' campaign, has claimed that there has been a groundswell behind Kamala Harris and the campaign has raised USD 81 million in its first 24 hours, adding to the near quarter-of-a-billion dollar war chest already amassed this election cycle. Though Biden's endorsement almost seals Harris' position as the presidential nominee of her party, she still needs to get elected by the party's delegates during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago from August 19-22. Biden has won 3,896 delegates as against 1,976 required to win the party's presidential nomination. In a move that would give her access to the campaign funds, the Biden-Harris campaign amended filings with the Federal Election Commission to rename its principal committee and declare Harris a candidate for president. Following Biden's decision, Harris, who has been serving as the US' first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president since 2021, immediately secured the endorsement of former president Bill Clinton, thus making it a bit easier for her to win the delegate battle during the party convention. An ""overwhelming majority"" of state Democratic Party chairs have announced their support for Vice President Harris as their nominee for president, the Association of State Democratic Committees (ASDC) has said in a statement.

"Black voters feel excitement, hope and a lot of worry as Kamala Harris takes centre stage in campaign",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/black-voters-feel-excitement-hope-and-a-lot-of-worry-as-kamala-harris-takes-centre-stage-in-campaign-12775340.html,World,"July 23, 2024 06:20 AM","Black voters expressed a mix of hope and worry on Monday over Joe Biden's exit from the presidential race and the prospect of Vice President Kamala Harris becoming the Democratic nominee. A key Democratic constituency, Black voters helped power Biden to victory in the 2020 primaries and ultimately to the White House, and they were among his most steadfast supporters, even as calls for him to quit grew. But as much pride as some Black Americans feel about the possibility of Harris, who is of Black and Indian descent, becoming president, the upending of the race has some voters feeling scared. ""I felt like we were doomed,"" said Brianna Smith, a 24-year-old school counselor from Decatur, Georgia, recounting her reaction to Biden's announcement. ""I don't see America actually accepting the fact that a Black woman is running for president."" Cyria Adams, a 37-year-old hairstylist from Smyrna, Georgia, called Biden's decision ""heartbreaking."" As speculation spread last week that the president might withdraw, she prayed it was just a rumour. ""I'm nervous. I'm really nervous,"" Adams said. Biden's support of Harris and the immediate coalescing of other party leaders around her makes her the prohibitive favourite to replace him at the top of the presidential ticket. But in interviews in Atlanta, where voters helped flip Georgia for Democrats four years ago, some Black voters were nervous. ""People really don't like women, especially Black women,"" said Mary Jameson, 46. ""If a white woman can't win, how can a Black woman win?"" Carrington Jackson, a 23-year-old chiropractic student from Marietta, Georgia, said she immediately felt fearful when Biden dropped out. Though she believes Harris is a great candidate, she worries about her facing not only the popularity of the GOP nominee, former President Donald Trump, but the prejudices of the American public. ""With me being a Black woman, I understand that she's at the intersection of sexism and racism,"" Jackson said. ""I think now that's going to be a whole other battle, as well as competing against Donald Trump's supporters."" An AP-NORC Centre for Public Affairs Research poll fielded prior to Biden's announcement Sunday found about 6 in 10 Democrats believe Harris would do well as president. More broadly, among all adults, the poll showed scepticism of Harris, with only 3 in 10 Americans saying she would do well as president. But Blacks were more likely to see Harris in a positive light. Many Democrats followed Biden's lead in expressing their support for Harris. The Congressional Black Caucus said it ""fully backs"" the vice president. And some Black voters, dismayed by what they saw as Biden's dwindling chance of winning in November, said they would support whoever could best compete with Trump. ""If they can express the policy of the Democratic Party better than Biden, then I will gladly take that person,"" said Pierre Varlet, 30, an anti-money laundering specialist in Atlanta.

Joe Biden's withdrawal from the US presidential race spells new uncertainty for Ukraine,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/joe-bidens-withdrawal-from-the-us-presidential-race-spells-new-uncertainty-for-ukraine-12775339.html,World,"July 23, 2024 06:16 AM","US President Joe Biden's decision to end his campaign for reelection brings a new element of uncertainty for Ukraine, which is struggling to fend off Russian advances even as it worries about the future of American support. The prospect of victory for former President Donald Trump, the Republican contender, has long concerned Kyiv, which fears he would choke off support and force Ukraine to sue for peace on terms that favor Russia. But while the Democrats hope Biden's decision to drop out and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris will inject energy into their campaign, it's unclear whether it makes Trump's defeat more likely. Officials in Moscow, widely thought to favor Trump, were noncommittal. Kyiv resident Yulia Loginova said she found it impossible to predict how Biden's departure would affect Ukraine. ""I don't know, honestly,"" she said. ""Surprises every day. But he did the right thing. Phillips O'""Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, said Biden's withdrawal ""changes the narrative of the campaign,"" but it's too soon to say how much it will alter the dynamic of the presidential election. Ukraine may be facing tough times regardless of who wins. While the US is Ukraine's most crucial backer, under Biden it has sometimes been seen as a frustrating friend. Standing in Kyiv's Independence Square beside a sea of small Ukrainian flags left in tribute to those killed in the war, a solider said victory ""is impossible without the support of the USA, that is a fact. They have the largest number of weapons, influence and everything."" Still, the solider, who gave only his nickname, Sadik, in line with military rules, said that had the US provided more support, ""the war would have ended a long time ago."" But a new Trump administration would make things far worse, he added. ""If Trump wins, there will be little or no weapons,"" he said, adding that he feared Ukraine would be forced into concessions to end the war, where the Kremlin's troops are making gradual battlefield gains. Trump has boasted that he could end the conflict within 24 hours, and Ukrainians think any such settlement would be on Russia's terms. Trump's choice of Sen. JD Vance, an opponent of US military aid to Ukraine, as vice-presidential running mate has triggered more alarm. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said during a visit to Britain last week that dealing with Trump would be hard work but he added Ukrainian's aren't afraid of hard work. Ukraine's leader and Trump spoke by phone on Friday, a call both men described as good on social media platform X. ""The current situation in Ukraine and all of Europe is no less challenging, and we sincerely hope that America's continued strong leadership will prevent Russian evil from succeeding or making its aggression pay off."" Zelenskyy wrote on X. Yet Ukraine's gratitude at US support tinged with frustration at its limitations. As Russia has stepped up attacks on Ukraine's cities and infrastructure, Zelenskyy's government has pushed for the Biden administration to authorize the use of American-supplied weapons to strike deep inside Russia. Ukraine wants to target the sites, often far from the border, that Moscow uses to launch airborne attacks on Ukraine. Washington has not given permission out of concern the conflict could escalate. ""The Ukrainians are pretty disappointed with Biden,"" said Edward Lucas, a senior adviser at the Center for European Policy Analysis. ""Biden's dithering has a price, paid in the destruction of Ukrainian infrastructure and the slaughter of Ukrainian civilians, and in unnecessary battlefield casualties. ""So although Trump might be worse"" a continuation of the Biden line is already pretty grim."" Several senior US Democrats have quickly lined up to support Harris as the nominee. On foreign policy, her public statements have unsurprisingly been in lockstep with Biden's. She told an audience at the Munich Security Conference in February that ""President Joe Biden and I stand with Ukraine"" and pledged the administration would ""work to secure critical weapons and resources that Ukraine so badly needs."" Heather Hurlburt, a former Biden administration official now with the Chatham House think tank, said Harris had been ""very front and center in the Ukraine policy,"" and would likely keep to the same course as Biden. In Moscow, officials suggested Biden's departure would not deter them from their goals in the war and offered no opinion on whether it would make a difference to icy Russia-US relations though Trump and President Vladimir Putin have traded praise over the years. ""It's not our business to assess the US president's decisions,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. ""This is something the US voters should be concerned about."" Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Russia's Security Council said on the Telegram messaging app that Biden's departure wouldn't change Russia's strategy in Ukraine. ""The goals of the special military operation will be achieved,"" he added, using the Kremlin's term for the war. Ukraine and America's other allies also worry the US could grow less dependable regardless of who wins. With a divided electorate and Congress, the next president could easily become consumed by domestic challenges before even reckoning with multiple flashpoints around the world. Gridlock in Congress that stalled a USD 61 billion package of military aid to Ukraine for months before it was finally approved brought home the precariousness of the situation. In Kyiv, Ukrainians absorbed the latest twist in a US election that may determine their country's future. ""I love Biden because he supported Ukraine,"" said Mykyta Kolesnikov, who manages a car wash business. ""He sent us important assistance for the war when we needed it."" But Kolesnikov, 21, said he understood that Biden had to step aside and just hoped the Democrats would field a stronger candidate. ""Zelenskyy says that he can work with Trump, but it will be very hard for Ukraine to work with Trump and his team,"" Kolesnikov said.

Harris' first full day of campaigning saw endorsements from prominent governors including Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, as well as leaders from Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a potential pick for Harris's running mate, also pledged his support. With Biden’s endorsement, Harris is positioned to unite the party and could potentially secure the nomination as early as August 1.

The July 13 incident saw 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks open fire on Trump with an AR-style rifle during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Crooks, who acted alone, was shot dead by a Secret Service sniper shortly after firing the first of eight shots. The attack wounded Trump in the ear, killed a 50-year-old firefighter, and seriously injured two rally attendees. Cheatle described the event as ""the most significant operational failure of the Secret Service in decades"" and faced bipartisan pressure, including calls for her resignation from Republican committee chairman James Comer.

Air India CEO Campbell Wilson said he expected the international market to moderate for the next six months, while the CEO of BA-owner IAG ICAG.L, Luis Gallego, said business travel was still recovering from the COVID crisis when travel almost ground to a halt with borders shut and planes grounded. COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. The comments come after Ryanair RYA.Ireported earlier on Monday a bigger than expected drop in quarterly profit as fares plunged 15%, with management saying that ticket prices were continuing to deteriorate. Some European airlines reported weaker than expected first quarter results, with their cost struggles set to carry over into second quarter results too. LufthansaLHAG.DE cut its profit target for the second time this year earlier this month. Gallego said demand was still strong for flights within Europe, but yields were under pressure, which was reflected in the Ryanair results. SUPPLY CHAIN WOES The executives lamented ongoing delivery delays from planemakers Airbus AIR.PA and Boeing BA.N, as well as supply chain constraints. Production slots at the two dominant planemakers are sold out for many years, resulting in long wait times for airlines wishing to replace and grow their fleets. For Pegasus, which has laid out an ambitious growth trajectory but said it would not sign any plane orders at the air show this week, Ozturk said better coordination and communication with Airbus on delays would help with planning. ""Even a two, three week (delay) for a July aircraft is so critical for an airline, and they (Airbus) have to overcome this in a way, optimise the processes,"" Ozturk said. In India, there's so much appetite for growth that Air India is robbing its own aircrafts for parts to keep other planes flying. ""We have 30 aircraft on the ground for want of spare parts,"" Wilson said, adding that he expected plane delivery delays to last a ""good couple of years.""

Maldives seeks China's fiscal support to carry out economic reforms to address debt distress,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/maldives-seeks-chinas-fiscal-support-to-carry-out-economic-reforms-to-address-debt-distress-12775123.html,World,"July 22, 2024 06:44 PM","Maldives Foreign Minister Moosa Zameer on Monday met his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi and sought Beijing's support to carry out fiscal and economic reforms to develop its debt-ridden economy. Zameer met Wang and briefed him on the economic and fiscal situation in the Maldives, emphasising the importance of carrying out diligently, the fiscal reforms as announced by Maldivian President Muhammad Muizzu, a press release issued by the Maldives Foreign Ministry said. Zameer also requested China's support in carrying out the reform programme that will foster consumer and investor confidence in the Maldivian economy, thereby positively impacting the island nation's economic resilience. Zameer and Wang held extensive bilateral discussions, the press release said. Wang reaffirmed Beijing's commitment to further strengthen the historic and friendly relations between the two countries. Zameer thanked China for its substantial support through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which has played a pivotal role in the Maldives' socio-economic development, it said. The meeting concluded with both parties reiterating their commitment to exploring new avenues for cooperation, the release said. China has scaled up its relations with Maldives, since Muzzu, widely regarded as a pro-Beijing leader, took over power last year. During Muizzu's visit to Beijing, the two countries elevated their ties to a comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership and signed 20 agreements. Since then Maldives permitted Chinaâ's ocean research vessels, widely regarded as spy ships to berth in its waters much to the concern of India. In May, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned the Maldives that it faces a high risk of debt distress without significant policy changes. The IMF noted that the Maldives' current account deficit is expected to remain large and that its overall fiscal deficits and public debt are projected to stay elevated. Subsequently, the Muizzu government sought restructuring of loans from China. The Maldives' debt to China reportedly amounted to over USD 1.3 billion. In the same month, Chinese Ambassador to the Maldives Wang Lixin said discussions are being held between the two countries on providing some form of ease in debt repayment on the loans currently taken from China by the Maldives government. She, however, maintained that debt restructuring is not the solution, as doing so would obstruct the Maldives from seeking further financial aid from China, the Maldives media reported. Wang stated that China, too, is deeply concerned about the rising debt of Maldives, adding that their policy is to move forward in a manner that would not further add to this debt. ""You also would have noticed that now, China is issuing grants to the Maldives. We are prioritising providing free aid to the Maldives, so as not to further increase Maldives' debt,"" she said.

Gabbard’s remarks come in the wake of US President Joe Biden’s announcement that he will not seek re-election in November and his endorsement of Harris as the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee. In addition to her criticism of Harris, Gabbard urged Americans to vote for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. ""Biden's out, Kamala is in. Don't be fooled: policies won't change. Just like Biden wasn't the one calling the shots, Kamala Harris won't be either,"" the 43-year-old independent politician said in a video post. ""She is the new figurehead for the deep state and the maidservant of Hillary Clinton, queen of the cabal of warmongers. They will continue their efforts to engulf the world in war and take away our liberty,"" Gabbard said in a video post soon after Biden endorsed Harris as the Democratic Party's presidential candidate. Gabbard landed in Rome to attend a dialogue and forum on peace, security, and prosperity for the Western Hemisphere in Europe, when she saw the news flash that Biden's no longer running for reelection. ""I'm going to sound the same warning now that I have been for years, going all the way back to 2020, when both Kamala and I were running for president on the Democratic ticket. She is unfit and unqualified to be our president and commander in chief and would be incredibly dangerous in that position,"" Gabbard alleged. Gabbard was a candidate for the Democratic nomination in the presidential election in 2020, before announcing in October 2022 that she had quit the Democratic Party to become an independent. ""The prospect of Kamala Harris making decisions about war and peace and where to send my brothers and sisters in uniform into harm's way is not only terrifying to us, it should be terrifying to every American knowing that we would all pay the price for her dangerous actions and dangerous decisions,"" she said.Biden’s out, Kamala is in.

The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) did not provide details on the arrangement for the Philippines' resupply missions to the Sierra Madre on the Second Thomas Shoal. But it said it followed ""frank and constructive discussions"" between the two sides at the Bilateral Consultation Mechanism earlier this month. ""Both sides continue to recognize the need to de-escalate the situation in the South China Sea and manage differences through dialogue and consultation and agree that the agreement will not prejudice each other's positions in the South China Sea,"" the DFA said. The Chinese foreign ministry confirmed the ""temporary arrangement"" with the two sides agreeing to jointly manage maritime differences and de-escalate the situation in the South China Sea. ""The Chinese side still demands that the Philippine side tow away the ship and restore the original status of (Second Thomas Shoal) as if it were unmanned and without facilities,"" a spokesperson said in a statement released early on Monday. Manila deliberately beached the Philippine naval ship in 1999 to reinforce its claims over disputed waters around the shoal and it has since maintained a small contingent of sailors. ""If the Philippines needs to provide supplies to the ship's occupants before the Philippines tows away the beached warship, the Chinese side is willing to allow the Philippine side to carry out the transportation and replenishment on humanitarian grounds,"" the spokesperson said. China still stood firm over its territorial claims regarding the disputed waters. ""If the Philippines transports a large amount of building materials to the ship and tries to build fixed facilities and permanent outposts, China will never accept it and will resolutely block it in accordance with laws and regulations, so as to safeguard China's sovereignty,"" the spokesperson added. PHILIPPINES ONLY OPERATION Philippine security officials also said on Sunday they will carry out the resupply missions on their own despite an offer from the United States for help. White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on Friday the U.S. ""will do what is necessary"" to ensure its treaty ally can resupply the Sierra Madre on the Second Thomas Shoal. Sullivan's Filipino counterpart, Eduardo Ano, said the resupply will remain ""a pure Philippine operation"". ""There is no need at this time for any direct involvement of U.S. forces in RORE (resupply) mission,"" Ano said in a statement. Reuters previously reported that the Philippines turned down offers from the U.S. to assist its operations in the South China Sea. Tensions in the disputed waterway have boiled over into violence in the past year, with a Filipino soldier losing a finger last month in a clash that Manila described as an ""intentional-high speed ramming"" by the China Coast Guard. The Philippine military's spokesperson said in a separate statement on Sunday the Philippines ""will exhaust all means before seeking foreign intervention"" in its resupply missions. Manila and Washington are bound by the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty, a pact that can be invoked in case of an armed attack against Philippine forces, public vessels or aircraft in the South China Sea. U.S. officials including President Joe Biden have affirmed its ""ironclad"" commitment to aid the Philippines. China claims nearly all of the South China Sea, overlapping maritime claims of the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei. In 2016, a Hague-based tribunal said China's claims had no legal basis, a decision Beijing has rejected.

Musk also expressed frustration, stating, “Authorities keep saying it will get better, but it doesn’t. Last week was the worst experience ever.

China to allow delayed retirement to combat population woes,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/china-to-allow-delayed-retirement-to-combat-population-woes-12774564.html,World,"July 22, 2024 01:31 PM","China will gradually raise its statutory retirement age, now among the world's lowest, to allow people to work longer, as it struggles to relieve soaring pressure on pension budgets, with many provinces already facing deficits. The reform is urgent with life expectancy having risen in China to 78 years by 2021, from about 44 years in 1960, outstripping the United States, and projected to exceed 80 years by 2050. Sunday's announcement came in a key policy document that also rolled out plans to sharpen a strategy to combat a declining birth rate and an ageing population that fell for a second straight year in 2023, and is seen falling for decades. ""In line with the principle of voluntary participation with appropriate flexibility, we will advance reform to gradually raise the statutory retirement age in a prudent and orderly manner,"" the authorities said. The reforms outlined in the document are envisaged to be completed by 2029, they added. The retirement age is now 60 for men, or five to six years below that in most developed economies, while for women in white-collar work it is 55, and 50 for women who work in factories. Policymakers had said during the last two years they aimed to raise the age of retirement, but the change will be the first time that workers are able to choose to continue working. National health authorities expect the cohort of those aged 60 and older to rise from 280 million to more than 400 million by 2035, or the equivalent of the entire current populations of Britain and the United States combined.

Clashes between protesters and security forces killed at least 139 people across the South Asian nation after the high court last month reinstated job reservations removed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government in 2018. On Sunday, however, the Supreme Court ordered that 93% of government jobs should be allocated on the basis of merit, against earlier quotas of 56% for groups such as families of freedom fighters, women, and people from underdeveloped areas. There were no reports of violence or protests on Monday morning and media said curfew would be relaxed for three hours in the afternoon, extended from two hours the previous day, so that people could buy essentials. Student protesters have said they plan to continue demonstrations, however, until the release of detained protest leaders, and have demanded the government lift the curfew and re-open universities shut since Wednesday. They have set a 48-hour deadline for the government to act on the demands. Last week's protests saw thousands injured as security forces fired tear gas, rubber bullets, and sound grenades to scatter the demonstrators. Experts have blamed the unrest on stagnant job growth in the private sector and high rates of youth unemployment that have made government jobs, with their regular wage hikes and other privileges, more attractive.

Renault CEO Luca De Meo calls for flexibility in European EV transition timeline,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/renault-ceo-luca-de-meo-calls-for-flexibility-in-european-ev-transition-timeline-12774359.html,World,"July 22, 2024 11:11 AM","Renault's CEO Luca De Meo expressed doubts over the timeline for transitioning to electric vehicles in Europe, adding the carmaker has to bring down costs if it wants to deliver on its EV goals, in comments to business daily Les Echos published on Monday. WHY IT'S IMPORTANT The transition to electric vehicles plays a crucial role in reducing global carbon emissions, and the pace at which this shift occurs will reshape automotive industry and the environment. Recent EU elections, coming at a time of weak electric vehicle demand, saw more and more calls to scrap the EU's 2035 ban on sales of diesel and petrol cars, which is due to be reviewed in 2026. KEY QUOTE(S) ""We need a little more flexibility in the schedule,"" De Meo, who also chairs European car lobby group ACEA, said, but added: ""However, it would be a serious strategic error to purely and simply abandon the objective because of the current market slowdown."" Asked about Renault's ambitions to shift 100% of its European car production to electric vehicles in the context of a weak domestic market, De Meo said: ""The truth is we are not yet on the right trajectory to achieve 100% electric cars by 2035. That's the truth. If customers don't follow us, we're all responsible. We need to cut costs."" CONTEXT The automotive sector has experienced various challenges, such as regulatory uncertainty and competition from China adding to a cost-of-living crisis in home markets, impacting the transition to electric vehicles. Global EV sales rose by 35% in 2023 but fell in 2024. In June, however, new car sales in the European Union rose 4.3% in June to their highest since July 2019, while registrations of battery electric cars fell marginally.

Harris, who received Biden's support to become the next Democratic presidential nominee after he withdrew from the race for the White House, is set to become the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead the ticket of a major American political party. Harris, 59, said she was ""honoured"" to receive Biden's endorsement and intends to ""earn and win"" the nomination of the Democratic Party. ""I am honoured to have the President's endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,"" she said in a statement. The historic endorsement came after Biden, 81, announced Sunday that he is dropping out of the race following weeks of disarray within the Democratic Party. Biden's disastrous first presidential debate with his Republican rival and former president Trump called into question his ability to win a second term and govern for another four years. Despite Biden's backing, it remains unclear whether Harris will become the nominee, or what process the Democratic Party would take to select an alternative. Democratic National Committee chairman Jaime Harrison said in a statement that in the coming days, the party will ""undertake a transparent and orderly process to move forward as a united Democratic Party with a candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in November."" Though Biden's endorsement almost seals her position as the presidential nominee of her party, Harris still needs to get elected by the party's delegates during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month. Biden has won 3,896 delegates as against 1,976 required to win the party's presidential nomination. In a move that would give her access to the campaign funds, the Biden-Harris campaign amended filings with the Federal Election Commission to rename its principal committee and declare Harris a candidate for president. ""I am honoured to have the President's endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,"" said Harris, who has been serving as the US' first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president since 2021. Harris immediately secured the endorsement of former president Bill Clinton, thus making it a bit easier for her to win the delegate battle during the Democratic National Convention beginning on August 19. ""On behalf of the American people, I thank Joe Biden for his extraordinary leadership as President of the United States and for his decades of service to our country,"" she said. Harris said over the past year, she has travelled across the country, talking to Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election. ""And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead. I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party -- and unite our nation-- to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda... We have 107 days until Election Day. Together, we will fight. And together, we will win,"" she said. Meanwhile, the ""overwhelming majority"" of state Democratic Party chairs have announced their support for Vice President Harris as their nominee for president, the Association of State Democratic Committees (ASDC) said in a statement on Sunday. ""I am proud that state party chairs, vice-chairs, and executive directors across the country are overwhelmingly uniting behind Vice President Kamala Harris,"" ASDC President Ken Martin said in a statement. Bill Clinton and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton quickly endorsed Harris to be the nominee. ""We've lived through many ups and downs, but nothing has made us more worried for our country than the threat posed by a second Trump term,"" they said in a joint statement. ""He has promised to be a dictator on day one, and the recent ruling by his servile Supreme Court will only embolden him to further shred the Constitution. Now is the time to support Kamala Harris and fight with everything we've got to elect her,"" the Clintons said. However, former president Barack Obama and ex-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have not yet endorsed Harris as the Democratic Party's nominee for the November 5 general elections. ""We will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead. But I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,"" Obama said in a statement.

However, Khosla, an OpenAI investor and Democratic donor, called for an ""open convention"" to select a more moderate candidate. He suggested Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro as alternatives to Harris. According to him, the US needed a president who neither swings to the far-right nor is too woke.

Nvidia preparing version of new flaghip AI chip for Chinese market: Report,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/nvidia-preparing-version-of-new-flaghip-ai-chip-for-chinese-market-report-12774256.html,World,"July 22, 2024 09:40 AM","Nvidia is working on a version of its new flagship AI chips for the China market that would be compatible with current U.S. export controls, three sources familiar with the matter said. The AI chip giant in March unveiled its ""Blackwell"" chip series, which is due to be mass produced later in the year. Within that series, the B200 is 30 times speedier than its predecessor at some tasks like serving up answers from chatbots. Nvidia will work with Inspur, one of its major distributor partners in China, on the launch and distribution of the chip which is tentatively named the ""B20"", two of the sources said.Â The sources declined to be identified as Nvidia has yet to make a public announcement. A spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment. Inspur did not respond to requests for comment. Washington tightened its controls on exports of cutting-edge semiconductors to China in 2023, seeking to prevent breakthroughs in supercomputing that would aid China's military. Since then, Nvidia has developed three chips tailored specifically for the Chinese market.

India must play peacemaker in bloodied Bangladesh ,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/india-must-play-peacemaker-in-bloodied-bangladesh-12774075.html,World,"July 22, 2024 08:24 AM","Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government can’t wash its hands of the bloodbath in Bangladesh – more than a 140 agitating young men have been already killed in the anti-quota protests rocking our neighbour – because India has a far bigger stake in Bangladesh than any other country in the whole world. Any upheaval there -- whether it leads to regime change or eventually dissipates – has grave implications for our national security. It’s therefore in our own strategic interests to sort out the mess on a war footing and restore normalcy there at any cost. It’s perfectly okay to take an official stand that the deadly turmoil in Bangladesh is its internal matter, advice Indian nationals there to steer clear of trouble and evacuate them if necessary, as our External Affairs Ministry has done in the circumstances. But India mustn’t stop at that because it is the resident power with onerous duties and responsibilities that it can shirk only at its own cost. As things stand today, New Delhi can’t afford to dither or look away. It has no option but to take charge as an elder brother, if not ‘big brother’, in its zone of influence. Hasina’s cancelled foreign trips indicate a big problem The volatility can be gauged from the fact that Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who had to cut short her state visit to China last week and return home to quell the violent protests by university students against job quotas which gathered momentum in her absence, has now been compelled to cancel her tour of Spain and Brazil to handle the increasingly dangerous state of affairs. An indefinite national curfew and shoot-on-sight order is in force, the army, paramilitary, tanks and armoured carriers are patrolling the streets, mobile internet and broadband service is shut down and all trains have been cancelled by Hasina’s Awami League administration, turning the densely populated Muslim nation at our doorstep into a ticking time bomb. Fake news for sympathy Notably, even as Bangladesh burned, mid-week there were reports of opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party leaders being closeted in the Chinese embassy in Dhaka with Beijing’s diplomats, who were joined by the Pakistani High Commissioner making it a threesome! These patently untrue stories were obviously planted in the media by Hasina’s government to gain India’s sympathies by characterising the skyrocketing turmoil as the handiwork of colluding anti-India BNP, Pakistani and Chinese saboteurs. Fortunately, New Delhi - which thoroughly monitors its backyard - has seen through all these canards. It is treating with equal disdain fabricated reports of anti-quota protestors demanding termination of India’s access to railways, roads and rivers in their country as one of the pre-conditions to call of their agitation. On Sunday, the Supreme Court scaled back the job quotas but hasn’t altogether abolished the highly discriminatory government job reservations which blatantly favour the Awami League and triggered the students’ rebellion. The judicial intervention is unlikely to restore normalcy immediately given the high number of casualties and brutalities inflicted by the army-police at Hasina’s behest which has created a chasm between the regime and ordinary Bangladeshis. India needs to counsel restraint In such a foreboding scenario, India’s task is cut out. Without wasting any time, New Delhi must counsel Hasina to control her temper and tongue after all the damage her loose talk, especially the abusive-derogatory term “Razakar”, has done. At the age of 76 and a four-term PM, she should speak like a grandmother-cum-elder statesman and not a rabble rouser hurtling the country into chaos and anarchy. Secondly, New Delhi must become the bridge between the Hasina government and protestors’ leaders so that the two sides sit across the table at the earliest. To put it bluntly, India’s mediation is the need of the hour in Bangladesh. Although India is known to be pro-Hasina, no one in Bangladesh is going to rebuff India if it comes forward as a peacemaker. Ukraine is very far away. Let’s start from our backyard where our standing is at an all-time high. India is the best third-party to end the spiral of violence and usher in peace after all the unnecessary bloodletting of the last few days. Hands-off policy is not realisitic Bangladesh is far too important for India to pursue a hands-off policy at this critical juncture. Let’s not forget that it is not just another neighbouring country like Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan or Sri Lanka – it’s a lot more than that. Geographically, Bangladesh is well and truly embedded “inside” India. Save for a short boundary with Myanmar and the waters of the Bay of Bengal in the south, Bangladesh is surrounded by as many as five Indian states – West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram – on all sides. In that sense, Bangladesh is indeed “inside” India – and therefore far more important than a neighbour in the traditional sense. Bangladesh’s domestic politics and governance naturally impact India more than any other country in the world. A Bangladesh on the boil would be disastrous for India’s restive northeast. So the faster we act, the better for us and our dear neighbour.

Trump claimed that ""everybody around Biden, including his doctors, knew that he was not capable of running for or being president."" Biden's unexpected decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race came on Sunday, accompanied by an endorsement for Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party's new nominee. This move followed weeks of intense pressure from Democrats after Biden's poor performance in a debate against Trump. Trump, using his social media platform ""Truth Social,"" suggested that Biden might not be suffering from COVID-19, as previously reported. “So we are forced to spend time and money on fighting Crooked Joe Biden, he polls badly after having a terrible debate, and quits the race. Now we have to start all over again,” Trump posted. The former president went on to question whether the Republican Party should be reimbursed for what he called ""fraud,"" suggesting that those close to Biden knew he was incapable of serving as president. “Crooked Joe just got knocked out, so now I'll have to do it a FOURTH TIME!!!” he exclaimed. Trump criticized the decision to hold the debate on ABC, advocating instead for Fox News. “Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on Fox News, rather than very biased ABC. Thank you!” he posted. In another post, Trump expressed doubt about Biden’s COVID-19 diagnosis. “Does anybody really believe that Crooked Joe had Covid? No, he wanted to get out ever since June 27, the night of the debate where he was completely obliterated.” Biden, who tested positive for COVID-19 on July 17, paused his campaign at a critical moment, returning to Delaware to isolate. Trump claimed this was an excuse to exit the race after his poor debate performance. “That was the big moment in Joe Biden's demise. That was the point in time when Joe was revealed for what he is, an incompetent man who should never have been President. Joe Biden is not fit to serve - He is destroying our Country!” Trump further criticized Biden's presidency, blaming him for issues ranging from border security to national and international standing. “Crooked Joe Biden is the worst president, by far, in the history of our nation. He has done everything possible to destroy our country, from our southern border to energy dominance, national security, international standing, and so much more,” Trump said. He accused Biden's team of misleading Americans about the president's health and capabilities. “He was annihilated in an earth-shattering debate and now the corrupt and radical Democrats are throwing him overboard. He was not fit to serve from the very beginning, but the people around him lied to America about his complete and total mental, physical, and cognitive demise. Whoever the Left puts up now will just be more of the same. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” In closing, Trump reiterated his belief that Biden's presidency has caused significant harm to the country, but expressed confidence that this damage could be quickly remedied. “He only attained the position of President by lies, fake news, and not leaving his basement... Look what he has done to our country, with millions of people coming across our border totally unchecked and unvetted, many from prisons, mental institutions, and record numbers of terrorists. We will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly,” Trump concluded. (With inputs from PTI) ",NEGATIVE
Crypto traders bullish as Joe Biden bows out of US presidential race,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/crypto-traders-bullish-as-joe-biden-bows-out-of-us-presidential-race-12774146.html,World,"July 22, 2024 07:27 AM","Bitcoin edged up to the highest level in over a month as traders evaluated the implications of US President Joe Biden’s decision to abandon his reelection bid. The largest digital asset recovered from earlier losses to hover around $68,300 as of 8:42 a.m. in Singapore on Monday as markets reacted to the possibility of a match-up between pro-crypto Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. The move higher is a “reflection in the market’s eyes that the Democrats under Kamala Harris cannot overtake Trump in the race for the White House and that a new dawn is emerging for Bitcoin under a pro-crypto US President,” said Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG Australia Pty.  “We expect the market to become a lot more investible under a Trump administration,” Benjamin Celermajer, co-chief investment officer at Magnet Capital, told Bloomberg News. He said he expected that tokens with “real value drivers” would perform well, citing as examples the coins linked to the Maker, Aave and Lido protocols. Trump, who has taken a notably pro-crypto turn over the last several months, is scheduled to speak at a major Bitcoin conference in Nashville on July 27. The Republican presidential candidate will also host a fundraiser on the heels of the conference, for which prospective attendees have been asked to contribute $844,600 per seat. By contrast, “what we don’t yet know is Harris’ views on crypto,” said Caroline Bowler, CEO of BTC Markets. “On something like crypto where it could end up being a make or break election subject for either of the candidates, we could see some more insights into her views in the coming weeks.” Over on X, where Elon Musk sported an avatar featuring the laser eyes often considered to be a signifier of Bitcoin enthusiasm, popular crypto accounts celebrated the burgeoning rally. Teong Hng, chief executive at crypto investment firm Satori Research, said activity in the over-the-counter options market suggested Bitcoin might revisit its all-time highs soon. Rising interest in December 2024 calls with a strike price of $100,000 suggest institutional investors are becoming more bullish. Hng said he was “expecting a strong year-end rally punctuated by a Trump win.” Bitcoin’s relatively strong performance over the past week, as calls for Biden to withdraw increased in both frequency and intensity, diverged from the weakness in stocks. Further, the “underlying momentum” behind recent inflows into Bitcoin-backed exchange-traded funds suggests we could see another tilt at $70,000,” Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Group, wrote in a note.

In a joint statement on behalf of the Trump Campaign, Chris LaCivita and Susie Wilesoe alleged that Biden is a ""national security threat in great cognitive decline and a clear and present danger to every man, woman and child in our country"". ""The question then to Kamala Harris is simple: knowing that Joe Biden withdrew from the campaign because of his rapidly deteriorating condition, does Harris believe the people of America are safe and secure with Joe Biden in the White House for six more months?"" it posed.

It alleged that Biden was a ""complete fraud and a disgrace to our country"".' ""Biden has left our borders wide open, allowing up to 20 million illegal aliens to enter the United States, creating a Biden Migrant Crime Wave and taxing precious resources.

MARK KELLY, U.S. SENATOR, ARIZONA U.S. Senator Mark Kelly is well liked among Democratic Party elites for striking a relatively moderate tone in a hotly contested state that traditionally has favored Republicans, but which Biden won in 2020. A former U.S. Navy captain and astronaut, Kelly is also the husband of former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was seriously wounded in a 2011 shooting. Gun violence is a major campaign issue for Democrats. JOSH SHAPIRO, GOVERNOR, PENNSYLVANIA Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania's governor, took office just last year but is already seen as a rising star for the party nationally. Trained as a lawyer, Shapiro served as the state's attorney general, a legal background that is similar to Harris' own as a prosecutor. He has a long history of winning elections against Republicans in a state that Democrats believe they must win to secure the election in November. J.B. PRITZKER Billionaire Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has proven a major force in the party, tapping his own financial resources linked to Hyatt Hotels to help Biden's campaign effort and to stand up the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month. While Illinois leans heavily Democratic, neighboring Wisconsin is one of the biggest prizes in the 2024 election. GRETCHEN WHITMER, GOVERNOR, MICHIGAN Governor Gretchen Whitmer has built a strong base in the closely contested state of Michigan, running on a platform of straight talk and kitchen-table issues. She attracted Biden's attention in 2020, being vetted as a possible running mate before Biden picked Harris. She was a top supporter of and spokesperson for Biden's reelection bid. A Harris-Whitmer ticket would be the first all-woman ticket for a major U.S. political party - a potential bonus in an election where women's reproductive rights are a top issue.

Explainer: US Vice President Kamala Harris' views on business issues,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/explainer-us-vice-president-kamala-harris-views-on-business-issues-12774129.html,World,"July 22, 2024 06:29 AM","U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is potentially poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee in the November election. Here are her views and actions related to some key business topics. TECH REGULATION As California attorney general, Harris sued eBay in 2012, alleging anticompetitive hiring practices surrounding a no-poaching agreement with Intuit that led to a nearly $4 million settlement in 2014. In 2015, she compelled startup Houzz to hire a chief privacy officer after allegations that the home design app had recorded sales calls without proper notification and consent. One of her signature issues was curtailing the distribution of pornography on social media, particularly ""revenge porn,"" a practice involving the posting of explicit photos without the subject's consent. She took credit for a pressure campaign that led to Facebook, Alphabet's Google, Microsoft and others taking measures to remove certain explicit images. ""I cannot emphasize enough how leaders in technology have stepped up,"" said Harris at a news conference then. ""I'm not suggesting any of them were happy to get a call from the AG saying, ""Come in, we want to talk with you."" But they all did. They did."" BIG TECH As a candidate for California attorney general, Harris reportedly assured potential donors that she was ""a capitalist."" She has generally been seen as cozy with prominent tech executives and investors, the local industry in her home Bay Area. She attended the wedding of Sean Parker, an early Facebook executive. Her brother-in-law, Tony West, is the chief legal officer for Uber. She also accepted donations from Reid Hoffman, a prominent venture capitalist and co-founder of Linkedin, as well as billionaire John Doerr and venture capitalist Ron Conway. Big tech executives also supported her, including Sheryl Sandberg, then chief operating officer of Facebook, and Marc Benioff, the billionaire CEO of Salesforce. CLIMATE AND ENERGY Harris' climate and energy positions are similar to Biden's. But throughout her career she has made clear that clean energy and environmental justice are priorities. When Biden announced Harris as his running mate in the 2020 race, he emphasized her tough stance against big oil when she served in key roles in California,Â noting lawsuits she had launched both as San Francisco's district attorney from 2004 to 2011 and then as the state's attorney general until January 2017, when she became a U.S. senator. Last year, Harris made her debut at international climate negotiations, announcing a $3 billion commitment to the Green Climate Fund and making her first major international speech focused on climate. As vice president, Harris has also been involved in Environmental Protection Agency policy rollouts that tackled long-standing environmental justice issues, such as a multibillion-dollar program to replace lead pipes and lead paint around the country. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE As vice president, Harris has been particularly outspoken on artificial intelligence. She warned against the ""existential"" threat of AI and said it could ""endanger the very existence of humanity,"" in a November 2023 address. In meeting with tech execs like Microsoft's Satya Nadella, OpenAI's Sam Altman and Alphabet's Sundar Pichai, Harris warned that they have a ""moral"" obligation to guard against AI's possible dangers. She backed an AI executive order from Biden that seeks stronger protections for consumers, singling out AI-generated scam calls and the impacts of unlabeled AI-generated content.

Donald Trump campaign switches gears to confront a Kamala Harris challenge,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/donald-trump-campaign-switches-gears-to-confront-a-kamala-harris-challenge-12774128.html,World,"July 22, 2024 06:28 AM","Donald Trump boasted on Sunday he would easily defeat Kamala Harris if she becomes the Democratic nominee in the Nov. 5 presidential election, but her entry would reshape a race that had appeared to be going Trump's way. Democratic President Joe Biden's sudden decision to exit the race and endorse Harris, his vice president, upended an election that was still reeling from the attempted assassination eight days ago of Trump, the Republican nominee. Sources told Reuters that Trump's campaign had for weeks been planning for Harris to be his opponent should she win her party's nomination. ""Harris will be easier to beat than Joe Biden would have been,"" Trump told CNN shortly after Biden's announcement. Trump's campaign has signaled it will tie her as tightly as possible to Biden's immigration policy, which Republicans say is to blame for millions of people crossing the southern border with Mexico illegally. The second line of attack will revolve around the economy. Public opinion polls consistently show Americans are unhappy with high food and fuel costs as well as interest rates that have made buying a home less affordable. ""She's the co-pilot of the Biden vision,"" said one Trump adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity during last week's Republican National Convention, where a unified party anointed Trump as its nominee in the White House race. ""If they want to switch to Biden 2.0 and have 'Cackling' Kamala at the top of the ticket, we're good either way,"" the adviser said, repeating an insult the campaign has been trying out for weeks focused on how the vice president laughs. Make America Great Again Inc, a super PAC backing Trump, said on Sunday it was pulling anti-Biden television ads that had been set to run in the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania and replacing them with an ad attacking Harris. The 30-second ad accuses Harris of hiding Biden's infirmity from the public, and it seeks to pin the administration's record solely on her. ""Kamala knew Joe couldn't do the job, so she did it. Look what she got done: a border invasion, runaway inflation, the American Dream dead,"" the narrator says. Trump, known for using insulting and sometimes offensive language to attack his opponents, gave supporters at a rally in Michigan on Saturday a taste of the insults he is likely to fling at Harris in the coming days. ""I call her laughing Kamala. You ever watch a laugh? She's crazy. You can tell a lot by a laugh. She's crazy. She's nuts,"" he said. ALTERED RACE The Democratic Party has yet to determine how to move forward, and there is as yet no guarantee that Harris will emerge as the party's nominee despite Biden's endorsement. Harris as the Democratic nominee would alter the race in perhaps unforeseen ways, political strategists said. A 59-year-old woman who is Black and Asian-American would fashion an entirely new dynamic with Trump, 78, offering a vivid generational and cultural split-screen. The United States has yet to elect a woman president in its 248-year history. Rodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist and longtime congressional aide, said Harris would be able to mount ""a more energetic campaign with excitement from younger voters and people of color"" after Biden struggled to energize these important Democratic Party voting blocs. A former prosecutor and California attorney general as well as a former U.S. senator, Harris would be able to use ""her years of litigation experience to effectively prosecute Trump in the court of public opinion,"" Mollineau said. Chip Felkel, a Republican strategist, cautioned that it would be a mistake for the Trump campaign to assume Harris could serve as a simple stand-in for Biden, because of her potential appeal to different parts of the electorate. Recent polls have shown Harris to be competitive with Trump. In a hypothetical head-to-head matchup, Harris and Trump were tied with 44% support each in a July 15-16 Reuters/Ipsos poll. Before Sunday, the Trump campaign had already begun discussions about how they would redeploy campaign resources should Biden drop out of the race, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter. Jeanette Hoffman, a Republican political consultant, said despite the contrasts Harris would bring to the ticket, her close ties to Biden would be a drag on her candidacy. Harris ""doesn't represent the change America is looking for,"" Hoffman said. MAGA Inc CEO Taylor Budowich said his group has commissioned opposition research on several possible Democratic candidates. ""MAGA Inc is prepared for all outcomes of a Democrat Party who has only brought chaos and failure,"" he said.

The People's Bank of China said it would cut the seven-day reverse repo rate to 1.7% from 1.8%, and would also improve the mechanism of open market operations. Chinese bond yields fell across the board after the rate cut announcement. The rate cut is aimed at ""strengthening counter-cyclical adjustments to better support the real economy,"" the PBOC said in a statement. ""The rate cut is one step in the right direction. I expect more rate cuts to come after the Fed enters a rate cut cycle,"" said Zhang Zhiwei, president and chief economist of Pinpoint Asset Management. ""The fact that PBOC didn’t wait for the Fed to cut first indicates that the government recognises the downward pressure on China’s economy."" The announcement comes after the PBOC said it would revamp its monetary policy transmission channel.

Trump posted on Truth Social: “Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve—and never was!

I know none of this could have been done without you, the American people. Together, we overcame a once in a century pandemic and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. We've protected and preserved our Democracy. And we've revitalized and strengthened our alliances around the world. It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term. I will speak to the Nation later this week in more detail about my decision. For now, let me express my deepest gratitude to all those who have worked so hard to see me reelected. I want to thank Vice President Kamala Harris for being an extraordinary partner in all this work.

Can Kamala Harris achieve what no woman has in US history?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/can-kamala-harris-achieve-what-no-woman-has-in-us-history-12774100.html,World,"July 22, 2024 12:50 AM","With US President Joe Biden announcing that he will end his candidacy for re-election in 2024 and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party's new nominee, saying ""It is in the best interest of my party and the country"", all focus now shift on Kamala Harris who will look to create a record but under difficult circumstances. If elected, Harris would break one of the highest glass ceilings left for women in the United States -- that of occupying the country's top office. Her husband, Douglas Emhoff, would also be breaking new ground, moving from being the current Second Gentleman to the country's first First Gentleman. Kamala Harris was born in Oakland, California. As the daughter of immigrants, she grew up surrounded by a diverse community and a loving extended family. She and her sister, Maya, were inspired by their mother, Shyamala Gopalan, a breast cancer scientist and pioneer in her own right who came to the United States from India at the age of 19 and then received her doctorate the same year that Kamala was born. However, Kamala Harris long struggled with approval ratings as bad or worse than President Joe Biden's, according to reports. And with Biden's endorsement of Harris after stunning the world by dropping his own reelection bid Sunday, she's suddenly on the cusp of history. In more than two centuries of democracy, American voters have elected only one Black president and never a woman, a record that makes even some Black voters wonder if Harris can crash through the hardest ceiling in US politics. Harris will hope she has done the hard work to earn her full party's backing amid the crisis. Kamala Harris has won plaudits in party circles by staying loyal to the 81-year-old president during the last few weeks, even as political vultures circled over his candidacy. Kamala Harris who will face Trump -- a brutal battle against a candidate who defeated Hillary Clinton in her bid become the first female commander-in-chief in 2016. The fact that Harris has blamed much of the criticism of her by Republicans on racism and sexism would likely make a win feel even more vindicating for her. A child of immigrant parents -- her father was from Jamaica and her mother from India -- Harris grew up in Oakland, California, in an activist household that saw her attend her first rallies in a stroller. Harris told the Wall Street Journal in February: ""I am ready to serve. There's no question about that."" Challenges before Kamala Harris Kamala Harris will have barely three months to campaign and unite the party and donors behind her. But many Democrats are excited about her chances. Harris, 59, is two decades younger than Trump and a leader in the party on abortion rights, an issue which resonates with younger voters and Democrats' progressive base. Proponents argue she would energize those voters, consolidate Black support, and bring sharp debating skills to prosecute the political case against the former president. According to Reuters, Harris's approval ratings, while low, are a tick higher than Biden's. According to polling outfit Five Thirty Eight, 38.6 percent of Americans approve of Harris while 50.4 percent disapprove. Biden has 38.5 percent approval and 56.2 percent disapproval. ""If you think that there is consensus among the people who want Joe Biden to leave that they will support Kamala - Vice President Harris - you would be mistaken,"" Representative Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, a Biden supporter, said on Instagram. ""There's no safe option."" Supporters of Harris, the first woman and first Black and South Asian person to serve as vice president, argue she has already weathered unfair attacks related to her race and gender and is prepared for more. ""America has a history of racism, sexism, so I'm sure that will factor into this conversation, factor into her campaign,"" said Jamal Simmons, a former Harris aide. But he said there is a flip side: Black voters could be galvanized if Harris is put at the top of the ticket, and women, including some who regret not voting for Clinton in 2016, would back her as well. ""It's also true that she will benefit from her race and her gender, that many African Americans may rally to her candidacy,"" he said. Harris benefits from greater name recognition than the other Democratic leaders who have been floated as potential presidential candidates, he said. California Governor Gavin Newsom and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer are among those talked about in Democratic circles as possible replacements. ""While she has flaws and faults like everyone, we know those flaws and faults, so you can build a campaign with clarity. Any other candidates are complete unknowns,"" Simmons said. One former Democratic lawmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he thought Harris was a bigger risk because of her record than her race. Harris was plagued by staff turnover at the beginning of her vice presidency and showed little progress on her portfolios of protecting voting rights and stemming migration from Central America. ""I think the race thing is just a compounding factor or an exacerbating factor,"" the former lawmaker said. ""Any of it's going to be a gamble, but I like the odds with another candidate, even if that means Kamala at the top of the ticket."" *With Inputs from Reuters, AFP

He witnessed great shifts in the nation’s culture and identity, from the height of its post-Cold War strength to a nation in conflict with itself. At 81, with over 50 years in national politics, Biden was reluctant to pass on the torch, believing his years of experience mattered above all else. “I have acquired a hell of a lot of wisdom and know more than the vast majority of people,” he said in an interview last year when questions about his age were becoming harder to ignore. However, this long view often blinded him to how much both the world and his country had changed. In his final year, this showed in his handling of the Gaza conflict, influenced by an outdated perception of Israel. It also showed in his belief that he could restore normalcy after Donald Trump’s presidency, when the national mood had fundamentally shifted. Furthermore, he failed to notice his dwindling support within his own party in recent months. According to an article in The Independent, Biden’s experience was a superpower for much of his career and the beginning of his first term. He effectively used it to pass significant legislation, even with a razor-thin majority in Congress. His administration passed a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus package, a bipartisan infrastructure bill, sweeping climate and healthcare reforms, and the CHIPS and Science Act to boost semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. On the international stage, Biden reacted swiftly to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, revitalizing NATO and providing substantial support to Ukraine. Biden's politics were also deeply influenced by personal tragedy. After a car accident killed his first wife and daughter, he became known for his daily Amtrak commutes to be with his sons. This empathy allowed him to connect with people from all walks of life, often staying after events to share personal stories. Biden's ambition was evident throughout his career, always seeking middle ground between Democrats and Republicans. However, this centrist approach left him with a voting record difficult to defend in the 2020 presidential race. Despite setbacks, including failed presidential bids in 1988 and 2008, Biden's experience and relatability made him an ideal vice-presidential candidate for Barack Obama. As vice president, Biden formed a close bond with Obama, helping pass significant legislation like the Affordable Care Act and publicly supporting same-sex marriage. Biden’s tenure was marked by personal loss, including the death of his son Beau, which influenced his decision not to run in 2016. Biden’s legacy is intertwined with Trump’s. But with Biden now ending his much-touted re-match with Trump, it remains to be seen how the history judges the gritty 81-year-old Democratic who stayed resilient till he couldn't.

Despite resisting calls to step down for more than three weeks, Biden's fate was sealed after influential voices within his party, from actor George Clooney to former president Barack Obama, urged him to reconsider. His diagnosis with Covid, which forced him off the campaign trail, further compounded the situation.

Her life story as the first woman and the first person of Black and South Asian origin to hold the vice presidency has also resonated with voters. Harris is set to be nominated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on August 19, in what promises to be a dramatic and heartrending moment for Biden. Biden took office in January 2021 pledging to heal the ""soul of America"" after four turbulent years under Trump and the January 6 Capitol assault by Trump's supporters. He pushed through significant policies, including a massive COVID recovery plan and a green industry scheme, and received praise for his strong support for Ukraine against Russia's invasion. However, his tenure faced criticism over the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan and persistent inflation, contributing to an image of frailty played up by Republicans. Former President Bill Clinton and ex-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised Joe Biden’s decision to step aside from the 2024 presidential race on Sunday and expressed their full support for Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee. In a joint statement, the Clintons lauded Biden's ""extraordinary career of service"" and said they were ""honored"" to back Harris as the party's new candidate. They emphasised their commitment to supporting her campaign. The Clintons also voiced their deep concern about the possibility of a second term for Donald Trump, describing his promises as threatening to democratic values, stating, ""Nothing has made us more worried for our country than the threat posed by a second Trump term. He has promised to be a dictator on day one.""

Indian-origin man shot dead in suspected road rage incident in US state Indiana,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/indian-origin-man-fatally-shot-in-suspected-road-rage-incident-in-us-state-indiana-12774029.html,World,"July 21, 2024 07:51 PM","A 29-year-old newly-wedded Indian-origin man was shot dead in front of his wife in the US state of Indiana in a suspected road rage incident. The accused shooter, initially detained at the scene, was later released, indicating they may have acted in “self-defense” as the victim was carrying a handgun when he confronted the other driver in a pickup truck. According to police and media reports, the incident occurred on July 16 at an intersection in Indianapolis. Police said the victim, identified as Gavin Dasaur, was on his way home with his Mexican wife, Viviana Zamora. Dasaur, from Agra in Uttar Pradesh, had married Zamora on June 29, just over two weeks before his death, according to local WTHR reports. Witnesses stated that a confrontation took place between Dasaur, driving a black Honda, and a person driving a Chevy pickup. A mobile phone video, shot by another driver, shows Dasaur exiting his car in an irate state, yelling at the driver of the pickup truck. The video shows Dasaur carrying a handgun in his right hand. As he approaches the driver’s side of the pickup truck, he punches the door with the gun in his hand. He then switches the gun to his left hand while simultaneously raising his right hand to the truck’s window. The driver of the pickup responded by shooting three times, causing Dasaur to immediately drop to the ground. The shooter never exited his vehicle during the seven-second confrontation. Indianapolis Police Department (IMPD) officer Amanda Hibschman said officials responded to a report of a person shot just after 8 pm on July 16 at an intersection on the city's southeast side. Arriving officers found a man on the ground suffering from at least one gunshot wound. The victim’s wife identified the shooting victim. “I held him as he bled out and I was waiting for the ambulance,” she told The Indianapolis Star. The IMPD said the investigation into the shooting and alleged road rage incident is ongoing. Dasaur’s wife condemned the shooting while grieving her husband’s death. “He was a hardworking man who always went out of his way to help anyone and wanted to give the world to me and his family,” she told a local outlet.

Yemen rebels say death toll rises to six in Israeli strike on port,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/yemen-rebels-say-death-toll-rises-to-six-in-israeli-strike-on-port-12774019.html,World,"July 21, 2024 07:08 PM","The death toll from an Israeli strike on Yemen's rebel-held port of Hodeida climbed to six, Huthi health authorities said on Sunday, with firefighting teams battling a blaze at the harbour. Saturday's strike on the port, a key entry point for fuel and humanitarian aid to war-ravaged Yemen, is the first claimed by Israel in the Arabian peninsula's poorest country, about 2,000 kilometres (1,300 miles) away. It killed six people and injured 83, many of them with severe burns, the rebel-run health ministry said in a statement carried by Huthi media. It said three others remained missing. Earlier, Huthi military spokesman Yahya Saree said the rebels' ""response to the Israeli aggression against our country is inevitably coming and will be huge"". Israel said it carried out the strike in response to a drone attack by the Huthis on Tel Aviv which killed one person on Friday. More operations against the Huthis will follow ""if they dare to attack us"", Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said. After the strike, the Israeli military said on Sunday it intercepted a missile fired from Yemen towards the Red Sea resort town of Eilat, noting that ""the projectile did not cross into Israeli territory"". Saree, the Huthi spokesman, said the rebels had fired ballistic missiles towards Eilat, the latest in a string of Huthi attempts to hit the port city. The rebel announcement came as firefighters struggled to contain the blaze in Hodeida, with thick plumes of smoke above the city, said an AFP correspondent. Fuel storage tanks and a power plant at the port were still ablaze amid ""slow"" firefighting efforts, said a port employee. The employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity for security concerns, said it could take days to contain the fire, a view echoed by Yemen experts. ""There is concern that the poorly equipped firefighters may not be able to contain the spreading fire, which could continue for days,"" said Mohammed Albasha, senior Middle East analyst for the US-based Navanti Group, warning that it could reach food storage facilities at the harbour. - 'Dire humanitarian effects' - Hodeida port, a vital entry point for fuel imports and international aid for rebel-held areas of Yemen, had remained largely untouched through the decade-long war between the Huthis and the internationally recognised government propped up by neighbouring Saudi Arabia. The Huthis control swathes of Yemen, including much of its Red Sea coast, and the war has left millions of Yemenis dependent on aid supplied through the port. Despite Huthi assurances of sufficient fuel stocks, Saturday's strike triggered fears of worsening shortages. The attack is ""going to have dire humanitarian effects on the millions of ordinary Yemenis living in Huthi-held Yemen,"" Nicholas Brumfield, a Yemen expert, said on social media platform X. It will drive up prices of fuel but also any goods carried by truck, the analyst said. Yemen's internationally-recognised government condemned the strike and held Israel responsible for a worsening humanitarian crisis. A statement carried by the official Saba news agency said the Yemeni government holds ""the Zionist entity fully responsible for any repercussions resulting from its airstrikes, including the deepening of a humanitarian crises"". Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani ""strongly condemned"" the attack saying it was ""an expression of the aggressive behaviour of the child-killing Israeli regime"".

Oli secured 188 votes in favour of the Vote of Confidence motion tabled by him while 74 votes were cast against him. Out of a total of 263 members of the House of Representatives who were present, one member abstained. Oli, 72, required 138 votes to pass the floor test in the lower house of Parliament. ""I declare that the motion of the vote of confidence tabled by Prime Minister Oli has been endorsed with a majority,"" announced Speaker Devraj Ghimire after the counting of votes. According to Nepal's Constitution, Oli needed to secure a vote of confidence from Parliament within 30 days of appointment. He was sworn in on Monday as Nepal's Prime Minister for a fourth time. Earlier while tabling the motion seeking a vote of confidence in his government, Oli made public the content of the seven-point agreement reached between the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML earlier this month. Oli said that the agreement between the two major parties was part of the two largest partiesâ efforts to address the country's pressing issues. ""We [the two parties] compete in our ideologies, but there are instances of collaboration between the Congress and the UML,â he said. ""This is a continuation of that collaboration. We have agreed to work together to protect national interests, control corruption, improve governance, expedite development activities, and ensure political stability, in accordance with the public desire,"" Oli said. Oli said his government will neither tolerate corruption nor let it happen. He said the government will confidently move forward for good governance. Responding to issues raised by the HoR members Oli said, âI was not and will not get involved in corruption neither will tolerate if any one practices so.â House of Representatives members belonging to the ruling alliance Nepali Congress, CPN-UML, Lokatantrik Samajwadi Party and Janata Samajwadi Party Nepal were among those who voted in favour of Oliâs Vote of Confidence motion. Opposition parties CPN-Maoist Centre, CPN-Unified Socialist, Rashtriya Swotantra Party and Rastriya Prajatantra Party among others voted against Oli during the floor test. The veteran Communist leader was sworn in on Monday as the Himalayan nation's prime minister and was administered the oath of office and secrecy along with 21 other members of the Cabinet. Meanwhile, Nepal's Supreme Court on Sunday forwarded a petition challenging Oli's appointment as the country's prime minister to a constitutional bench, citing the need for a âserious constitutional interpretationâ. Within hours of his swearing-in on Monday, three advocates filed the petition at the apex court, arguing that Oli's appointment was unconstitutional and sought a mandamus order to annul it. The Chairman of the CPN-UML, Nepal's largest communist party was appointed as prime minister on Sunday by President Ram Chandra Paudel to lead the coalition government with the Nepali Congress (NC), the largest party in Parliament, apart from other smaller parties. Oli succeeded Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda,' who lost the vote of confidence in the House of Representatives on July 12. The CPN-UML Chairman now leads the new coalition government that faces the daunting challenge of providing political stability in the Himalayan nation. Nepal has faced frequent political turmoil as the country has seen 14 governments in the past 16 years after the introduction of the Republican system.

China devises strategy to attack Starlink-like satellites with submarine laser weapon: Report,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/china-devises-strategy-to-attack-starlink-like-satellites-with-submarine-laser-weapon-report-12773972.html,World,"July 21, 2024 05:02 PM","In another instance of China's skyrocketing defense ambition, scientists of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have conducted a study to take down Elon Musk's Starlink satellites in case they pose a security risk. According to a report published in South China Morning Post (SCMP) citing a peer-reviewed paper in the Chinese-language journal, Command Control & Simulation, it was noted how laser weapons fired from submarines can be used to take down Starlink-like satellites in space. Wang Dan, a professor at the Naval Submarine Academy, noted in the paper that the biggest challenge in anti-satellite missions was not hitting the satellite but hiding after the attack. “Currently, the primary means of anti-satellite operations rely on ground-to-air missiles, but this approach has certain issues, mainly in terms of concealment,” Wang and her colleagues wrote in the paper as reported by South China Morning Post. The paper also outlined a step-by-step process to attack Starlink-like satellites from the ocean and sea. “First, one or several submarines equipped with laser weapons are deployed to the sea area where the operation is to be conducted. They enter the target sea area according to the command instructions and wait for the satellites to come within their attack range. The time to raise the laser weapon is determined based on the previously acquired satellite overhead time,” the research paper further elaborated as reported by SCMP. Meanwhile, according to an earlier report published by news agency Reuters, SpaceX is building a network of hundreds of spy satellites under a classified contract with a US intelligence agency, five sources familiar with the program said, demonstrating deepening ties between billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's space company and national security agencies.The network is being built by SpaceX's Starshield business unit under a $1.8 billion contract signed in 2021 with the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), an intelligence agency that manages spy satellites, the sources said. The satellites can track targets on the ground and share that data with U.S. intelligence and military officials, the sources said. In principle, that would enable the US government to quickly capture continuous imagery of activities on the ground nearly anywhere on the globe, aiding intelligence and military operations. *With Agency Inputs ",NEGATIVE

However, one country that is now garnering attention for largely remaining unaffected is China which has developed its tech self-sufficiency. China has been constantly developing its software which it uses in its major government operations. According to information available on the website of CrowdStrike, the company does not sell its products and services in China. In the last few years, China has reduced reliance on third-party, foreign service providers around its cybersecurity and developed local products to be used in its most major operations in the country. In a statement issued by China’s largest cybersecurity firm, 360 Security Technology, claimed that its products were “more reliable, stable, comprehensive and intelligent”. “When selecting endpoint security software, it is important to fully evaluate its defence capabilities to avoid potential security risks and ensure that business continuity and data security are not threatened,” the firm said in a social media post. According to a report published in South China Morning Post, the international airports in Beijing and Shanghai remained unaffected while airports in other parts were struggling after the outage caused by faulty update by CrowdStrike. However, international businesses which operates in China ands use CrowdStrike for security purposes reported snag in operations. Zhou Hongyi, founder of Chinese cybersecurity company 360 Security Group, released a video after the CrowdStrike incident in which he explained how the Chinese mainland Windows users were not affected as the country uses antivirus software developed by China as reported by another Chinese media outlet, Global Times.

Bangladesh's top court scales back job quotas that sparked deadly unrest,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/bangladeshs-top-court-scales-back-job-quotas-that-sparked-deadly-unrest-attorney-general-12773930.html,World,"July 21, 2024 03:04 PM","Bangladesh's top court on Sunday scaled back a controversial quota system for government job applicants, marking a partial victory for student protesters after days of nationwide unrest and deadly clashes with police that have resulted in numerous casualties. Frustrated by the lack of good job opportunities, students have been demanding an end to a quota that reserved 30 percent of government jobs for relatives of veterans from Bangladesh's 1971 independence war. The government abolished the quota in 2018 following mass protests, but the High Court reinstated it in June, sparking new demonstrations. Ruling on an appeal, the Supreme Court ordered that the veterans' quota be reduced to 5 percent, with 93 percent of jobs allocated on merit. The remaining 2 percent will be reserved for ethnic minorities, transgender individuals, and people with disabilities. The protests have posed a significant challenge to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government since she secured a fourth consecutive term in January elections, which were boycotted by main opposition groups. In response to the unrest, universities have been closed, the internet shut off, and a stay-at-home order issued. Violence escalated on Tuesday, a day after students at Dhaka University clashed with police. Authorities used tear gas, rubber bullets, and smoke grenades to disperse stone-throwing protesters. While official casualty figures have not been released, the Daily Prothom Alo newspaper reported that at least 103 people have died so far. Sporadic clashes continued in parts of Dhaka on Saturday, though it was unclear if there were any further fatalities. Soldiers patrolled cities ahead of the Supreme Court hearing, and Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan announced that the stay-at-home order would be relaxed from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday for essential errands. The government also declared Sunday and Monday public holidays, with only emergency services operational. Protesters argue that the quota system is discriminatory and benefits Hasina's supporters, calling for a merit-based system instead. Hasina defends the quota, asserting that veterans deserve high respect for their war contributions, regardless of political affiliation. Representatives from both sides met on Friday to seek a resolution. Law Minister Anisul Huq stated that the government was open to discussing the protesters' demands, which included reforming the quota system, reopening student dormitories shut by police, and the resignation of university officials who failed to protect campuses from violence. The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has backed the protests and plans to organise its demonstrations. However, the BNP denies responsibility for the violence and refutes the ruling party's accusations of exploiting the protests for political gains. The Awami League and BNP have a history of accusing each other of fueling political chaos, most recently during the national election, which saw a crackdown on several opposition figures. Hasina's government accused the opposition of attempting to disrupt the vote. In light of the Supreme Court's decision, attorney-general AM Amin Uddin confirmed that the High Court's verdict was deemed illegal. He added that five percent of civil service jobs would remain reserved for children of independence war veterans and two percent for other categories. The top court also urged student protesters to return to class, as conveyed by Shah Monjurul Hoque, the lawyer representing two students in the case against the quota scheme.

'Who Am I? Razakar!': How a term with a bloody history made a comeback during Bangladesh quota protests,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/who-am-i-razakar-how-a-term-with-a-bloody-history-made-a-comeback-during-bangladesh-quota-protests-12773858.html,World,"July 21, 2024 10:00 AM","When Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina referred to the students protesting against the job quotas as ‘Razakars’, the enraged student protesters allegedly escalated the unrest and created violence. The demonstrations — called mainly by student groups— started weeks ago to protest a quota system that reserves up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh’s war of independence in 1971. Violence erupted Tuesday, with the Daily Prothom Alo newspaper reporting the death of at least 103 people. Police imposed a strict curfew with a “shoot-on-sight” order across Bangladesh as military forces patrolled parts of the capital Saturday after scores were killed and hundreds injured in clashes over the allocation of civil service jobs. The term ‘Razakar’ angered student protesters because the word is considered derogatory in Bangladesh. The word has been long used to describe Bangladeshis who sided with the Pakistani government which was ousted by Muktijoddhas led by Sheikh Mujibur Rehman, Sheikh Hasina’s father, following the 1971 Liberation War which led to the birth of the nation.When someone is called Razakar in Bangladesh, the person is often considered equivalent to being a traitor. A report by BBC Bangla says the term came into existence in 1971 and was used to refer to individuals who led the Pakistani army officials to the houses of the Muktijoddha rebels who were fighting against the imposition of Urdu in Bangladesh and fighting to keep Bengali as the official language of the country. The report says that the Razakar camp was first established in Khulna district of Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) in Ansar Ali Road, consisting of 100 pro-Pakistani Bangladeshis. Jamaat-e-Islami leader AKM Yusuf played a major role in the establishment of the Razakars. The former chief of staff of the Pakistan Army also introduced a Razakar law where a monthly stipend was paid to the Razakars. BBC Bangla in its report citing experts said that the Razakars had swelled to 50,000 in number. These Razakars are one of the three militia groups the Pakistani government formed to suppress civil liberties of Bengalis living in Bangladesh but who were opposed to Pakistani rule. The Razakars, the al-Badr and the al-Shams were backed by radical Islamists who then committed heinous war crimes like rape, torture, mass deportation of Bengali Hindus and Muslims in Bangladesh. They also targeted intellectuals, freedom fighters and in some cases even innocent civilians. Members of the Razakars were identified after Bangladesh’s liberation and in the last couple of decades they have been presented before war crimes tribunals and committees and sentenced to jail, life imprisonment and in some cases were given the death penalty. Amjad Hossain Howladar, Sahar Ali Sardar, Atiyar Rahman, Motachim Billah, Kamal Uddin Goldar, and Nazrul Islam were sentenced to death in Bangladesh in 2022. All of them, members of the Razakar Army, were responsible for crimes against humanity. Dr Muntasir Mamoon, Bangabandhu Chair at Bangladesh’s Chittagong University, speaking to the Indian Express, said the word Razakar originates from the word ‘Rezakar’ and and it can be traced to Telangana capital Hyderabad which was a princely state before Indian Independence. These Rezakars were home guards and paramilitary volunteer forces of the Hyderabadi kingdom that resisted integration with India but were defeated in the hands of the Indian Army in Operation Polo. Mamoon also said that these Razakars of Bangladesh ‘comprised Biharis and poor people’ and were against the ‘liberation of Bangladesh’, while speaking to the newspaper. The newspaper in its report also cited passages from Yelena Biberman’s book Gambling with Violence: State Outsourcing of War in Pakistan and India, where the author citing a former Razakar said that the Razakars were ‘poor and illiterate soldiers that fought for the West Pakistan army believing the religious motive and believed they were fighting for Islam’. WHAT DID HASINA SAY AND HOW PROTESTERS REACTED Sheikh Hasina’s ‘Razakar’ statement came last Sunday (July 14) where she said: “If the grandchildren of freedom fighters do not receive (quota) benefits, who would get it? The grandchildren of Razakars?” This had led to protest songs like “Tui ke? Ami ke? Razakar, Razakar! (Who are you? Who am I? Razakar, Razakar!)” – a spinoff of the original Tumi Ke Ami Ke, Bangali, Bangali (Who are you? Who am I? Bengali, Bengali!) which protesters used in 2013 as well to call for the hanging of Abdul Quader Mollah, a Bangladeshi Islamist leader convicted of committing war crimes. Protesters claim that Hasina is labelling them as Razakars to curb dissent. The term has caused several other issues in the past as well. In 2019, the Hasina government released a list of over 10,780 names of Razakars who conspired with the Pakistani government during the Liberation War. The list, which the Bangladesh government later rescinded, happened to contain the name of then International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) Chief Prosecutor Golam Arif Tipu who hails from a family of freedom fighters. In 2024, the Bangladesh government said that the Razakar will list will have two categories – one, who voluntarily joined the group and two, who forcibly joined. HASINA DENOUNCES APPROPRIATION Sheikh Hasina also lashed out at protesters singing songs like “Chaite gelam odhikar, hoye gelam Razakar (“I went to ask for rights; instead became a Razakar)” saying that the students do not know the pain people experienced in 1971. She also pointed out that the female student protestors singing this song should know what Razakars did to women during the Liberation War. “I felt sorry when I heard yesterday the students of Ruqayyah Hall calling themselves Razakars. Do they know what had taken place there on 25 March, 1971? Some 300 girls were killed and 40 girls were raped and taken to the Pakistani camps,” Hasina told Prothom Alo. “They don’t feel ashamed to call themselves Razakars…They do not know how the Pakistani occupation forces and Razakar Bahini had resorted to torture in the country—they did not see the inhuman torture and bodies lying on the roads. So, they don’t feel ashamed to call themselves Razakar,” she further added. An Awami League supporter told the Indian Express that Hasina during the press conference used the word Razakar ‘sarcastically’ and that the protesting students misunderstood the message. “Even now, if you are the son of a Razakar, people will say ‘you are a Razakar’s son’,” Mamoon told the Indian Express, and added that the term is not a ‘badge of honour’.

The unrest, led primarily by students, erupted in response to a court order reinstating a 30 percent job quota for families of war veterans. What began as weeks of peaceful demonstrations has now spiraled into deadly chaos, claiming numerous lives and leaving scores wounded. Amidst the escalating violence, the Supreme Court is set to convene later on Sunday to deliver a crucial verdict on whether to abolish the controversial job quotas, a decision that could potentially quell or further inflame the nationwide unrest. A breakdown of what we know so far: What's the reason behind the protest? Many students are protesting against the government’s quota system, which reserves more than half of civil service posts for certain groups. 30 percent of those govt jobs are reserved for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh’s war of independence from Pakistan in 1971. The protesters say the quota system is discriminatory and favours supporters of Hasina’s ruling Awami League party. They are demanding recruitment based on merit. The protests started on July 1, days after a decision by the Bangladesh High Court to reinstate the 30 percent government job quota to families of war veterans.

The development comes just a day after the US issued a new travel advisory for Bangladesh, urging Americans to reconsider their travel to the strife-torn country. Authorities in Bangladesh has imposed a strict curfew across the country and military personnel patrolled parts of the capital to quell further violence after days of clashes over the allocation of government jobs left more than 40 people dead and hundreds injured. The US Department of State raised the Travel Advisory Level for Bangladesh to Level 4 — 'Do Not Travel'. ""Do not travel to Bangladesh due to civil unrest, crime, and terrorism,"" the State Department said, adding, ""The department allowed for the voluntary departure of non-emergency US government employees and family members."" ""The Government of Bangladesh has declared a curfew throughout Bangladesh, ordering everyone to stay indoors. The Bangladeshi Army has been deployed throughout the country to reinforce the police. Telecommunications have been interrupted in Dhaka and across the country. Due to the security situation, there may be a delay in provision of routine consular services,"" the advisory stated. The US State Department said crimes such as muggings, burglaries, assaults, and illegal drug trafficking constitute the majority of criminal activity in Bangladesh's major cities, but there are no indications foreigners are being targeted because of their nationality. These crimes tend to be situational, based on time and location, it said. The advisory said attacks can happen with little or no warning, with terrorists targeting public areas such as tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, restaurants, places of worship, school campuses, and government facilities. Because of the security concerns, US Embassy personnel in Bangladesh are subject to some movement and travel restrictions. The US government may have limited ability to provide emergency services to its citizens in Bangladesh due to these travel restrictions, a lack of infrastructure and limited host government emergency response resources, it said. The department asked US nationals to take certain precautions, such as avoiding demonstrations and political gatherings, monitoring local media for breaking events and being prepared to adjust plans, in case they decide to travel to Bangladesh. ""Do not physically resist any robbery attempt. Get to a safe area and report any criminal incident to local authorities. Enrol in the Smart Traveller Enrolment Program to receive alerts including updates on consular services so that it is easier to locate you in an emergency,"" the other recommendations from the State Department stated.

Bangladesh army enforces curfew as student-led protests spiral,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/bangladesh-army-enforces-curfew-as-student-led-protests-spiral-12773627.html,World,"July 20, 2024 01:39 PM","Bangladesh soldiers patrolled Dhaka’s deserted streets on Saturday amid a curfew to quell deadly student-led protests against government job quotas that have killed more than 100 people this week. A suspension on internet and text message services has remained in place since Thursday, cutting off Bangladesh from the world as police cracked down on protests that have continued despite a ban on public gatherings. The violent clashes have killed at least 105 people and injured thousands this week, according to data from hospitals across Bangladesh. The Dhaka Medical College Hospital received 27 dead bodies on Friday between 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. The nationwide unrest initially broke out over student anger against new quotas for government jobs, including 30% for the families of those who fought for independence from Pakistan. That measure has opened old and sensitive political fault lines between those who fought for Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan in 1971 and those accused of collaborating with Islamabad. Over the past five days, police have fired tear gas and hurled sound grenades to scatter protesters during the nationwide unrest, as demonstrators clashed with security personnel, throwing bricks and setting fire to vehicles. With the death toll climbing and police unable to contain the violent protests, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government on Friday imposed a national curfew and deployed the military. The curfew will ease for two hours from 12 p.m. on Saturday to allow people to shop for supplies and complete other chores, TV channels reported. The curfew will last until 10 a.m. on Sunday at which point the government will assess the situation and decide the next course of action, the reports added. The demonstrations – the biggest since Hasina was re-elected for a fourth successive term this year – have also been fuelled by high unemployment among young people, who make up nearly a fifth of a population of 170 million. International rights groups have criticised the internet suspension and actions of security forces. The European Union said it is deeply concerned by the violence and loss of life.

Jane Street gets millennium trade secrets countersuit tossed,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/jane-street-gets-millennium-trade-secrets-countersuit-tossed-12773632.html,World,"July 20, 2024 01:34 PM","A federal judge threw out counterclaims against Jane Street Group by Millennium Management and two former traders whom Jane Street accused of stealing a valuable Indian options trading strategy. In a ruling Thursday night, US District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan rejected Millennium’s argument that Jane Street’s April trade secrets lawsuit constituted unfair competition because it was brought in “bad faith,” with the sole goal of harming a rival’s business and reputation. It was the second favorable ruling for Jane Street in recent days, following a series of adverse ones earlier in the case. A week ago, Engelmayer threw out an “unclean hands” defense asserting that losses suffered by Jane Street were due to its own “highly unusual trading activity” rather than alleged strategy theft. The judge on Thursday said the unfair competition counterclaim failed because Jane Street wasn’t trying to improperly benefit from any labor or investment by Millennium. Millennium and Jane Street both declined to comment on the ruling. Judge’s SkepticismIn its lawsuit, Jane Street accused former traders Douglas Schadewald and Daniel Spottiswood of taking a highly confidential and “immensely valuable” trading strategy to new jobs at Izzy Englander’s hedge fund group in February. Though all details of the strategy were initially redacted in court filings, it was inadvertently revealed at an April 19 hearing that it involved options trading in India. At that same hearing, Engelmayer dealt a blow to Jane Street by denying its request for a restraining order barring Millennium and the two traders from using the strategy. Millennium, Schadewald and Spottiswood pointed to that decision in their May countersuits. Schadewald, Spottiswood and Millennium deny stealing any trade secrets. The two traders claimed credit for building the Indian options business at Jane Street but said it was based on their experience and expertise rather than any secret “algorithms or automated signals.” Millennium noted that it has been trading in India for years, winning regulatory approval in 2016 to hold Indian securities as a foreign entity. Engelmayer has previously expressed skepticism about Jane Street’s suit, saying at a May 16 hearing that he didn’t think the proprietary trading firm had identified an actionable trade secret. He ordered Jane Street to provide a more detailed filing on its strategy. Closed ConferenceThe judge ruled last month that Jane Street had to share that filing with Schadewald and Spottiswood, rejecting its argument that it would give them a “roadmap” for further theft. But Engelmayer has more recently found legal overreach on the part of Millennium, Schadewald and Spottiswood. In rejecting some of their defenses last week, the judge said they failed to adequately allege that Jane Street engaged in “unconscionable” conduct directly related to the case. On Thursday, in addition to tossing the unfair competition claim, Engelmayer dismissed counterclaims seeking legal fees from Jane Street. He said the claims were improperly brought under the trade secrets statute but that Millennium, Schadewald and Spottiswood could seek fees if they ultimately prevail in the case. The two sides are scheduled to appear before Engelmayer later on Friday for a conference that was closed to the public by the judge because it’s expected “to address confidential matters related to Jane Street’s alleged trade secret and other proprietary trading strategies.” The case is Jane Street Group LLC v. Millennium Management LLC, 24-cv-02783, US District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Singapore is Asia’s biggest oil-trading hub and the world’s largest bunkering port. Its surrounding waters are vital trade waterways between Asia and Europe and the Middle East and among the busiest global sea lanes. The Singapore-flagged tanker Hafnia Nile and the Sao Tome and Principe-flagged tanker Ceres I were about 55 km (34 miles) northeast of the Singaporean island of Pedra Branca on the eastern approach to the Singapore Straits, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) said. The 22 crew of the Hafnia Nile and the 40 on the Ceres I were all accounted for, said the MPA, which was alerted to the fire at 6:15 a.m. (2215 GMT). Hafnia, the operator of Hafnia Nile, confirmed the vessel collided with Chinese-owned Ceres I. Hafnia added in a statement that a tug is on scene to assist the ship, which is drifting toward open sea. Specialized tugs are en route to join firefighting efforts and are expected to arrive within hours. The exact circumstances leading to the incident are unknown. Photographs released by the Singapore Navy showed thick black smoke billowing from one tanker and crew being rescued from life rafts and flown to hospital. Environmental authorities in neighbouring Malaysia said they had been told to prepare for potential oil spills. Norway's Gard, one of Hafnia Nile's insurers, told Reuters it was too early to assess the environmental impact. ”We are supporting our member as they are dealing with the incident,” Gard said. Navigational traffic had not been affected, although the status of the vessels or any pollution was unknown at present, a spokesperson at the UN’s International Maritime Organization (IMO) said. ”No aerial surveillance has been conducted so far,” the spokesperson said. ”Salvage and firefighting assets have been arranged by both vessel owners to support the firefighting efforts and subsequent towage of the vessels to safety.” The IMO spokesperson said a salvage team had been appointed and was en route to the area. The 74,000-deadweight-tons capacity panamax tanker Hafnia Nile was carrying about 300,000 barrels of naphtha, according to ship-tracking data from Kpler and LSEG. The Ceres I is a very large crude carrier supertanker, which ship-tracking data last showed was carrying around 2 million barrels of Iranian crude. ”The Ceres I has been a boat that has gone dark many times over the years,” said Matt Stanley, head of market engagement EMEA & APAC with Kpler, referring to when vessels switch off their AIS tracking transponders. Stanley said the last AIS signal the vessel transmitted around March indicated it was carrying Iranian crude, which the U.S. has tried to curtail, including imposing sanctions on ports, vessels and refineries involved in the trade. ”She was at anchorage (on Friday). We can be fairly sure that she was carrying Iranian crude and was going to China,” Stanley said. SHADOW FLEET RISKS S&P Global said in an April report that China buys around 90% of Iran’s crude exports, often at discounted prices. The Ceres I has not moved since July 11, according to LSEG shipping data. The area Ceres I is anchored in is known to be used by so-called dark fleet ships for the transfer of Iranian oil in contravention of U.S. sanctions, said Michelle Wiese Bockmann, principal analyst at Lloyd’s List Intelligence. ”The Ceres I has repeatedly been involved in transferring or shipping Iranian oil in breach of U.S. sanctions,” she said. Shipping sources have said the tanker was also involved in transporting Venezuelan oil, which is also under U.S. sanctions, to China in recent years. The China-based owner of the Ceres I could not immediately be reached for comment. China has repeatedly said it opposes unilateral sanctions. Up to 850 oil tankers are estimated to operate the shadow fleet transporting oil from countries such as Iran and Venezuela as well as Russia, which has multiple restrictions on its oil exports. Shipping industry officials have warned that safety issues are growing because of the ageing and unregulated vessels. The Ceres I vessel was built in 2001 while the Hafnia Nile was built in 2017, shipping data showed. It was unclear who provided insurance for the Ceres I, which was not covered by top-tier providers such as Gard, according to other data.

But achieving consensus will not be easy, given the disappointing progress made on the issue at the mid-year UN Climate talks in Bonn, Germany.The COP29 presidency said 50 per cent of the capital will go to climate projects in developing countries, focusing on clean energy, energy efficiency, climate resilience, and new technologies. The remaining half will help meet members' NDCs to keep the 1.5-degree-Celsius target within reach. Twenty per cent of revenues will be directed to a Rapid Response Funding Facility for immediate, highly concessional, and grant-based disaster response support. ""This facility will offer immediately accessible funding to address the consequences of natural disasters in Small Island Developing States, Least Developed Countries, and other vulnerable developing communities,"" the statement said. Harjeet Singh, Global Engagement Director for the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, said the announcement of a new fund undeniably puts a spotlight on the fossil fuel industry's role in the climate crisis. ""However, its proposed design dangerously grants a social license for the ongoing extraction of gas, oil, and coal. This is far from the robust accountability we have long demanded to hold the fossil fuel industry responsible for denying and delaying climate action. ""The COP29 Presidency's plan for the climate summit this November lacks the ambition to phase out fossil fuels and falls massively short in supporting a just transition for developing nations. True climate justice means holding the fossil fuel industry financially responsible for the destruction it has caused, not facilitating its continued operation under the guise of tiny contributions to climate solutions,"" he said. Last year's UN climate conference in Dubai ended with a global agreement calling for transitioning away from fossil fuels to reach net zero emissions by 2050. In a letter sent to all countries that are signatories to the UN climate change convention earlier this week, Azerbaijan urged for a political push to break the deadlock on the new climate finance goal. At the 2009 UN climate conference in Copenhagen, rich nations pledged to provide USD 100 billion annually from 2020 to help developing countries mitigate and adapt to climate change. However, delays in achieving this goal have eroded trust between developed and developing nations and have been a continual source of contention during annual climate negotiations. In May, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) claimed that developed countries had met the long-standing USD 100 billion-a-year promise by providing nearly USD 116 billion in climate finance to developing countries in 2022, with nearly 70 per cent of the money given in the form of loans. However, the international non-profit Oxfam last week said climate finance provided by rich countries in 2022 totalled no more than USD 35 billion. Developing nations argue they cannot be expected to reduce CO2 emissions faster if developed countries — historically responsible for climate change — do not provide enhanced financial support. Rich countries are now expected to raise more than USD 100 billion, with developing countries, including India, demanding trillions of dollars to tackle climate change.

Congressman Krishnamoorthi denounces racist attack on Harmeet Dhillon for Sikh prayer at RNC,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/congressman-krishnamoorthi-denounces-racist-attack-on-harmeet-dhillon-for-sikh-prayer-at-rnc-12773522.html,World,"July 20, 2024 08:36 AM","Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi has denounced the racist response to Republican National Committeewoman Harmeet Dhillon's recital of Sikh prayer 'ardas' in the presence of the party's presidential nominee Donald Trump, and said it was ""completely unacceptable"". Dhillon, a Republican Party leader and Civil Rights Attorney, recited the prayers at the four-day Republican National Convention that began last Monday. Delegates and officials had gathered at the event in Milwaukee to greet Trump like a hero for the first time since a gunman opened fire at the former president during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, grazing his ear.Following her recital of 'ardas', Dhillon was trolled on social media and most of them appeared to be from her party's support base. In a statement on Friday, Krishnamoorthi said, ""The reprehensible and racist response to Republican National Committeewoman Harmeet Dhillon’s Sikh prayer on Monday night is completely unacceptable."" Krishnamoorthi, a four-term Congressman from Illinois, is a Democrat.""Discrimination on the basis of race or religion has no place in America, and must be called out and strongly condemned by Democrats and Republicans alike when it occurs,"" he said. The Congressman has been vocal in speaking against discrimination against Indian Americans, cutting across party lines. At the Republican National Convention last Monday, Dhillon (55) said, ""These last 48 hours have been some of the most intense, yet more prayerful of our lives, the heinous attack on President Trump and his supporters made all of us pause and seek answers in comfort."" A video posted on 'X' by the California Republican Party, showed Dhillon saying at the Fiserv Forum: ""I come from a family of Sikh immigrants, and I'm honoured to share with you, my fellow Republicans and guests tonight, a prayer from my faith and tradition practised by over 25 million worldwide."" ""We recite the Ardas (Sikh prayer) before any new endeavour, giving thanks to God and asking for his protection and help to uphold the values of humility, truth, courage, service, and justice for all,"" she added. ""Dear Waheguru, our one true God, we thank you for creating America as a unique heaven on this Earth, where all people are free to worship according to their faith. We seek your blessings and guidance for our beloved country. Please bless our people with wisdom as they vote for the upcoming election and please bless with humility, honesty, skill and integrity all those who conduct the election,"" she had said after offering the 'ardas'. News outlet Mother Jones reported that Dhillon's prayer ""set off a firestorm in the far-right corners of Christian Twitter"". Andrew Torba, CEO of far-right social media platform Gab, ranted to his 400,000 followers on X, saying that ""Christian nationalism must be exclusively and explicitly Christian"".Republican Oklahoma state Senator Dusty Deevers seemed to agree, the news outlet reported. ""Christians in the Republican party nodding silently along to a prayer to a demon god is shameful,"" he posted.

A spokesperson for Meta didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Nigeria, which is Africa’s most populous country, also has one of the world’s highest number of internet users with 154 million active subscribers in 2022, according to the country’s statistics agency. Despite the high number of internet users in the country, Meta has failed to comply with the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation, has failed to engage a Data Protection Compliance Organization and hasn’t filed the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation audit report for two years, the consumer protection agency said. In addition to the USD 220 million fine, the agency’s order mandated Meta to comply with local laws and cease the ”exploitation” of Nigerian consumers. The investigation into the reported abuses first commenced in May 2021 when the agency opened an inquiry into WhatsApp’s updated privacy policy. It later informed Meta of its findings, after which the company proposed a ”remedy package” that failed to address initial concerns, the statement said. (AP) NSD NSD

Australia was one of many countries affected by the outage that caused havoc worldwide after a botched software update from CrowdStrike. On Saturday, the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) – the country’s cyber intelligence agency – said ”a number of malicious websites and unofficial code are being released claiming to help entities recover from the widespread outages caused by the CrowdStrike technical incident”. On its website, the agency said its cyber security centre ”strongly encourages all consumers to source their technical information and updates from official CrowdStrike sources only”. Cyber Security Minister Clare O’Neil said on social media platform X on Saturday that Australians should ”be on the lookout for possible scams and phishing attempts”. Friday’s outage hit Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the country’s largest bank, which said some customers were unable to transfer money. National airline Qantas and Sydney airport said planes were delayed but still flying. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said late on Friday that there had been no impact to critical infrastructure, government services or emergency phone systems. CrowdStrike – which previously reached a market cap of about $83 billion – is a major cybersecurity provider, with close to 30,000 subscribers globally.

Guatemala had in 2023 one of the most tense electoral processes in its recent history, after the Prosecutor’s Office tried to invalidate the election’s results and prevent Arevalo from being sworn in as president. ”A human-rights advocate I met with told me: ’Democracy is still in danger. We must do whatever is necessary to change the status quo’ and I totally agree with this assessment,” Turk said at a press conference in Guatemala City, concluding a visit to the country. During his visit this week, Turk met with Arevalo, civil-rights representatives, Indigenous leaders and businessmen, and stated that for him it was a ”priority” to support the country’s efforts to strengthen the democratic system. ”For a state to function, the three powers must work in consonance. And for now, that is not happening. The polarization between the institutional bodies is enormous,” he added, amid strong clashes between the executive, legislative and judicial powers in the country. Since taking office in January, Arevalo has lost several battles in Congress, where he only has support from 23 of 160 seats, failing to pass several laws, such as one to expand the national budget and others to declare rain emergencies.

The social media giant experienced a SEV1 as a result of the disruptions, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters, using Meta’s term for a ”code red”-style alert involving high-stakes problems with its systems that require urgent attention. In a statement, the Meta spokesperson acknowledged the issues and said they had been resolved earlier in the day. ”The global CrowdStrike outage earlier today temporarily impacted several of the tools used by some of our vendors. While this caused a small impact to some of our support operations, there was minimal to no impact on our content moderation efforts,” the spokesperson said. Like most social media companies, Meta relies on a mix of artificial intelligence and human review to moderate the billions of posts made to its platforms, which also include Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads. Some of that human review is performed by Meta staffers, but most is outsourced to business services vendors employing armies of low-paid workers who assess whether the posts contain hate speech, violence and other violations of the company’s rules. Friday’s alert involved vendor access to two of the systems Meta uses to route content flagged for review to moderators, called SRT and HumanOps, the source told Reuters. Key vendors affected were Teleperformance and Concentrix, the person said. Teleperformance did not respond to a request for comment and Concentrix said it had been monitoring and addressing impacts from the outage and that operations were continuing at expected levels.

The overnight assault on the Lobivia cargo ship came as the Iran-aligned Houthis also claimed responsibility for a fiery, long-range aerial drone strike in the center of Tel Aviv that killed one man and wounded four others. The Houthis in recent weeks have become more adept at inflicting damage on their targets. In June, the militants struck the Greek-owned Tutor coal carrier with missiles and an explosive-laden remote-controlled boat, causing it to sink. Tutor was the second ship sunk in the Houthi campaign against commercial shipping, which since November has killed at least three sailors and upended global trade by forcing ship owners to avoid the Suez Canal trade shortcut. ""Their capacity, their access to more sophisticated weapons, has only increased over the course of this conflict,"" said Gerald Feierstein, director of the Arabian Peninsula Affairs Program at the Middle East Institute in Washington. Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saree in a television speech on Friday said the group launched the Lobivia strikes, adding that the assault also included drones. The manager of Lobivia did not immediately comment.Lobivia was in the Gulf of Aden when the missiles struck two areas on its port side, the Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC) said in an incident report. The ship was located 83 nautical miles southeast of Yemen's port city of Aden during the attack. All crew are reported safe and the ship was returning to its last port of call, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) said. ""The ship was transiting northeast along the Gulf of Aden when a merchant vessel in the vicinity observed 'light and blast' where the ship was located,"" British security firm Ambrey said. The ship appeared to perform evasive manoeuvres immediately and switch off her automatic identification system approximately an hour later, Ambrey said. On Tuesday, the Houthis hit the Liberia-flagged oil tanker Chios Lion with a drone boat, causing damage to the port side that left an oily trail that experts said appeared to be fuel. Britain and the U.S. have conducted retaliatory strikes since February, shooting down drones and bombing attack sites in Yemen.That has come at a significant cost, said Feierstein, who was the U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Yemen from 2010 to 2013 under President Barack Obama.""We're basically spending a million dollars every time we shoot down a Radio Shack drone.

The High Commission of India, in coordination with BSF and Bureau of Immigration, is facilitating return of Indian students from Bangladesh, they added. The situation in Bangladesh deteriorated this week prompting authorities to stop bus and train services and shutting down schools and universities across the country.

According to a Moneycontrol poll of six brokerages, NTPC is likely to see a marginal increase of 0.07 percent in revenue at Rs 43,424 crore compared to Rs 43,390 crore reported in the same quarter last year.  Further, net profit is likely to fall 3.5 percent to Rs 4,733 crore in the June quarter, from Rs 4,907 crore in the corresponding quarter during the previous fiscal year. The most optimistic estimate sees NTPC’s net profit jumping 9 percent year-on-year, but the most pessimistic projection suggests that net profit will fall around 1.5 percent. What factors are impacting the earnings? Analysts at JM Financial expect NTPC to report a revenue of Rs 44,300 crore in Q1FY25, up 3 percent YoY. The brokerage estimates PAT to rise by 8 percent YoY due to a 10 percent YoY increase in thermal production. Here are some of the factors that can impact earnings: Increase in generation: Analysts at B&K Securities expect Q1FY25 to be a good quarter for NTPC with strong demand in the sector and the peak load increasing to 250 GW in May. ""Per our estimates, PLF for standalone generation remained strong at around 77 percent with gross generation of around 93 billion units, which is 6 percent higher than the same period last year,"" stated a report by the firm. Most brokerages are optimistic about NTPC's growing power generation. “We expect a modest growth in generation at 94 BU (+6 percent yoy) on account of expanded capacity base,” said analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities. Increase in commissioning of projects:  Analysts expect the power generation company to gain from an increase in the number of projects in both the thermal and renewable space. “With rising commissioning of projects in FY25/26 (both thermal and RE) and CERC incentives, we expect FY25 to deliver superior core RoEs vs FY24,” said analysts at Nuvama. What to look out for in the quarterly show?

Paytm gets government nod for investment in payments arm; stock soars 10%,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/paytm-gets-government-nod-for-investment-in-payments-arm-12779437.html,Companies,"July 26, 2024 02:58 PM","Paytm has got approval from the government for its 500 million rupees ($5.97 million) investment in a key subsidiary, a top finance ministry official told Reuters on Friday. The approval, which was stuck for months due to the company's link to China, will remove the main stumbling block to the unit, Paytm Payment Services, resuming normal business operations. Following the approval, shares of One97 Communications, the parent company of Paytm, surged 10 percent and was locked in the upper circuit at Rs 509.05 on the NSE. This also marks the first time since February 8 that shares of Paytm surpassed the Rs 500-level. Paytm Payment Services is one of the biggest remaining parts of the fintech firm's business, accounting for a quarter of consolidated revenue in the financial year ended March 2023. Follow our live blog for all the updates Earlier this month, Reuters reported that the government had given the investment the green light. Vivek Joshi, financial services secretary, said the company can approach India's central bank to seek a payment aggregator license which the bank will evaluate. Shares of the payments aggregator have been under pressure since February following the RBI's action against its Payments Bank. In January, the shares had reached levels as high as Rs 800, however, since then, the stock has been unable to bounceback to that mark. In the June quarter, Paytm's revenue dropped by 36 percent year-over-year to Rs 1,502 crore due to ongoing challenges from RBI restrictions. The company's net loss also widened sharply to Rs 840 crore in Q1 of FY25, the steepest loss since its listing.

India emerges as 'inspiring lighthouse of growth' amid global turbulence: ITC CMD Puri,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/india-emerges-as-inspiring-lighthouse-of-growth-amid-global-turbulence-itc-cmd-puri-12779203.html,Companies,"July 26, 2024 12:32 PM","With a consistent GDP growth rate of over 7 per cent, India has emerged as an ""inspiring lighthouse of growth"" amid a turbulent world grappling with geopolitical tensions and climate emergencies, ITC Chairman and Managing Director Sanjiv Puri said on Friday. It has a ""standout performance"" as the world's fastest-growing major economy, which has not only evoked global respect but also points to its future promise, said Puri while addressing the annual general meeting of the company. He further said analysts project India's per capita GDP is likely to touch the ""inflexion point"" of USD 4,000 by 2030, fuelling larger domestic consumption and driving higher growth. ""This is truly India’s moment in history. Mega opportunities are today emerging from the diversification in global supply chains, the all-pervasive digital revolution, and the urgent need for a green transition,"" he said. Experts predict that India is likely to contribute 18 per cent to the world's GDP growth in the next 5 years and could even touch 30 per cent between 2035 and 2040, he said. The synergy of India's large market, favourable demographics, rising disposable incomes, technological prowess and vibrant entrepreneurship will continue to power growth in the foreseeable future, he said. According to Puri, a sustained public expenditure in physical, digital, agri and rural infrastructure, combined with sharp execution, is fuelling a virtuous cycle of consumption, investment and employment. ""The rise of aspirational India will also spur consumption-led growth,"" said Puri. Over the role of Indian Enterprise in country's growth, Puri said he deeply believes that companies rooted in India, as economic organs of society, can play a ""vital role"" in partnering with the nation in the promising journey ahead. Over the global economy, Puri said the global economy is passing through a storm of geopolitical tensions, climate emergencies, cost-of-living crises, food and nutrition security concerns, and insufficient livelihood opportunities. ""This is also evident in the decline of global merchandise trade by about 1.2 per cent last year,"" he said. Amidst these adversities, rapid technological advancements, including AI are redefining the future. Puri further said India’s favourable demographics constitute one of its greatest strengths as more than a billion people, comprising nearly 70 per cent of the population, will be of working age by 2030. ""Over the next decade, almost a quarter of the incremental global workforce will be from India,"" he said adding ""This powerhouse of productive human capital is unquestionably a source of unique competitive advantage as well as a formidable driver of consumption."" The Budget 2024 has also announced multi-dimensional programmes to boost skilling and employment, strengthen MSMEs as well as provide impetus to labour-intensive sectors. ""The ONDC platform set up recently can also lend new wings to micro and small enterprises akin to the UPI’s remarkable impact on financial transactions,"" he said. The agri and rural sector, which engages nearly half of the country’s workforce, can contribute further to livelihood generation through larger value addition, digital acceleration and diversification of on-farm, off-farm and non-farm employment. ""It is indeed encouraging that the recent Budget has sharply addressed several of these areas,"" said Puri.

Bajaj Auto sees bright future in CNG motorbikes,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/bajaj-auto-sees-bright-future-in-cng-motorbikes-12778756.html,Companies,"July 26, 2024 07:48 AM","Bajaj Auto Ltd., India’s No. 1 maker of auto rickshaws, said it’s received around 6,000 orders for its new compressed natural gas-powered motorbike — a vehicle it bills as a world first — as consumers seek more affordable ways to embrace greener passenger transport. Bajaj Freedom, a sports motorcycle with a 124 cubic capacity engine, was launched earlier this month with a starting price of 95,000 rupees ($1,135). Some 100 of the bikes have already been delivered to customers, Executive Director Rakesh Sharma said in an interview. Sharma puts the addressable audience for the Freedom in the hundreds of millions. Most of Bajaj’s typical customers are price conscious, earning less than 40,000 rupees a month, and the Freedom can shave up to 1,800 rupees off fuel costs versus similarly sized bikes that run on petrol or diesel, he said. “This customer is all across the country,” Sharma said. Being lead and sulfur free, CNG-run vehicles can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and they’re also quieter than gasoline or diesel ones, which results in less noise pollution. While high levels of domestic production mean CNG in India is cheaper, its lower energy density can require vehicles to refuel more frequently. India’s petroleum and gas ministry has said it aims to build 17,500 CNG filling stations across the country by 2030. Pune-based Bajaj’s Freedom motorcycle was initially launched in states with a high penetration of CNG filling stations, such as Maharashtra, Gujarat and the metropolitan area around capital Delhi, Sharma said. It’s now open for orders across the country. Bajaj also plans to launch the bike in countries that commonly use CNG as an alternative fuel too, like Argentina, Venezuela, Nigeria and Tanzania, Sharma said, without specifying any timeline. Although Bajaj is India’s top maker of auto rickshaws it isn’t No. 1 in scooters. There, it places fourth, with a market share of around 12% behind Hero Motocorp Ltd., Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Pvt.and TVS Motor Company Ltd.. “We’ve heard other competitors are also looking at developing CNG two wheelers,” Sharma said. “It’s a defining movement for the motorcycle industry.”

For FY24, the company reported a 12.4 percent decline in its telecom sector revenue, with a steeper drop of 16.5 percent in Q4 FY24, Joshi said. However, there's a silver lining on the horizon with Q1 FY25 figures showing that the declines have now reduced to single digits. ""I expect to see some level of year-on-year improvement in the telecom business over time. I believe that our sort of position in telecom from a comparative position remains very strong,"" Joshi said. Joshi said that despite the ongoing challenges and visible spending pressures within the telecom sector, Tech Mahindra, as a major industry player, stands to gain as the sector recovers. While he doesn't expect immediate improvements, he believes that, given the sector's size, a positive trend will emerge over time.

Communications, Media, and Entertainment (CME) accounts for nearly 40 percent of the company's revenue which includes telecom as well. Telecommunication is a key differentiator for Tech Mahindra which serves seven of the top ten operators. ""If I look at the priority that operators have, these are broadly in three areas,"" Joshi said and went on to highlight cost management, revenue generation, and AI integration as the three areas. ""Whether it's a vendor consolidation or it is autonomous operations and autonomous networks, we are active in that space,"" Joshi said regarding the cost side. ""The second is revenue generation, both on the B2B and B2C side, and the wholesale network side.""

Tech Mahindra reported its Q1 FY25 earnings on July 25 wherein the company's consolidated net profit rose nearly 29 percent QoQ to Rs 851 crore, on low base effect. Revenue from operations rose 1 percent to Rs 13,005 crore. Both net profit and revenue came in slightly below Moneycontrol's estimates of Rs 861 crore and Rs 12,968 crore. Meanwhile, the company's EBIT margin expanded by 110 basis points to 8.5 percent on a QoQ basis, surpassing Moneycontrol's estimate of 8 percent. The company attributed the increase in EBIT margin to cost-saving measures under Project Fortius and operational efficiencies.

"Ramco Cements Q1 Preview: Weak prices, realisations, stiff competition pour concrete on profit hopes",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/ramco-cements-q1-preview-weak-prices-realisations-stiff-competition-pour-concrete-on-profit-hopes-12778609.html,Companies,"July 25, 2024 09:11 PM","Ramco Cements is set to present its earnings report for the first fiscal quarter of FY25 on July 26. The cement manufacturer is expected to deliver a subpar performance in Q1FY25 with net profit and revenue declining, primarily due to weaker cement prices because of increase in intense competition and higher regional concentration lately. According to a Moneycontrol poll, Ramco Cements' net profit is expected to slump 51 percent on-year to Rs 38 crore. Revenue is seen falling around 1.3 percent YoY to Rs 2,221 crore. Even the most optimistic estimate sees Ramco Cements' net profit falling 31 percent on-year. The most pessimistic projection suggests that net profit might sink nearly 69 percent YoY.  On a sequential basis, net profit and revenue are seen falling 68 percent, and 17 percent, respectively. Also Read | DLF's net profit jumps 22.5% to Rs 646 crore in Q1FY25, revenue down 4% What factors are driving the earnings? Weak demand: The slowdown in construction activities during the general elections in April and May adversely impacted cement sales in these months. Scorching heat, labour shortages, and unseasonal rain in some regions further dented demand during Q1FY25. Muted prices: Cement prices entered Q1FY25 with a steep hike announcement in some regions, but with lower-than-historical average demand and a sudden ramp-up of M&As among large players, sustaining any price hike became impossible. Hikes implemented in April were reversed during May and June due to soft demand and stiff competition. Decline in realisations: According to analysts at Motilal Oswal, price realization is likely to decline around eight percent YoY due to weak pricing in the southern region. Price realisation in cement refers to the average revenue a company earns per unit sold. It helps gauge the average income per ton, with higher realisation indicating better profitability per unit. High Costs: The cement maker's depreciation/interest expenses are estimated to increase by 14 percent and 12 percent on-year, respectively, according to Motilal Oswal. What to look out for in the quarterly show? Analysts will closely monitor Ramco Cements' management commentary on demand conditions during this seasonally weak quarter, price sustainability amid intensifying competition, and ongoing sector consolidation.

Strongest incentives from the state should be for EVs: BMW,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/strongest-incentives-from-the-state-should-be-for-evs-bmw-12778025.html,Companies,"July 25, 2024 12:06 PM","German luxury carmaker BMW on Wednesday said incentives are necessary to support the growth of the electric vehicle segment. The company, which on Wednesday introduced the all-electric MINI Countryman and electric scooter CE04 in the country, said the market here is still evolving and efforts should continue to smoothen and accelerate this transition. In a press conference here, BMW Group Senior Vice President, Region Asia Pacific, Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa Jean-Philippe Parain stated that the ""strongest incentives from the state should be for EVs"". Incentives allow to bring an electric model to a price point where transition can happen towards an electric vehicle, he noted. Parain noted that in some countries, where customers drive longer distances, plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) can be a bridge. ""But if I were to speak for India, I would focus on the full transition to full electric vehicles"", he added. In India the total tax incidence on hybrid vehicles in the country is 43 per cent, which is inclusive of GST, while battery electric vehicles attract a tax of about 5 per cent. Parain stated that there is potential for EVs in India and the company is looking to drive in more products into the country. He noted that besides battery electric vehicles, the automaker is also investing in internal combustion engine models, plug-in hybrids and also thinking about hydrogen vehicles. The company plans to remain flexible when it comes to technologies, Parain stated. Globally, he said that BMW is among the top sellers of EVs along with Tesla and BYD. He noted that the company's sales were impacted in China. ""India is an exception and there is a need to sustain this growth going forward,"" Parain stated. BMW Group India President and Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pawah stated that EVs were suitable for India. Penetration of electric vehicles in India is encouraging and once products are available across all price points, the segment will grow very fast, he noted. Pahwa also noted that the automaker, besides introducing new models, is also investing in establishing charging infrastructure to aid the growth of the segment. BMW on Wednesday introduced the all-new 5 Series Long Wheelbase in the country with price starting at Rs 72.9 lakh. The company also introduced the new Mini Cooper S and the new all-electric MINI Countryman priced at Rs 44.9 lakh and Rs 54.9 lakh respectively.

In the lawsuit filed at the United States District Court for New Jersey, Mayne Pharma accused its rival of violating all 20 Orange Book-listed patents linked to IMVEXXY - a vaginal insert aimed at reducing pain during sexual intercourse after menopause. Orange Book-listed patents are those approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and deemed safe to use. The Australian drugmaker said it filed the lawsuit after a notification indicated Sun Pharma's submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) to the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of IMVEXXY. The ANDA is a request filed to the health regulator for approval of an already licensed drug to manufacture the medication in the United States. These application processes do not warrant the applicant to go through a clinical trial. Sun Pharma did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment. Mayne Pharma's complaint also indicated that Sun Pharma filed a Paragraph IV certification, suggesting the latter challenged the patent's (IMVEXXY) listing in the Orange Book as invalid or inapplicable. This ""formally initiates the litigation process under the Hatch-Waxman Act and triggers a 30-month stay of any potential FDA approval for Sun Pharma's ANDA,"" Mayne Pharma said in a statement.

We believe that the long-term growth story of India's travel and tourism sector is fuelled by multiple macroeconomic drivers like increasing government investments in travel infrastructure, rising disposable incomes of the middle class, and increasing propensity to travel.

According to the average of 10 estimates compiled by Moneycontrol, Tech Mahindra's net profit is projected to increase over 30 percent quarter-over-quarter, reaching Rs 861 crore in Q1 FY25. Revenue from operations is expected to rise 0.8 percent QoQ to Rs 12,968 crore on the reversal of furloughs of the March quarter and stabilisation of the mortgage business. The growth, however, could be impacted marginally due to seasonal softness in its subsidiary-Comviva-a mobile application firm acquired from Bharti Group by Tech Mahindra in 2012.

Tech Mahindra's net profit for Q4 FY24 fell 40.9 percent YoY to Rs 661 crores, due to slowdowns in telecom, communications, media, and entertainment sectors. What factors are driving the earnings? 1. Volume Growth, Portfolio Reshuffling: Tech Mahindra's margins are likely to expand due to strong growth in volume and reshuffling of the portfolio, said Axis Securities. 2. Cost Management and Operational Efficiencies: The company's cost-saving initiatives, including 'Project Fortius', are projected to enhance operational efficiencies.

The deflation in certain commodities, coupled with price hikes and improved operating leverage shall support the staples giant’s margins and bottomline. According to a Moneycontrol poll of eight brokerages, Nestle is likely to report an eight percent jump in revenue at Rs 5,060 crore compared to Rs 4,659 crore reported in the same quarter last year. Net profit is likely to surge 14 percent to Rs 789 crore in the June quarter, from Rs 698 crore from the corresponding quarter during the previous fiscal year.  Earnings estimates of analysts polled by Moneycontrol are in a narrow range, so any positive or negative surprises may elicit a sharp reaction in the stock. The most optimistic estimate sees Nestle India’s net profit jumping 17 percent on-year, but the most pessimistic projection suggests that net profit will rise seven percent. What factors are impacting the earnings? Nestle India’s revenue is expected to grow 9 percent led by price hikes, rural-led distribution expansion and new product development, noted Axis Securities. Commodity prices: Nestle India’s EBITDA margin is expected to expand from 22.8 percent in Q1FY24 as a result of deflation in palm oil and milk prices. The company also passed on raw material inflation to the consumers, bumping up the price of chocolates and coffee. Segment performance: Brokerages are mixed on out-of-home products. While Kotak expects the segment to increase its contribution to the topline, Prabhudas Lilladher said, “OOH products had a setback due to heatwaves in many parts of the country whereas beverages did well due to intense summers. Volume growth: Kotak noted that volume (tonnage) growth might come in at 5 percent, which is largely in line with the previous quarter. There is also an increase seen in pricing growth (versus last quarter) which would be driven by price hikes in Maggi and coffee. What to look out for in the quarterly show?

Angels vs Launderers: The triumph of innovation over tax burdens,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/expert-columns/angels-vs-launderers-the-triumph-of-innovation-over-tax-burdens-12776336.html,Companies,"July 23, 2024 07:12 PM","By Vikas Gupta, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist The angel tax, introduced by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee in the 2012 budget, was designed to curb money laundering by imposing a hefty 30.9 percent tax on the excess valuation of firms above their fair market value. This measure targeted high valuations, aiming to prevent dubious financial practices. While this approach worked reasonably well for established industries where valuations are more straightforward, it posed significant challenges for innovative startups. For these young, high-growth ventures, the fair market value often falls short of the true potential value of their business, leading to a substantial tax burden that hindered their ability to raise necessary capital. Startups operate in a unique environment where valuations can be highly subjective, driven by future potential rather than current market conditions. The fair market value used to assess the angel tax was often too conservative for these fast-evolving companies. As a result, the tax imposed an undue strain on startups, effectively stifling their growth and innovation by making it more expensive and difficult for them to secure funding. Also read: Middle class homeowners to be hit hardest as FM revokes indexation benefits in property deals The recent decision to abolish the angel tax marks a significant turning point for the startup ecosystem. This policy shift is a major relief for entrepreneurs and investors alike, as it removes a considerable financial burden that previously discouraged investment in high-potential startups. With the tax no longer in place, startups can now raise capital based on valuations that more accurately reflect their current and future worth. This change is particularly important for early-stage companies where valuations are often fluid and speculative, and the removal of this tax enables more realistic and mutually agreed-upon investment terms. The elimination of the angel tax is expected to lead to a substantial increase in accessible capital for startups. Previously, nearly 30 percent of potential investment funds would have been diverted to the government due to the tax, leaving startups with less capital to fuel their growth. Now, with these funds remaining within the startup ecosystem, companies will have more resources to innovate, expand, and drive their businesses forward. This change is likely to lead to a more vibrant and dynamic startup environment, fostering greater entrepreneurial activity and economic growth. Also read: New income tax regime gets sweeter; tax slabs softened, standard deduction hiked For investors, the removal of the angel tax reduces the cost of capital, making investments in startups more attractive. Venture capitalists and angel investors will find it easier to invest in promising startups without the added financial burden of the tax, thereby increasing the number of startups that meet investment criteria. This change should lead to a more robust investment landscape, with increased opportunities for startups to secure funding and achieve their growth objectives. Moreover, the abolition of the angel tax is expected to simplify the investment process by reducing disputes over fair market value assessments and tax implications. Previously, negotiations between startups and investors were complicated by the need to address the tax and determine how it would be shared. With the tax no longer a factor, these negotiations should become more straightforward, facilitating smoother investment transactions and fostering a more collaborative relationship between entrepreneurs and investors. While the immediate impact on startup investment volumes may not be apparent, the long-term benefits of removing the angel tax are significant. By eliminating one of the major barriers to startup investments, this policy change is set to invigorate the startup ecosystem, promoting innovation and supporting the growth of high-potential ventures. It is crucial to recognize that while the reduction in tax burden is beneficial, investment decisions should still be based on the merits of the startups and their potential for creating value, rather than merely on the advantages of tax relief. Overall, the removal of the angel tax represents a major victory for the startup community, providing a more favourable environment for entrepreneurship and investment. This change is expected to contribute to a more vibrant and dynamic startup ecosystem, ultimately driving economic growth and innovation in the years to come.

""Indian steel industry is in discussion with the government.

Separately, Acharya denied the company was in talks with Australian miner Whitehaven Coal for a stake in its Blackwater metallurgical coal mine. Whitehaven in January said it was exploring a potential sell-down of about 20% of Blackwater to global steel producers as strategic joint venture partners. However, JSW Steel continues to look for coking coal assets overseas, including Australia, and Canada, Acharya said. Acharya also said the company was open to importing coking coal from Mongolia but as of now there was ""nothing on the radar"". He also opposed a proposal from the trade remedies body against capping imports of low ash metallurgical coke, a steelmaking fuel. ""Putting any kind of duties on materials which we don't internally have, doesn't make strategic sense,"" Acharya said. Last month, Reuters reported that India's steel ministry also did not favour limits on imports of met coke, citing risks to domestic output.

For months, lenders have been trying to find $533 million in cash that Ravindran allegedly moved out of the US, according to court documents. US Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey held Ravindran in contempt of court for refusing to help track down the money. The missing money is at the heart of a dispute between lenders owed $1.2 billion and the startup founded by entrepreneur Byju Raveendran.

The facility, which will be the fourth Final Assembly Line (FAL) for the single engine H125, will initially produce up to 10 helicopters annually and the capacity will be ramped up depending on the market demand, Airbus officials said. ""India is the market of the future for helicopters... at present, the market is extremely embryonic, it is very small compared to what the potential could be,"" Olivier Michalon, Executive Vice President, Global Business of Airbus Helicopters, said. The ground-breaking ceremony for the FAL is expected in October or November this year and the facility will be operational in 2026 and the delivery is anticipated to start towards the end of 2026. ""We have identified eight sites which we are currently assessing. We are still in the final assessment stage. We should be in a position to announce it shortly. ""We want to be attractive and in an ecosystem that is best suited for industrial activities, logistics, employees and of course, regulations,"" Michalon said at a briefing at Marignane last week. Marignane is the headquarters of Airbus Helicopters. For Airbus, H125 is the most-sold helicopter in India as well as the South Asia region. Airbus has projected the demand for H125 helicopters in India and neighbouring countries at 500 over the next 20 years. ""We are targeting 10 helicopters per year and as the demand picks up we can ramp up,"" Head of Airbus Helicopters in India and South Asia Sunny Guglani said at the briefing. Michalon stressed that 10 might not sound like a lot and it could be 20, 30, or 50 in some years, depending on the market demand. ""We manufacture, sell and support helicopters. Also, we manufacture, sell and support solutions. This is what we can provide. Make In India solutions,"" he said. Highlighting the success story of its narrow-body A320 aircraft, Michalon said, ""H125 is our A320"". H125 can carry up to six people. Airbus is also setting up the FAL for the C295 aircraft in Vadodara, Gujarat. There are around 350 civil and parapublic helicopters in India and South Asia (India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Maldives). Out of them, less than 250 helicopters are in service in India, as per Airbus. In India, there are about 100 Airbus helicopters, with the majority of them being H125 and 130s. There are more than 4,300 H125 helicopters flying around the world. ""The FAL in India will not only make us competitive in terms of lead time, delivery time, it will also help us address the growth of the Indian market and possibly the demand from neighbouring nations. ""This is an important, strategic decision and it will have an impact on our global footprint,"" Michalon said. A basic model of a H125 helicopter could cost around 3.2 million euros, according to a company official. In India, helicopters are used for tourism, pilgrimage, and medical services as well as by the energy sector and private entities. Once set up in India, the FAL for H125 helicopters will undertake the integration of the major component assemblies, avionics and mission systems, installation of electrical harnesses, hydraulic circuits, flight controls, dynamic components, fuel system and the engine. Besides, the FAL will do testing, qualification, and delivery of the H125 to customers in India and the region. About the Indian market, Michalon said the regulations are a bit restrictive but the company is working as if those regulations are going to lighten up a bit and the skies become more open. ""Either we wait for the skies to be fully open and then it is a big rush by all helicopter manufacturers or we demonstrate our trust and recognition potential of India and be ready to invest,"" he said. In January, Airbus and Tata Group announced a partnership to set up India's first helicopter FAL in the private sector. The facility will be set up by Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL), along with Airbus Helicopters.

According to a Moneycontrol poll of nine brokerages, Hindustan Unilever is likely to report a flat revenue growth, higher by one percent on-year at Rs 15,205 crore. Net profit is likely to come in at Rs 2,512 crore versus Rs 2,500 crore seen in the corresponding quarter last year.  Earnings estimates of analysts polled by Moneycontrol are in a narrow range, and any positive or negative surprise may trigger a sharp reaction in the stock. The most optimistic estimate sees India’s largest consumer staples firm HUL’s net profit jumping five percent on-year, but the most pessimistic projection suggests that net profit might sink five percent, such has been the divergence. Factors Impacting the Earnings HUL's revenue is likely to remain flat on account of subdued performance across categories, mainly impacted by price cuts, said Axis Securities. Volume Growth: The overall demand for HUL's products is seen muted in Q1FY25, with underlying volume growth seen in single-digits, according to brokerages. However, volumes in 75 percent of HUL’s business are growing. The FMCG major is likely to boost its volume growth in FY25 and FY26, said Motilal Oswal. Segmental Performance: Across segments, the performance is likely to vary with HUL's home care business likely growing at two percent, while beauty and personal care revenue expected to fall because of price cuts. HUL's Food portfolio, especially tea, coffee, and functional nutrition drinks, may be affected by a tough summer. Prabhudas Lilladher said, “We expect strong performance in Laundry while OOH consumption and hot beverages might be weak.” EBITDA margins: While gross margins are expected to expand in the range of 120-160 basis points, while HUL’s EBITDA margin is likely to contract by 10 basis points due to higher advertisement spends, royalty payout, and the termination of GSK consignment sale. What to Look Out For? Analysts will closely monitor demand in metro areas and tier-3 towns, the effect of raw material prices on EBITDA margins, as well as the growing competitive pressure from unorganized players.

""This was under tranche two forward auction held on 9th July by the Ministry of Mines,"" it said. The company won the bid quoting a mining premium of 150.05 per cent of the value of mineral despatch, which it would pay to the state. CIL will formally receive the letter of intent once it deposits performance security. Further, a composite license will be issued to CIL in a year after the company meets the formalities under the notice inviting tender timeline. The block was put for sale in the second tranche of the critical mine auction. ""CIL under its diversification portfolio won the bid. With this, CIL is poised to play a supporting role in critical minerals domestically,"" it said. The country imports about 69 per cent of its graphite needs - natural, synthetic and end-use products. Currently, the graphite mining industry has limited players, offering space for willing players to venture into this business arena. Graphite has its utility as an anode material in lithium-ion battery manufacturing due to its relatively low cost and energy density. With the electric vehicle market and energy storage systems fast gaining traction, where lithium-ion cells are used, graphite has a big market. The market size for graphite is projected to take a big leap with the absolute demand projected to shoot up at the rate of 25-27 per cent by FY35 from the current level. The PSU had earlier said it is mulling the mining of critical minerals.

Byju's founder faces reckoning as startup implodes,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/byjus-founder-faces-reckoning-as-startup-implodes-12774162.html,Companies,"July 22, 2024 08:01 AM","Byju Raveendran, an Indian mathematics whiz who soared from teacher to startup billionaire before his education-technology company imploded this year, now faces his biggest test. The future of Raveendran's eponymous Byju's online coaching firm rests with India's courts after the county's biggest startup, once loved by global investors who valued it at $22 billion, crashed below $2 billion in valuation. The 44-year-old founder last week lost control of the company as a tribunal kick-started an insolvency process. Accused of ""financial mismanagement and compliance issues"", the son of a family of teachers from a small village in south India faces a reckoning that will test the ingenuity that made him a poster child for India's startups. His formerly high-flying company was eventually brought low when it could not pay $19 million in sponsorship dues to India's cricket federation, prompting a tribunal to suspend Byju's board and make Raveendran report to a court-appointed restructuring expert. An appeals tribunal is expected to hold a hearing on Monday on whether Byju's insolvency process should be quashed after the former billionaire argued in court his company is solvent and that insolvency could shut it down and cost the jobs of 27,000 staff, including teachers. Insolvency also would not bode well for Byju's backers, such as Dutch technology investor Prosus. Raveendran denies the allegations of mismanagement and wrongdoing at his firm, which has in recent months faced lawsuits over unpaid loans and boardroom battles with foreign investors that went public. Potential insolvency is a dramatic turn of events for an entrepreneur described by one person who has worked with him as an extremely passionate and goal-oriented person who might adopt ""an abrasive approach"" in a crisis. Raveendran presented a ""suave, nice and polished"" image, appearing to heed advice, but ""eventually there was a trust deficit"", said another executive who quit last year as a Byju's senior vice president. ""He said things are improving, don't worry, we have the money,"" the former executive said. Raveendran and a Byju's spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment. BYJU'S DOWNFALL: 'OUR FAIR SHARE OF MISTAKES' An engineer by training, he started Byju's in 2011 with physical classes after friends urged him to go into teaching. Raveendran, who aced a premier Indian management exam ""with a score of 100 percentile, not once but twice"", according to the company website, started what would become his empire with his wife Divya Gokulnath, 38, a former student of his. In education-obsessed India, Raveendran hit gold by offering online teaching programs priced from $100 to $300. He got a mammoth boost when the COVID-19 pandemic sent students indoors. At the height of his fame in 2021, he and his wife had a net worth of $4 billion, Forbes reckoned. Now all that is in tatters. Behind the reversal of Byju's meteoric success, say executives and advisers who worked with Raveendran, is that he overruled associates and expanded the business through expensive acquisitions, splurging on marketing and being slow to address problems such as sales agents adopting aggressive tactics to mis-sell courses that damaged the company's reputation. With the backing of investors like General Atlantic, Prosus and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's philanthropy venture, Raveendran spent millions on acquisitions, and the company says it has 150 million students in over 100 countries. ""While growing fast, as I've accepted multiple times, we've made our fair share of mistakes"", Raveendran told an interviewer last year at the World Economic Forum in Davos. As he battled crises, the CEO also said decisions to lay off some of its then-50,000 employees and slash branding expenses would help strengthen loss-making Byju's and turn its cashflow positive. ""Every country needs a Byju's,"" he said.

Suzuki sees India’s automobile market growing fivefold by 2047,https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/auto/suzuki-sees-indias-automobile-market-growing-fivefold-by-2047-article-12774147.html,Companies,"July 22, 2024 07:29 AM","India’s car market is on track to reach 20 million units by 2047, helped by promising growth in battery electric vehicles, Suzuki Motor Corp. Executive Vice President Kenichi Ayukawa said. First, the goal is for Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., the Japanese carmaker’s subsidiary, to grab 50% market share by 2030, from around 40% for the fiscal year through March. “We’re confident that the Indian market will expand in the mid to long term,” Ayukawa said in an interview. The emergence of India as an economic powerhouse and its expanding middle class present a clear opportunity for the Hamamatsu-based manufacturer, which has been active in the South Asian nation since 1983 and has found success as the top-selling automaker with models such as Swift and Brezza. In order to keep its lead, Suzuki plans to introduce its first-ever EV in India, as well as in Europe, next year after exhibiting its mass production model at the upcoming auto expo in India in January, according to Ayukawa. “We’ll develop products, invest and expand our network,” Ayukawa said. A total of 4.2 million passenger vehicles were sold in India in the fiscal year ended in March, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. To put that number — and Ayukawa’s prediction — in perspective, 3.1 million passenger cars were sold in the US last year, while Europe saw 15 million in unit sales. China is the world’s largest automobile market with 26 million passenger vehicle sales, according to the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers. Although Suzuki’s planned eVX is a premium electric vehicle, the carmaker will also roll out more affordable and compact models with lighter batteries, according to Ayukawa. Suzuki is targeting 15% of its sales in India to be EVs by 2030, he added. “India faces environmental issues so I think EVs will grow to an extent,” Ayukawa said. Although people are paying more for cars more than they used to, “India remains a price-conscious market,” he added. Even so, car buyers are starting to show greater appetite for crossovers and sport-utility vehicles, according to Ayukawa. Competition is tougher in that segment because it’s a “strong area for Tata and Mahindra,” he said. Tata Motors Ltd., India’s third-biggest carmaker, has already taken the lead in with fully-electric variants of its popular Tiago and Nexon models, and expects its EV business to reach profitability by early 2026. Suzuki will focus on models that can be used for everyday needs, which will require development of new types of batteries, according to Ayukawa. In the future, Suzuki may embark on domestic production of cells in the next 5 to 10 years, he added. As for collaboration in India with Toyota Motor Corp., which forged a strategic partnership with Suzuki in 2019 through a stake of about 5%, Suzuki will likely focus on smaller cars while Toyota will take the lead on bigger models, Ayukawa said. Toyota’s EV technology will also bolster Suzuki’s product development, he added. “We will learn basic know-how from Toyota and gradually make it our own,” Ayukawa said. Suzuki also sees potential in cars powered by compressed natural gas, which is cheaper than gasoline in India, according to Ayukawa. Maruti Suzuki sold 483,000 CNG cars in the latest fiscal period, up 47% from a year earlier. Although Suzuki plans to start operating four plants that convert methane from cow manure into fuel for cars that currently run on CNG, there are challenges ahead, such as monetizing the organic fertilizer that remains after manufacturing the fuel at a large scale, Ayukawa said.

Reliance records resilient operating and financial performance for Q1; here are top 10 key highlights,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/reliance-records-resilient-operating-and-financial-performance-for-q1-here-are-top-10-key-highlights-12773442.html,Companies,"July 19, 2024 10:10 PM","Reliance Industries, which runs businesses spanning oil, telecom, and retail, reported a resilient financial performance in the fiscal first quarter ended June 30, underscoring the strength of its diverse businesses. “Consolidated EBITDA for the quarter improved from a year ago with strong contribution from consumer and upstream businesses offsetting weak O2C (oil-to-chemical) operating environment,” Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director said. Reliance stock gained more than 20 percent year to date to close Friday’s session at Rs 3,110.3 on the NSE. Here are top 10 key highlights: 1) Bottom Line The consolidated profit for the quarter came in at Rs 17,448 crore, declining 4 percent from Rs 18,182 crore net recorded in the corresponding period of previous fiscal. Finance cost increased by 1.4 percent year-on-year to Rs 5,918 crore primarily due to higher interest rates, while depreciation rose by 15.5 percent to Rs 13,596 crore during the same period on expanded asset base across all the businesses, higher network utilisation in digital services business, higher retail store count and ramp-up in upstream production, Reliance said in the filing to exchanges. Tax expenses for the June quarter at Rs 5,786 crore fell by 5.3 percent from Rs 6,112 crore in the year earlier. 2) Top Line The Mukesh Ambani-owned company registered an 11.5 percent on-year growth in gross revenue at Rs 2,57,823 crore for the quarter, on higher oil & product prices and strong growth in oil & gas segment volumes. Steady growth in consumer businesses also contributed to increase in revenue, it said. 3) Operating Performance Consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) for the first quarter of current fiscal year 2025 stood at Rs 42,748 crore, growing 2 percent over the year-ago period, as strong contribution from oil & gas and consumer business offset weak O2C. It reported EBITDA margin for the quarter at 16.6 percent, declining from 18.1 percent in same period previous fiscal. 4) Jio Platforms Jio Platforms, which contributed 13.4 percent to its gross revenue, has started the fiscal year 2025 with profit after tax at Rs 5,698 crore in the June quarter, growing 11.7 percent over a year-ago period, with Jio becoming the largest operator globally in terms of data traffic. Further, the telecom operator continued to build on its market leadership with 33 percent YoY increase in data traffic, while the 5G business accounted for over 31 percent of Jio’s wireless data traffic. “The digital services business registered an impressive financial performance year-on-year, continuing its positive growth momentum,” Mukesh Ambani said. Consolidated revenue increased by 12.8 percent to Rs 34,548 crore during the quarter, with the total subscriber base reaching 48.97 crore (up from 44.85 crore), including 13 crore 5G users. Now, Jio is the largest 5G operator outside China. On the operating front, EBITDA jumped 11.6 percent year-on-year to Rs 14,638 crore primarily due to healthy revenue growth and operating leverage. The margin stood at 49.7 percent for the quarter, against 50.2 percent in the same period previous fiscal. Average revenue per user (ARPU) at Rs 181.7 in Q1FY25 increased from Rs 180.5 in Q1FY24, with better subscriber mix, partially offset by increasing mix of promotional 5G traffic being offered on an unlimited basis to subscribers and not charged separately. 5) Reliance Retail Mukesh Ambani said the retail business delivered robust financial results, as compared to last year, supported by all consumption baskets. Reliance Retail Ventures has registered revenue at Rs 75,615 crore during the first quarter of FY25, increasing by 8.1 percent on-year and profit at Rs 2,549 crore, a 4.6 percent growth. The segment’s EBITDA at Rs 5,664 crore for the quarter grew by 10.5% year-on-year, driven by an increase in footfalls and expansion of store footprint, streamlining of operations driving margin improvement. The margin improved by 30 bps to 8.5 percent during the same period. Reliance said the retail business expanded its store network with 331 new store openings, taking the total store count to 18,918, with footfalls growing 18.9 percent YoY to over 29.6 crore. 6) Oil-to-Chemical The O2C segment, which contributed nearly 61 percent to top line, recorded a 18.1 percent year-on-year growth in revenue at Rs 1.57 lakh crore for the quarter ended June 30, primarily due to higher product prices tracking 9 percent increase in Brent crude oil prices, and higher volumes supported by strong domestic demand. However, its EBITDA was lower by 14.3 percent YoY to Rs 13,093 crore on account of lower gasoline cracks and lower downstream chemical deltas. The margin was at 8.3 percent during the quarter, against 11.5 percent in year-ago period. “The total throughput for the June FY25 quarter increased by half a percent to 19.8 MMT, and the production meant for sale grew by 2.9 percent to 17.7 MMT compared to same period previous fiscal. 7) Oil & Gas The oil and gas segment continued its growth trajectory with higher production, offsetting lower year-on-year gas price realisations, Ambani said. The segment recorded revenue for the quarter at Rs 6,179 crore, a 33.4 percent growth over the corresponding period of last fiscal led by higher volumes partly offset by lower price realisation from KG D6 and CBM field. Reliance said the average price realised for KG D6 gas was $9.27 per MMBTU (metric million British thermal unit) in Q1FY25 against $10.81 per MMBTU in Q1FY24. The average price realised for CBM gas was $11.59 per MMBTU against $14.15 per MMBTU during the same period. The segment’s EBITDA increased by 29.8 percent to Rs 5,210 crore on higher volumes from KG D6. However, margin came in at 84.3 percent against 86.7 percent during the same period. 8) Media Business Reliance said two of the biggest viewer-interest events, IPL and General Elections, helped the media business record one of the strongest quarters for the Network18 Group in terms of consumer reach and engagement. However, revenue from operations was down by 3 percent YoY to Rs 3,141 crore due to IPL revenue being distributed across two quarters this year. The media segment posted loss at Rs 221 crore for the quarter, against profit of Rs 1 crore in year-ago period, while the EBITDA stood at Rs 3 crore against Rs 108 crore during the same period. The IPL 2024 on JioCinema set new viewership benchmarks, reaching 620 million viewers, and News18 was the most tuned-in news network during general elections and on the counting day. 9) Green Energy Reliance has made significant progress on the implementation of New Energy Giga-factories. On completion, these projects will provide India a world-class, integrated green energy ecosystem which can propel the next leg of sustainable growth, Ambani said. 10) Capital Expenditure and Debt Capital expenditure for the quarter ended June FY25 was Rs 28,785 crore, against Rs 39,645 crore in the corresponding period of previous fiscal. The cash and cash equivalents increased to Rs 1.93 lakh crore for June FY25 quarter, from Rs 1.92 lakh crore in June FY24 quarter, while the net debt during the same period dropped to Rs 1.12 lakh crore from Rs 1.26 lakh crore.

On July 19, software updates from American cybersecurity technology firm CrowdStrike triggered a significant disruption in Microsoft Windows services worldwide, causing the infamous “Blue Screen of Death” error on numerous computers. This widespread glitch has led to severe interruptions in various sectors, including aviation, banks, brokerage firms, etc. “We are actually talking to the clients, trying to step up and help them because we are following the Sun model, Europe and US,” Pallia said at a press conference after declaring first quarter results ended June 30. However, Wipro confirmed that the company itself has not faced any issues due to the outage. “We have seen the impact of CrowdStrike, so, all I can say is that, we are running the process to help our clients. We are going by client by client to use CrowdStrike for them,” Pallia further said. CrowdStrike founder and CEO George Kurtz has issued an apology over the disruptive outage that its software update caused to global clients, saying the company is working with each and every customer to bring them back online. Kurtz was speaking to NBC's 'Today' show. Microsoft said that the underlying cause behind the disruption in the Azure cloud service has been fixed. “This is not a security incident or cyberattack,” CEO George Kurtz said. Electronics and Information Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said that the Indian government is in touch with Microsoft and updates are being released to resolve the issue. Meanwhile, the outage caused affected airlines around the world, with several flights being cancelled and grounded. Check-in systems at airports across India, including Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru airports were down causing commotion for passengers on July 19 morning. Airlines, particularly IndiGo, Akasa, and SpiceJet, were affected due to glitch in check-in systems. Later, Delhi airport officials said that check-in counters were back after a three-hour disruption because of the Microsoft issue between 11.30 am to 2.30 pm. IndiGo cancelled 32 flights across India.

"Reliance Industries Q1 earnings: Revenue climbs 11.5%, boosted by telecom, retail, and oil & gas businesses",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/reliance-industries-q1-earnings-revenue-climbs-11-5-boosted-by-telecom-retail-and-oil-gas-businesses-12772226.html,Companies,"July 19, 2024 07:22 PM","Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) reported a 11.5 percent increase in revenue to Rs 2.58 lakh crore in the first quarter of the current fiscal compared to a year ago, bolstered by contributions across segments. Consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) rose 2 percent from a year ago period   to Rs 42,748 crore. The company’s net profit (pre minority) for the quarter ended June 30 dropped 4.5 percent to Rs 17,445 crore, as EBITDA in the oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business declined. Higher depreciation and finance cost also weighed on the bottomline. “Consolidated EBITDA for the quarter improved from a year ago with strong contributions from consumer and upstream businesses offsetting the weak O2C operating environment. Reliance’s resilient operating and financial performance in this quarter underscores the strength of its diverse portfolio of businesses,"" said Reliance Industries’ Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani. RIL's oil and gas business’s EBITDA surged by 30% due to higher production volume. Operating profits for Jio Platforms Ltd and Reliance Retail Ltd rose 11.6% and 10.5%, respectively. Depreciation increased by 15.5% year-on-year to Rs 13,596 crore because of the expanded asset base across all the businesses, higher network utilization in the digital services business, higher retail store count and ramp-up in upstream production.  Finance costs increased by 1.4% year-on-year to Rs 5,918 crore, primarily due to higher interest rates, the company said. According to a Moneycontrol survey, consolidated revenue was expected to increase 12.7 percent from a year earlier to Rs 2.36 lakh crore, while net profit was expected to expand by 0.6 percent to Rs 16,082 crore. Oil and gas business The oil and gas segment’s revenue was 33.4% higher in the first quarter at Rs 6,179 crore mainly on account of higher volumes, partly offset by lower price realisation from the  KG D6 and coal bed methane (CBM) field, the company said in a press release. EBITDA of the oil and gas business rose to Rs 5,210 crore. The segment’s EBITDA margin stood at 84.3%. A 44 percent boost in gas production from the KG D6 field partly offset the impact of lower price realizations. The average production at KGD6 was reported at 28.7 MMSCMD of gas and approximately 21,640 barrels per day of condensate. The average price realised for KG D6 gas was $9.27/MMBTU in the quarter under review, as compared to $10.81/MMBTU in the same period last year. The average price realised for CBM gas was $11.59/MMBTU in Q1, lower than $14.15/MMBTU last year. O2C business RIL’s O2C segment reported growth of 18.1 percent in its revenue to Rs 1.57 lakh crore in the quarter, up from Rs 1.33 lakh crore last year. The oil-to-chemicals (O2C) segment’s EBITDA declined 14.3 percent from a year earlier to Rs 13,093 crore, due to lower transportation fuel cracks—the difference between the price of crude oil and the final product--- and downstream chemical margins. This was partially mitigated by low feedstock costs and robust domestic demand. Sequentially, O2C EBITDA fell 22 percent due to a fall in fuel cracks amid subdued demand and increased supply, although it was cushioned by improved downstream chemical margins. “Overall, energy market volatility is something that we have been seeing for various set of reasons. However, we do think that the structural business dynamics remains constructive,” Chief Financial Officer Srikanth Venkatachari told reporters in a virtual briefing. Jio Platforms Jio Platforms Ltd’s revenue from operations rose 12.8 percent from last year to Rs 29,449 crore in the quarter ended June 30. The segment’s EBITDA increased to Rs 14,638 crore.

The miner, owned by billionaire Anil Agarwal, had in November 2023 regained control of the copper mines and smelter, which the Zambian administration had seized in 2019, but needed to pay creditors of the mines to revive operations. Vedanta Resources gained control of KCM's assets following a five-year legal battle after the former Zambian President Edgar Lungu accused the company of failing to invest to expand copper production and seized its assets. The UK-based company will still need to raise an additional $1 billion to revive the KCM's mining operations and invest in advancing the Konkola deep mining project, which holds one of the richest copper deposits in the world, as per a Reuters report from early July. The Zambian government owns a 20% stake in KCM through ZCCM, a mining investment company, while Vedanta Resources owns the rest. Last month, Anil Agarwal said Vedanta Resources is looking to reduce its debt by $3 billion over the next three years, as the company grapples with mounting debt and a host of rating downgrades since last year.

Companies working to help India meet its net-zero goals will be among the beneficiaries of the foreign capital flows, according to K Balasubramanian, head of corporate banking for Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. “Climate transition is playing out in a big way, likely triggering a bout of foreign fund inflows,” Balasubramanian, known as Bala, said in an interview in Mumbai. India’s government aims to attract $110 billion a year in foreign direct investment over the next seven years as the South Asian nation draws investors looking to diversify away from China. That compares with an annual average of more than $70 billion over the last five years. Bala said capital is flowing into sustainable energy creation strategies like solar, hydrogen and ammonia. On the energy consumption side, electric vehicles are the “real big story,” he said. “Every formidable company is nurturing plans to enter the next generation iteration on electric mobility,” Bala said.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has cast himself as a climate champion, and India has made significant investments in clean energy, adding more than 100 gigawatts of capacity in the last 10 years. The country has pledged to install 500 GW of non-fossil fuel energy by the end of the decade, and aims to secure $1 trillion in investments in solar power to meet its 2070 net-zero pledge. India has a 181 billion rupees ($2.2 billion) incentive program to manufacture electric-vehicle batteries in the country. Reliance Industries Ltd., JSW Neo Energy Ltd., and Ola Electric Mobility Pvt. are among the companies selected to produce battery capacity and avail incentives under the program. Apart from climate transition, India’s forays into electronics and infrastructure-related manufacturing are gaining prominence with investors abroad, Bala said. “Capital will come to wherever there are pockets of opportunity in terms of production cost advantage,” Bala said. “Then skill and value addition will be the key drivers for such investments.” India is attracting new groups of investors, according to Bala. Middle-eastern sovereign wealth funds are big backers of energy creation projects, while US investors are drawn to technology and consumption-focused companies. European firms invest in high-end tech, and capital from North Asian countries is making its way to India, Bala said. “In Japan itself, 1,600 companies have identified plans of getting into India, as distributors or suppliers to large companies,” Bala said. The New York-based bank has been ramping up its relationships to become the “first port of call,” for foreign investment, Bala said. These include the US-India corridor, where it gets a majority of the business, he said. The bank is also strong in Germany, France and in the Nordic region, and is spending a lot of time in Taiwan, Bala said.

Analysts had anticipated Infosys to maintain its FY25 revenue growth guidance at 1-3 percent in constant currency (CC) terms. The company had revised its annual revenue growth guidance five times in the last six quarters. The latest was in the March quarter when it slashed guidance to 1-3 percent. The company cited three reasons for its confidence in raising both the upper and lower ends of its revenue guidance. First, a strong June quarter with increased volumes from the financial sector and favorable outcomes in the U.S. Second, exceptionally strong large deal wins. Lastly, the timely closure of the In-tech acquisition. Infosys beat Street estimates on both the topline and bottomline front. Additionally, the financial services vertical was the only major sector to grow. Moreover, Infosys' large deal wins were highest-ever in Q1 with a total contract value (TCV) of $4.1 billion, with 57.6 percent of it being net new. ""We had a very strong Q1, and with that performance, which focused specifically on volumes, financial services in the U.S., that gave us more confidence for the year,"" Chief Executive Officer Salil Parekh said at a press conference after declaring Q1 results. In April, India’s second-largest IT services company announced the acquisition of in-tech, an engineering R&D services provider with a focus on the German automotive industry. The management said this deal was closed on July 17, and performance would reflect in the books of account from Q2. In January, Infosys narrowed revenue growth guidance for the full year to 1.5-2 percent for the full year. The move came after it had previously slashed revenue guidance in September to 1-2.5 percent from 1-3.5 percent. Before that, the company had reduced its revenue guidance for the fiscal to 1-3.5 percent from 4-7 percent, amid an increasingly challenging demand environment.

Budget 2024 – Sanctity of macro preserved without populism!,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/expert-columns/budget-2024-sanctity-of-macro-preserved-without-populism-12780162.html,Economy,"July 28, 2024 07:45 AM","By Hiren Ved, Director & Chief Investment Officer at Alchemy Capital Management At first glance, the budget seemed populist, but it is not! Yes, there is a big push to try and fire up employment but incentivising the private sector to hire more and tackle the big challenge of unemployment given that we need to create 7-8 million new jobs annually. Think of it as a PLI (production linked incentive) for employment generation. How this will be operationalised on the ground is to be seen, but the intent is in the right direction. The moot question in the minds of investors was – what the government will do with the additional Rs 1.4 lakh crore (Rs 1.4 trillion) of resources that it has due to higher RBI dividend and better tax collections? Will it be more populist, or will it increase the allocation for capex and fiscal consolidation? The Finance Minister’s decision to allocate nearly 70 percent of this surplus to reduce the fiscal deficit, and 30 percent to increased transfers to states, while maintaining capex at Rs 11 lakh crore, is prudent. This somewhat anticipated allocation of Rs 0.4 lakh crore to the two states - Bihar and Andhra, both very important allies in the NDA government - can also be construed as an infrastructure stimulus, as this amount will be spent on building infrastructure in these states including power, roads, irrigation, and education. By aggressively bringing down the fiscal deficit to 4.9 percent for FY25 and showing a glide path to 4.5 percent by FY26, is a signal to global rating agencies to upgrade India’s sovereign rating. This strategic move will help in bringing down the cost of capital in India on a long-term structural basis and bring down long term interest rates in the country. From a capital markets perspective, the increase in STCG (Short Term Capital Gains) and LTCG (Long Term Capital Gains) on listed equities was a slight dampener. But one can take comfort from the fact that this was part of a larger design to simplify the capital gains tax on all asset classes – equites both listed and unlisted, debt, gold and real estate. The capital markets will take this in its stride, as it always has, and investors will move on. Given that there was an overwhelming feeling that some regulatory and tax interventions would be taken to curb the excessive speculative fervour in the Futures and Options market, the increase in STT (Securities Transaction Tax) is welcome. There could be more follow up measures like increasing lot sizes and rationalising the expiry days, but once that is done the hanging sword on regulatory interventions would be out of the way, in our view. The budget also introduced several forward thinking and strategic measures aimed at sustainable growth, followed by initiatives with emphasis on R&D and leveraging DPI (Digital Public Infrastructure) in agriculture. For instance, initiatives such as digital soil health cards, precision farming tools and blockchain-based supply chain management systems. These technologies can significantly enhance crop yields, reduce wastage, and improve long-term productivity and efficiency of the agricultural supply chain. This is a strategic shift from traditional MSP (Minimum Support Price) hikes, thereby reducing market distortions & fiscal burdens. Custom duties on several products have been reduced to make Indian manufacturing sector more competitive, notable being a steep reduction in gold and silver with a view to both, discourage smuggling activities that thrive on the arbitrage created by high import taxes. Further, this will not only bring more trade into the formal economy but also seek to enhance the competitiveness of the domestic jewellery sector, making it more attractive for both local consumption and export markets. The reduction in MNC tax rates from 40 percent to 35 percent is to encourage greater investments in India, though that’s not the only reason why MNCs would come to India. On the whole, the budget is well-balanced and disciplined for the Indian economy and should continue to foster growth with more inclusivity… well, until the next budget!

Why the Economic Survey’s suggestion to target non-food inflation is misguided,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/why-the-economic-surveys-suggestion-to-target-non-food-inflation-is-misguided-12779566.html,Economy,"July 26, 2024 04:33 PM","The Economic Survey, released on July 22nd, is an engaging read. It provides many novel data Tables and Boxes. The Chief Economic Adviser Dr V Anantha Nageswaran should be complimented for this Survey. Indeed, a long review of some of its themes is warranted. This article analyzes one specific recommendation that it made – instead of targeting (headline) inflation as at present, India should consider targeting a subset of that i.e. non-food inflation. This subset is close to what is defined as core inflation in USA, i.e. inflation excluding fuel and food, which is their target. Since fuel is only 6.84% of our CPI basket, and retail fuel prices are less volatile in India than in USA due to offsetting changes in fuel taxes, non-food inflation is a suitable measure of core for India. It comprises 60.94% of the CPI now, with the remaining consumer food price index (CFPI) component 39.06%. The CEA’s recommendation has attracted a lot of attention, going by articles in the financial media. Core inflation as a concept gained traction in the US in the 1970s. Following OPEC’s quadrupling of oil prices in 1973, the Bureau of Labour Statistics started reporting it and the Federal Reserve incorporated it into its Greenbook projections and decision making process. To begin with, even for developed countries, one can reject the core inflation concept on various grounds. But that requires historical and statistical evidence and conceptual justifications and even robust, commonsensical arguments, provided elsewhere. Instead, let us examine recent developments. In the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee, since early 2023, strong dissent has centred around the steady drop in non-food or core inflation, from 5.3% last June to 3% this June, and below the RBI’s 4% target since October 2023. By contrast, food inflation has roughly doubled over this period from 4.6% to 9.4%, although somewhat erratically, and headline inflation has inched up this June above 5%. In Chapter 3,  the Economic Survey discusses various measures to contain food supply shocks, starting with governmental buffer stock management, which it does. Another option is export bans. When there is a global shortage or global demand is high,  bans do certainly lower domestic prices, and benefit consumers. Box III.2 (Pg 95) provides details of the dates of the bans and their removals for wheat, non-basmati varieties of rice, and other food items – notably onions. But banning exports create disincentives to produce more. Recommendations to tackle this dilemma are spelt out later in a section titled: how do we let the markets function in the interests of the farmer? Its five recommendations are: ONE: By not banning futures or options markets at the first sign of price spikes. TWO: By involving export bans only under exceptional circumstances. THREE: By re-examining the inflation targeting framework. FOUR: Increasing the Total Net Irrigated Area.                                                     . FIVE: Making farming consistent with climate considerations. The first two suggestions are sensible. The fifth suggestion, which I endorse, is of overwhelming importance. The sixteen line paragraph about it warrants careful reading. However, about the third, the Survey states that since food is a big chunk of the CPI in India, “When central banks target headline inflation, they effectively target food prices.  So when food prices rise, inflation targets come under threat. Therefore the central bank appeals to the government to bring down the increase in the price of food products. That prevents farmers from benefiting from the rise in the terms of trade in their favour. India’s inflation targeting should consider targeting inflation, excluding food.” (emphasis added. Pgs 169-170) To begin with, the Economic Survey should not have made such generic statements: first, that central banks effectively target food prices, and second, that the central bank appeals to the government to bring down food prices. Decades before the RBI started inflation targeting, and even before its top brass became aware of the policy, which started in the early  1990s, the Indian government periodically imposed such bans, without appeals by the RBI. While meant to help consumers, the export ban has badly backfired for onions. Following a quasi ban via a Minimum Export Price from October to December 2023, onions were placed under the Prohibited category upto 31 March 2024.  However, on 22 March the Government extended the ban indefinitely, then later rescinded it in May. By then, the damage to onion farmers had been done, despite political gains from lower onion prices for consumers all across India.  The biggest wholesale onion market in Asia is Lasalgaon in Nashik district.  In the 2019 elections, the BJP’s alliance won 11 out of 13 seats in the onion belt of Maharashtra.  But last month it lost 12 out of 13 seats to the INDIA alliance, a stunning reversal. In Beed constituency, even Pankaja Munde, stalwart BJP leader, lost in her family bastion. (Verdict 2004, Shagun, downtoearth magazine, 5 June 2024) The political tug of war between consumers and farmers will continue to play out. But to suggest targeting non-food inflation to avert any likely export bans is misguided. When food inflation is low and non-food inflation is high, cutting interest rates will initially raise food prices that respond faster to demand side increases. The political response to impose export bans will reduce incentives to produce, thus reducing farm productivity, thereby raising farm prices in the long run, and possibly headline inflation too. Food supply shocks are a genuine problem. But in my opinion, they call for targeting headline inflation of a lower frequency -- say a three year average (RBI Should Specify its Inflation Metric, Indian Express, 2nd December 2014).

"Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | RBI fortifies the banking system, but at a cost",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/moneycontrol-pro-panorama-rbi-fortifies-the-banking-system-but-at-a-cost-12779395.html,Economy,"July 26, 2024 03:49 PM","Dear Reader, The Panorama newsletter is sent to Moneycontrol Pro subscribers on market days. It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of.  “All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.” George Orwell’s Animal Farm might not be behind what the Reserve Bank of India has proposed for banks, but it sure seems to be inspired from the above line. The RBI, in a draft circular on Thursday, has proposed that banks must set aside more reserves from April 1, 2025, towards liquidity coverage ratio against deposits that have a digital enabler attached. Simply put, the term deposit you opened through a few clicks online and your savings account that allows you to scan and pay through UPI, will need your bank to invest more in government securities. But the deposit your boomer parent opened by walking to the nearest branch and getting the physical certificate will be termed as less of a flight risk for the bank. So much for chest thumping over digital prowess. It is not that the RBI doesn’t want banks to become digital power houses and offer the best to their customers. In fact, its recent spree of penalties and business restrictions on big lenders to punish them for digital lapses shows otherwise. What the banking regulator simply wants is for banks to take a lesson from the SVB debacle in the US. Silicon Valley Bank went bust in record time after a run on it where most depositors withdrew money online within minutes. That is the power of digital banking services. It can bring unparalleled convenience to people and unprecedented pain to banks during tough times. While SVB has been termed as an isolated case because of its clientele, it holds significant lessons for bankers everywhere. India’s banks cannot go back to long time overruns in their core business if they must keep up with modern technology. Given that UPI has taken Indians leaps ahead, banks must safeguard themselves from situations where a run on them would be lethal. To that extent, the RBI’s proposed norms are sound. It recognizes the transformed nature of banking today and has updated regulation to cater to new challenges. After all, misinformation through social media is rampant and even a not-so-troubled bank can quickly be pushed to its demise through runs instigated by fake news. That does not mean banks have to like it or even their investors. Banking stocks came under pressure today because setting aside more reserves would mean having less money to lend. That would automatically tighten credit and leave banks with less to lend. ICRA analysts estimate that the revised LCR requirements will be Rs 4 trillion for the banking system, a huge number to be set aside. The high credit-to-deposit ratio that has been bothering the RBI for quite some time will now come down. Banks will not only have less money to lend, but the high quality liquid assets that they must keep under LCR are those that offer low returns such as government bonds. That means not just less credit offtake but also more money into low margin assets. Ergo, analysts are pencilling in further contraction in net interest margins for banks, at a time when NIMs are already shrinking. “Banks do carry buffers over LCR norms, but to maintain current levels they may need to increase deposit growth/trim loan growth, which could affect earnings by 4-10%, with a higher impact on PSU banks,” note analysts from Jefferies in their report. What are the options for banks? Crank up the fight for deposits to keep up with credit growth? Kotak Institutional Equities believes that would be unnecessary. “Banks can rebuild to a higher ratio over time rather than looking to comply immediately in 1QFY26 as they would need 3-4 percent points of retail deposits in this challenging deposit mobilization period,” they wrote. Chasing deposits that are already hard to come by through interest rate hikes would be a NIM hara-kiri. The intended outcome is to build a robust banking system that would be able to withstand deposit runs in a digital world. But the unintended consequences have to be taken into stride by the RBI. Those are the short-term big hit on banks’ earnings (which is really not a concern for the regulator) and the extra demand for government bonds (which is actually very good). We know how Animal farm ended. But in the RBI’s case, the outcome is bound to be much better by way of a more fortified banking system.Investing insights from our research team Weekly Tactical Pick: Should you check into this hotel stock?  The Union Budget does not alter the investment case for gold Tech Mahindra Q1 FY25 – great start to a turnaround year Nestle India: Weak consumer sentiment weighs on earnings MC Pro Quick Take | Ashok Leyland Q1 FY25: Strong volume growth, positive outlook Cyient: Below-par show in Q1 FY25, weak FY25 outlook PG Electroplast – Running at full throttle What else are we reading?

Capital gains tax structure changes will help IFSC,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/capital-gains-tax-structure-changes-will-help-ifsc-12779069.html,Economy,"July 26, 2024 11:15 AM","The union budget’s proposals on capital gains tax structure has potentially a significant impact on foreign portfolio investors and the attractiveness of India’s international financial services centre (IFSC). The likely fallout are as follows. FPIs The proposals seek to increase the capital gains tax rates on listed equity shares from 10 percent to 12.5 percent and from 15 percent to 20 percent for long term capital gains and short term capital gains, respectively. The higher rates are applicable for all transfers of listed shares from today onwards. The increase in tax rates could potentially impact NAVs of offshore FPIs that provide for tax on accrued gains. IFSC IFSC is emerging as an important destination for Fund Managers to set up funds, especially to raise monies from offshore investors for investing in capital markets. Currently, there is a separate tax regime for Category III Alternative Investment Funds set up in IFSC which is broadly comparable to taxation regime for offshore Funds set up in jurisdictions such as Singapore and Mauritius. To provide further impetus to Funds in IFSC, it is proposed to extend the same regime to retail schemes and ETFs set up in IFSC (currently, there is no separate tax regime for such Funds in IFSC). With this announcement, Fund Managers may want to explore the setting up of retail schemes and ETFs in IFSC. The reduction in the long term capital gains tax rates from 20 percent to 12.5 percent and the period of holding to qualify as ""long term"" to twenty four months would help outbound Funds set up in IFSC which are raising monies from resident investors for investing outside India. Finance companies/global treasury centres set up in IFSC are eligible for a 10-year ""tax holiday"" (to be availed within 15 years from their date of registration with the IFSCA). There are ""thin capitalisation"" norms in the tax law that restrict the deduction of interest paid to 30 percent of EBIDTA. Domestic NBFCs were excluded from these norms. It is proposed to extend the benefit to finance companies (subject to conditions to be prescribed) set up in IFSC (relevant for non-""tax holiday"" period). This will encourage setting up of finance companies in IFSC for cross-border funding.

RBI's proposed liquidity norms to raise demand for bonds,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/rbis-proposed-liquidity-norms-to-raise-demand-for-bonds-12779002.html,Economy,"July 26, 2024 10:24 AM","The Reserve Bank of India's latest draft guidelines aimed at enhancing the liquidity resilience of lenders, amidst an increased use of digital infrastructure, are expected to boost demand for government bonds over the medium term, traders said. Late on Thursday, the central bank proposed that banks apply an additional 5% reduction in the stability of retail deposits that have internet and mobile banking access. If finalised, the norms would be applicable from April 1, 2025. ""Given the significant penetration of internet and mobile banking, the proposed changes are likely to increase the outflows in the next 30 day bucket for banks, thereby posing higher requirements of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA),"" Anil Gupta, senior vice president and co-group head financial sector ratings at ICRA said. Liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) is a certain proportion of HQLA that banks need to maintain at all times. It includes cash, reserves with central banks, and federal government bonds, which can easily be converted into cash. The new norms will pose requirements for higher liquid assets for the banks to shore up their LCRs. Banks are likely to add government bonds in the run up to the implementation of these guidelines, Gupta added. The norms also suggest that government bonds would be valued at an amount not greater than their current market value, adjusted for applicable haircuts in line with the margin requirements under the liquidity adjustment facility and marginal standing facility. ""The additional haircut owing to internet enabled transaction facility has arisen from recent global experiences of run offs... These steps add to the withdrawal of accommodation stance as far as liquidity with banks is concerned,"" said Alok Singh, group head of treasury at CSB Bank. However, traders said that there may not be an immediate impact as far as government bond yields are concerned as the said circular will come into effect later. State-run banks are already holding assets more than what regulatory norms need, but traders said some private banks may have to shore up holdings which could push up demand for bonds at a later stage. ""In such a case, demand for shorter duration bonds would pick-up further,"" said VRC Reddy, treasury head at Karur Vysya Bank.

Capital gains rationalisation is fine but there’s a reason for the backlash,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/capital-gains-rationalisation-is-fine-but-theres-a-reason-for-the-backlash-12778301.html,Economy,"July 26, 2024 08:14 AM","By Sudhir Kapadia  The topic which has generated maximum heat and dust in Budget 2024 has been the capital gains tax proposals. To be sure, before every Budget over the years, there would be widespread discussion and debate on the need and nature of changes required to be made in respect of capital gains tax provisions. It is also obvious that there would be some level of asymmetry of thought amongst relevant stakeholders on any kind of changes attempted in the area of capital gains tax depending upon their individual interests. Undoubtedly, even much before the advent and subsequent scorching growth in investments in modern financial products like mutual funds, PMS, and AIFs, the provisions of capital gains taxation in India have been highly complex and contentious. Simultaneously, political parties, economists, professionals and academicians alike have periodically showered their wisdom on the ideal capital gains tax system for India and not infrequently, with inconsistent positions guided by expediency. In this heady mixture of proliferation of capital market products, robust growth in capital gains due to sustained high levels of stock market valuations and plethora of piecemeal tinkering of provisions over the years, any attempt to simplify and rationalise capital gains tax provisions must be applauded and supported. The background and design principle of the changes have been well explained in the Memorandum to Finance Bill 2024 and subsequent FAQs. So the question which needs focus and attention is simple - why has there been so much angst and backlash rather than applause for the attempt to rationalise and simplify the capital gains tax structure in Budget 2024? Anatomy of capital gains restructuring Firstly, there will be only two holding periods - 12 months and 24 months for determining whether the capital gains is short term or long term. For all listed securities, the holding period will be 12 months and for all other assets, it shall be 24 months. Thus, units of listed business trusts (REITs and InvITs) will now be at par with listed equity shares at 12 months instead of earlier 36 months. The holding period for bonds, debentures, and gold will reduce from 36 to 24 months. For unlisted shares and real estate it shall remain at 24 months. Secondly, the rate of short term capital gains on STT paid equity shares, units of equity oriented mutual funds and units of a business trust will increase from 15 percent to 20 percent ‘as the present rate is too low and the benefit from such low rate is flowing largely to high net worth individuals’. The rate of long-term capital gains will be 12.5 percent for all categories of assets. Thirdly, along with this reduced rate, benefit of indexation to calculate adjusted purchase price which is presently available for property, gold and other unlisted assets, will no longer be available. ‘This will ease computation of capital gains for the taxpayer and tax administration’.  Further, ‘for the benefit of lower and middle income classes’, the exemption limit of long term capital gains will be increased from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1.25 lakh. Where is the data? To begin with, the assertions made about the benefit of lower rate of 15 percent on short term capital gains flowing largely to high net worth individuals needs deeper scrutiny and analysis. There have been various data shared by market regulators and participants suggesting a broader and deeper proliferation of investors across the country beyond Tier 1 cities and increasingly encompassing middle class people. Thus, the foundational basis for the rate increase needs more empirical data, which if available with government authorities, should be shared in public domain to buttress this rationale. For the same reasons, a modest increase in exemption limit to Rs 1.25 lakh for long term capital gains seems unlikely to provide any material benefit to the middle classes as the frequency and growth in SIPs and investments in equity oriented mutual funds would suggest far greater number of investors falling way above the enhanced exemption limit. Indexation can’t be based on a template Next is the question of ‘retroactive’ application of the prospective removal of indexation benefit for assets like real estate albeit at the lower rate of 12.5 percent. Whilst Ministry of Finance officials have taken pains to clarify its impact, the fact of the matter is that these clarifications are purely theoretical in nature as the application of the new basis of taxation will significantly differ across myriad factual situations across the country. This is illustrated by the following typical example in a city like Mumbai:-  Thus, there is a steep increase of Rs 74 lakh for the taxpayer in the above scenario. Given the rapid pace of redevelopment of old properties in cities across India, it is not unusual for middle class home owners to monetise their older properties and create a safety retirement corpus with the liquid funds generation and these cases will be adversely impacted by the change in computation mechanism. Let us take another example of investment in debt oriented mutual funds (like PSU and Bank Debt Fund) subscribed in 2020/2021 during the pandemic years.  A typical example of this type of investment is given below:-  Since investments in debt oriented mutual funds made before 1st April 2023 were ‘grandfathered’ in Budget of 2023, many middle class investors who would be holding these kinds of debt mutual funds purchased earlier will now discover, to their dismay, that their returns are further diminished due to the additional tax outgo. An alternative approach It is eminently desirable to provide an option to taxpayers to calculate their long-term capital gains tax liability on real estate, gold and other unlisted​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ assets under either higher rate of 20 percent (with indexation) or lower rate of 12.5 percent (without indexation) rather than force a potentially more detrimental scheme (like in cases outlined above) on a taxpayer. The reason adduced for removing indexation benefit namely, ‘complexity in computation of capital gains’ seems rather tenuous as this computation mechanism has stood the test of time over the decades and there doesn't appear to be any serious disputes on the computation methodology. As per post budget clarifications, it appears that the incremental tax revenues on account of these capital gains tax changes are a relatively modest Rs 15,000 crores. Therefore, government should seriously consider restricting the changes to the laudable simplification in definition of holding period (12 and 24 months across all asset classes) without any need to increase either the short term or long term tax rates on listed securities. Under this scenario the higher rate of 20 percent (with indexation benefits) can be retained for gold, real estate and other unlisted assets. Government should consider a more comprehensive​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ feedback mechanism from all stakeholders and defer any changes in capital gains tax scheme till the larger simplification of the tax laws as announced by Finance Minister is undertaken.

New subscriptions to the Employees’ Provident Fund scheme rose 5.8 percent in April compared with the previous month to 984,681, while subscriptions to the Employees’ State Insurance Scheme, which caters to relatively lower-paid employees, jumped 40 percent to 1.7 million, as per the report released by the ministry of statistics and programme implementation.  The rise in employment bodes well for the economy. Private survey data has been hinting at improving employment prospects in the first quarter, after a tepid growth in the previous year. The number of private employees joining the National Pension Scheme rose 108 percent to 21,299 from 10,250 during this period. The National Pension Scheme’s overall subscriptions, however, fell as state subscriptions to NPS declined 54 percent in May compared with the previous month. The total subscriptions to the scheme were 28.5 percent lower at 79,080. Further analysis shows that women employment grew slower than male employment during this period. In the case of EPF, the number of new subscriptions fell by 4.6 percent, while male subscriptions grew by 9.8 percent. For ESIC, women subscriber addition at 31.9 percent was lower than male subscribers at 43 percent.

Indian banks selling retail loan portfolios as deposits lag,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/indian-banks-selling-retail-loan-portfolios-as-deposits-lag-12778191.html,Economy,"July 25, 2024 02:13 PM","India’s private banks are selling portfolios of retail loans as regulators pressure them to improve credit-deposit ratios. India’s largest lender, HDFC Bank Ltd., sold a 50 billion rupee ($597 million) loan portfolio to an undisclosed buyer in June, Chief Financial Officer Srinivasan Vaidyanathan said in a post-earnings media call last week. “We did see a good amount of interest in the market,” he said, noting the bank had last done such a transaction more than a decade ago. “It’s just a beginning,” and “at appropriate price points we will keep doing it,” he added. IDFC First Bank Ltd. sold a basket of unsecured retail loans to Citigroup Inc. in a securitization deal worth 6 billion to 7 billion rupees at the beginning of the year, according to people familiar with the plans who asked not to be named because the information is private. IDFC “will be happy to entertain more such transactions”, said Paritosh Mathur, its head of wholesale banking, without confirming the size or timing of the transaction. The deal won a AAA rating, Mathur said, due to the “high performance of our asset portfolio.” Sales of retail loan portfolios by private banks have been uncommon in India, but several of them are now exploring deals to improve their CD ratios given the success of HDFC’s transaction, according to the people familiar. Private lenders are discussing loan portfolio sales with foreign banks, state-backed lenders, debt mutual funds and insurance companies, said the people. Citi executed its first securitization financing with a digital lender, Navi Finserve, last year, according to a post on the LinkedIn page of K Balasubramanian, head of corporate banking for South Asia. A spokesperson for Citi declined to comment. The Reserve Bank of India is concerned about the increase in credit deposit ratios, a measure of how much of a bank’s deposits are being lent out. Bank deposits grew 11.1% annually through June 28, outpaced by loan growth of 17.4%, the latest RBI data show. The “gap between credit and deposit growth rates warrants a rethink by the boards of banks to re-strategize their business plans,” the Reserve Bank of India said in a monthly bulletin last month. “A prudent balance between assets and liabilities has to be maintained,” it said. The market is also applying pressure to some Indian banks on their loan books. Shares of Axis Bank Ltd fell Thursday following first-quarter earnings that missed estimates on worsening asset quality.

The representatives of the Indian Sugar & Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA) met with Food Minister Pralhad Joshi to discuss a policy framework for the transition, which would expand beyond current ethanol, bioelectricity, and biogas production, a statement said. ISMA Director General Deepak Ballani said the initiative would help India meet international aviation blending targets set to take effect in 2027 under CORSIA mandates while supporting the country's net-zero and self-reliance goals. ""We see a future where local resources drive national development,"" Ballani said in the statement adding that ""This aligns with the government's vision for a self-reliant India."" The plan aims to create alternative markets for India's estimated 55 million sugarcane farmers, building on the success of the current ethanol blending programme in increasing farmer incomes. The government launched 400 E-100 fuel pumps last year. Joshi stressed the need to promote E-100 use, particularly given India's leadership of the Global Biofuels Alliance. ISMA pledged to work closely with the government on the swift implementation of the bio-refinery plan, which is expected to set new benchmarks in the sector and strengthen India's energy security.

Foreigners sell nearly $1 billion in Indian equities in two days since budget,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/foreigners-sell-nearly-1-billion-in-indian-equities-in-two-days-since-budget-12778064.html,Economy,"July 25, 2024 12:43 PM","Foreign investors sold nearly $1 billion worth of Indian equities in the two days since the government raised taxes on derivatives trades and on capital gains from equity investments in its annual budget. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) net sold shares worth 81.06 billion rupees ($968 million) on Tuesday and Wednesday, provisional data from the National Stock Exchange showed. These investors, anticipating the budget, had bought equities worth a net amount of $2.20 billion in six sessions before the presentation on Tuesday. They have invested a net $5.1 billion so far this year. The increase in capital gains tax is clearly a negative even if the increase on long-term gains is moderate, said Ashish Gupta, chief investment officer at Axis Mutual Fund. Uncertainty over whether the long-term capital gains tax rate of 12.5% could go up further creates pressure for the market, he added. ""Long term, we do not see much of an impact since the growth story remains intact and companies continue to grow."" India's benchmark indexes Nifty 50 and Sensex gained about 2% during the pre-budget FPI buying spree. They had risen about 3% between July 11 and July 18, but a 1% drop due to a global cyber outage on July 19 trimmed the gains. Since the budget, the indexes have shed about 1%. Sectors in which FPIs have more holdings - financial services, banks and private banks - fell about 3% each. However, domestic institutional investors have remained buyers, investing a net $0.55 billion since the budget. The impact of the tax changes went beyond equities, as the rupee fell to record lows on both the budget day and Wednesday amid a souring sentiment. The tax changes are intended to discourage ""excessive speculation"" in the derivatives market and encourage long-term investment, a top finance ministry official told Reuters. ""Moving activity from the derivative segment to the cash segment and moving it from short-term speculation to long-term investment are objectives which the government has in mind and some of our tax changes are done with those objectives in mind,"" T.V.

The rupee was quoting at 83.7075 as of 10:54 a.m. IST, holding near the all-time low of 83.72 hit on Wednesday. The currency's trading range has slightly weakened to 83.40-83.70 this month, from the 83.0-83.5 range it held for a large part of the first half of the year, BofA pointed out. The RBI has been holding the rupee in a narrow range via a two-sided intervention -- by absorbing inflows to boost forex reserves and, as it did this week, selling dollars to support the currency. ""We see no sign of change in (the) RBI's pursuit of a higher reserves buffer, which would limit the appreciation potential for INR,"" BofA said. The RBI's dual-sided intervention has kept the rupee's volatility in check relative to historical levels. ""Over the medium term, it would be prudent for the RBI to allow higher volatility in INR. Along with the policy of building a large reserves buffer, that could create more asymmetric risks for trend INR depreciation,"" BofA said.

Agarwal said GST compliance has improved since the tax was introduced in July 2017 and revenue growth has stabilized. That gives the government room to review the rates to simplify the system, he said. Revenue from GST has been steadily rising over the years and increased 11.7% in the fiscal year through March 2024. The collections rose to 1.74 trillion rupees in June. Agarwal said the government intends to simplify the GST structure by taking the existing slabs of 5%, 12%, 18% and 28% and combining it into three rates. The new rates would not impact the revenue collection adversely and the entire exercise “will be done in next few months.” On Tuesday, the government also announced a reduction in the import duty on gold to boost jobs and exports in gems and finished jewelery products. “High duty was leading to smuggling,” Agarwal said, adding that in 2023-24, the department had seized 4.8 tons of gold worth close to 2.9 billion rupees. The tax was imposed when the current account deficit was high, but since it’s manageable now, the government has reduced it to boost the sector, he said. In reference to the 28% GST levied on online gaming last year, Agarwal said the government has collected over 130 billion rupees from the companies since Oct. 2023.

"Finally, getting down to the brass tacks in a budget",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/finally-getting-down-to-the-brass-tacks-in-a-budget-12777321.html,Economy,"July 24, 2024 05:51 PM","The Economic Survey tabled in Parliament on the eve of the Budget presentation, offers an unexpected narrative of the Indian economy. It is a sobering document much in tune with the situation we find ourselves at this juncture. It needs to be read carefully, for its messaging is, I come with a critique and not to praise it. The Chief Economic Advisor deserves kudos for that. Naturally there are obligatory statements about India shining, even as the global economy remains subdued. And indeed at the macro level, we have done well with high real GDP growth and a macroeconomy that is approaching $4 trillion. On understanding complexities For a Survey of its breadth and depth, there are many things one can pick on, but none as quickly as the courageous statement that suggests that ‘few people outside government (living or dead) can understand the complexity of governance in India’ The complexities relate to economic, cultural, geographic, regional and others. Arguably, even within government the understanding of this complexity could be rare. For if such complexities were understood in their entirety, the government would eschew the temptation of making palpably unattainable promises and policy makers would push back against such targets. I am speaking of doubling farmer’s income in five years, increasing employment by 20 million and achieving $2 trillion worth of exports to name just a few. These are obviously political statements and acumen would demand they be appreciated as such. To however, mask the weaknesses of the economy, whether these are structural or cyclical, internal or external, self-inflicted or circumstantial and attribute the challenger’s narrative to a lack of understanding is disingenuous at best and an attempt to divert at worst. It is also unkind to the intelligence of academics, sociologists and economists, historians and demographers among others who spend their time engaging in deep and meaningful research of India and its peoples. The Cambridge economist Joan Robinson who visited India for only a few days but worked on the Indian economy for several years had famously said that whatever you say about India at a point in time, the exact opposite is also true at the same point in time. Many people within and outside government have quoted Joan Robinson no doubt because they agree with that assessment. Economic Survey leads to budget’s core theme Notwithstanding, I feel this year’s Economic Survey has played a crucial role in identifying the several difficulties that confront the Indian economy. Primary among these has been the slow employment creation especially in the formal sector even in the face of fast GDP growth.  The corporate sector has not only done well, but is ‘swimming in profits’. A high growth economy in which 800 million people receive some sort of food subsidy is neither economically nor politically sustainable is the message that is loud and clear in the Survey and to my mind it was the focus of the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s first budget in this election cycle. A thrust for employment creation is writ large in both the Survey and the budget. Development of industrial parks close to cities, reenergizing the smart cities program, bringing back the focus on transit oriented development (ToD), creation of urban rental housing and dormitories are examples of proposals that are aimed to encourage labour intensive manufacturing, possibly the only sensible way to address India’s employment challenge. While the Production Linked Incentive scheme is being reinforced by increasing allocations to sectors such as semiconductor and pharmaceuticals, the budget has buttressed this by an employment linked incentive scheme, or ELI.  The government will provide monetary incentive while the corporate sector would have to train interns or the youth entering the labour market for the first time.  Corporate funding is recommended from their corporate social responsibility pool. This comes on the back of an earlier not so successful scheme to encourage labour intensive employment where the government paid part of the provident fund contribution to first time employees in certain sectors. Multiple channels of enabling job creation The current internship scheme that seeks to train 10 million youth in five years has the potential to unleash the energy of youth in the companies they are placed in. It could create multiplier effects but the proof will naturally lie in the quality of implementation and the keenness of the corporate sector. The job creation agenda is also visible in the proposals to develop religious tourism and tourism in general in the eastern part of the country. Tourism is a labour intensive activity. The enhanced allocations for MSMEs under the Mudra scheme, especially labour intensive manufacturing is another reflection of the focus of employment. The principal message in this budget is to double down on skill and job creation, including for women. The responsibility of this agenda has been placed squarely on the profitable shoulders of India’s private sector. It is interesting that the budget speech did not mention public sector employment, which has remained an aspiration, especially among rural youth. The employment goal will perhaps reverberate and resonate in policy circles for the next five years in this election cycle.  Getting rid of process clutter Simplifying processes in India is work in progress. This budget moves the needle on that. Simplifications have been proposed in tax administration as well as in the bankruptcy code. It is a common occurrence in India that resources, whether tax revenues meant for the government or debt recovery for creditors, these get stuck in endless litigation because of our complex procedures resulting in deadweight losses. Simplification is therefore a welcome step and will get a further boost as the government finalises the economic policy framework in the next six months. These next generation reforms seek to cover all factors of production, namely land, labour, capital and entrepreneurship, and use technology as an enabler for improving total factor productivity and bridging inequality. Effective implementation of several of these reforms requires collaboration between the Centre and the states and building consensus, since development of the country is inextricably linked with development of states. Federalism, cooperative and otherwise The competitive and cooperative federalism that was the hallmark of several budgets between 2014 and 2019 has remained on paper except for the implementation of GST, which according to Arvind Subramanian, former CEA, was a monumental achievement in cooperative federalism. The Survey too emphasises the need for harmonisation across levels of government and across different policies between and within sectors.  Agriculture has been mentioned as a case in point in which subsidies to water electricity and fertilizers coexist with minimum support prices and export bans from time to time. These policies conflict and create rents, damaging the economic fabric. Inverted duty structures are also prevalent, creating policy conflicts that the FM has promised to address in the next six months. A budget to counter narratives  The fiscal consolidation agenda remains on track with a windfall from the RBI and higher than expected tax revenues. The middle class have received a little respite in tax liabilities but those investing in stocks and other assets will have to pay long-term capital gains of 12.5%. Incentives for the poor, tax breaks for the middle class and additional taxes for the rich in the budget seek to moderate the narrative that the rich are getting richer while the poor are finding it difficult to catch up. The budget is however only a start. It is not taxing the rich more that will address the problem. As Joseph Schumpeter observed, the market's achievement does not consist in providing silk stockings for queens but in bringing them within reach of factory girls. And the only way that can happen is to create productive employment opportunities for India’s burgeoning youth, including women. The budget has made a start. Now, for the follow through.

India budget extends economic momentum to social equity,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/india-budget-extends-economic-momentum-to-social-equity-12777204.html,Economy,"July 24, 2024 04:06 PM","By Sudipta Roy   The Union Budget announced today lays down the ‘roadmap for pursuit of Viksit Bharat’ with measures spanning long term macro-economic framework, steps to unlock the potential of agriculture sector, emphasis on creating formal jobs and skill building while focusing on promoting innovation and also outlining the next generation policy framework for sustained and inclusive economic growth. Fast tracking the growth of rural economy has been duly prioritised with policy steps towards both increasing public investment in rural infrastructure and extending policy attention to agricultural and allied activities like horticulture, improvement of supply chains, natural farming, among others. Some specific policy steps like mission to achieve self-sufficiency in pulses and oilseeds, promoting Farmer-Producer Organizations, cooperatives, advancing agricultural productivity through research and natural farming practices and promoting start-ups for vegetable supply chains will bring in quick gains for the overall resilience of the sector. At the same time, steps like policy for development of the cooperative sector or comprehensive review of the agriculture research setup will help address long term issue in the agricultural sector. Efforts to bring in inclusive growth towards a sustainable long-term growth trajectory is commendable. The states lagging in development have been included in a separate development plan encompassing human resource development through skill development, boosting infrastructure, industrial development and generation of economic opportunities to make them drivers of growth in the nation’s growth story. This will not only catalyse industrial development of the eastern region or financial development of the north eastern states but also lay the basic building blocks for inclusive and sustained long term growth path for the economy. The budget has provided a structural boost to consumption by prioritising employment and skill development, especially among the economically weaker sections through a focus on agriculture and welfare sectors. Some of the policy steps in this direction including, Employment linked incentives, scheme for skilling in collaboration with state governments and Industry, upgrading industrial training institutes should help generate productive employment in the non-agricultural sector, particularly in the formal sector. As the outcome of some of these steps get visible on ground, it will prove to be a game changer for sustained demand boost for the economy. The budget also carries a futuristic tone, as it sets up the roadmap for long term vision of developed economy. It covers many critical elements like urban development, energy transition, research and development of small and modular nuclear reactors as future source of energy, partnership with the State governments and multilateral development banks to provide basic services, National Research Fund for basic research and prototype development etc.  The holistic roadmap is further supported by some bold plans for next generation reforms, including digital public infrastructure in agriculture for coverage of farmers and their lands in 3 years, economic policy framework reforms for improving returns to various factors of production etc. While government’s growth focus agenda through CAPEX investment continues, this budget also scores high on fiscal consolidation trajectory. With a market borrowing plan lower than FY24 and fiscal deficit target of 4.9%, govt’s strict adherence to the fiscal glide path continues. That augurs well for the interest rate trajectory and should help crowd in private investment spending. Sudipta Roy, Managing Director & CEO, L&T Finance Ltd.

Chinoy, chief India economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co., told Bloomberg TV’s Menaka Doshi on Wednesday. “Over the next 10 years, India will have huge expenditure obligations.” Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who returned to power last month with a weaker mandate, is under pressure to spend more to shore up voter support and meet the demands of his coalition partners. The federal budget released Tuesday targeted a smaller fiscal deficit for this year on the back of a record dividend from the Reserve Bank of India and a surge in tax revenues. Next year, the government aims to bring down the budget gap even further, which is necessary for India to win a credit rating upgrade. India’s debt is currently rated at the lowest investment-grade level. Chinoy said raising revenue through selling government assets would be more beneficial than raising taxes, which could impinge on demand. “The beauty of asset sales is that its effective like an asset swap, you are selling one asset to build a road or invest in human capital,” he said. The government’s attempts at big-ticket sales of state-run companies have yielded little success, forcing it to scale back its program to small stake offerings through stock exchanges. In the last budget, the government had set a target to raise 500 billion rupees through stake sales by March.

These will arm the lenders in increasing credit flow to the crucial sectors of the economy and optimise outcomes in 3 critical areas — credit expansion, financial inclusion and stressed assets resolution. And the tools used are referred to as the DFM troika, i.e., digital or tech-enabled initiatives, financial inclusion, and MSME (micro, small and medium enterprise) support measures. Digital Initiatives First, technology initiatives in agriculture through successful implementation of the Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) can expand lending to this segment, supported by strengthened underwriting and monitoring to control the traditionally high non-performing assets in the sector. Technology is also expected to contribute to strengthening the recovery ecosystem, with an integrated technology platform to improve implementation of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. This, coupled with other proposed changes, such as strengthening of the tribunal and appellate tribunal, can improve its efficacy from the perspective of both enhancing recovery levels and speeding up the resolution process. Financial Inclusion Two, from an inclusion perspective, the government’s thrust on supporting affordable housing continues with a planned central assistance of Rs 2.2 lakh crore in the next five years. Together with the proposed interest subsidy, this will support growth for companies offering affordable-housing finance. These companies, on the back of a favourable regulatory dispensation and solid underlying demand, have been growing faster than traditional housing finance companies. Further, the proposed 3% interest subvention on education loans to youth currently not eligible for Government benefits should lead to robust growth in the segment. Several other steps focused on women and youth have also been announced. Boost to MSME Sector  Third, and perhaps the most overarching thrust, has been on the MSME front — a number of measures have been proposed to support credit flow to this sector, such as introduction of a credit guarantee scheme for facilitating term loans to MSMEs for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, solidifying credit assessment criteria of MSMEs by public sector banks and providing guarantee from a government-promoted fund to ensure flow of credit to this sector even during stress periods. Further, the role of SIDBI has been enhanced from its hitherto primarily refinance focus to expanding direct lending to MSMEs in addition to raising the limit of MUDRA loans. Also, for facilitating MSMEs to unlock their working capital by converting their trade receivables into cash, the turnover threshold of buyers for mandatory onboarding on the TReDS platform has been reduced. To be sure, today the Indian financial sector is in sound health with strong profitability and comfortable capital buffers. The banking system’s provisioning cover and net non-performing assets are also at their all-time best levels. The measures announced in the Budget are expected to bolster the efforts of the financial sector in supporting overall economic growth by expanding the addressable credit base across various borrower segments, while at the same time supporting lenders’ asset quality. All said, the criticality of the financial sector in achieving the government’s objectives of growth and development is clearly reinforced by the plan for a financial sector vision and strategy document. While the final contours are awaited, this budget is expected to set the agenda for the next five years and provide a framework to guide the efforts of the government, regulators, financial institutions and market participants.

There is not even one announcement in the budget that could be singled out as pandering to the voters’ whims and wishes. Yes, there has been the expected fiscal attention given to Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, but this also has been done with a degree of finesse so as not to derail the continued focus on fiscal consolidation. The majority of allocations to these two states will be arranged as additional resource mobilization with the help of multilateral development banks, presumably as soft interest loans underwritten by the central government. Smart move. Fiscal consolidation will boost private capex revival The fiscal deficit is targeted to be brought down to 4.9% from the earlier estimate of 5.1 percent. Clearly, the government decided not to splurge windfall receipts from the RBI which handed over a dividend income, double the amount assumed in the interim budget. With lower fiscal deficit, and the expected larger supplies of foreign portfolio capital inflows, as India’s weight in international bond indices improves further, we may see a softening of bond yields. This will give the RBI needed confidence to reduce interest rates, which in turn will likely drive greater capital investment by corporates and also by households in real estate. The private investment cycle, already on the upswing, finally, will be reinforced. Four highlights Apart from resisting the ‘rewari’ temptation and, standing firm on fiscal consolidation, there are, among several others, four features that would stand out for positive acclaim for this budget. First, is the government’s admission that employment generation is a top priority and announcing direct measures to try and generate more jobs. The three schemes announced in the budget will incentivize the employers to take on a larger number of workers on their rolls as regular and not contract workers. It is to the credit of the finance minister and her team in North Block that they did not ignore a good suggestion even if the opposition may claim its parentage. Good economics should remain party agnostic. The second positive feature is the emphasis on raising productivity in the agriculture sector and announcing a comprehensive review of the agriculture research establishment. This should yield high returns because at present ICAR’s contribution to making our agriculture globally competitive is rather modest. But for me an even more important feature of the budget is the announcement for targeting an expansion of natural farming package to  one crore farmers over the next two years. This will indeed be a game changer. A paradigm shift is in the making in the Indian agriculture sector, which will surely become an exemplar for other countries. Bravo. The third commendable feature of the budget is its focus on ‘creative redevelopment of cities.’ The budget recognizes that it will be cities, with their dynamism and talent pools, which will drive employment generation and economic growth. The targeting of 14 cities with populations larger than 30 lakh for transit-oriented development; urging the states to reduce stamp duties specially for women house owners; building one crore houses for the urban poor under the PM Awas Yojna; taking the PPP route to build dormitory style housing for industrial workers are all solid initiatives to give the cities their due in driving employment and growth. Finally, the measures announced for ensuring energy security while accelerating the transition to ‘green energy’ are commendable. I am particularly enthused by the allocation for R&D for small modular nuclear reactors as they may be the best substitute for the base load currently provided by coal based power plants.  However, I hope that the government will continue to look for an expeditious introduction of SMNRs through transfer of technology by global private companies, which may have already made substantial advances in this field. Promotion of pump storage for utilizing the seasonally variable power from solar and wind sources is a long awaited move. The encouragement for roof top solar energy with the provision of 300 units of free energy will also help the country minimize its carbon footprint as it increases its energy production by 2-3x in the coming decades. That large increase is required to bring the Indian consumer at par with the global average energy consumption. Features that could have been there Some features that I would have liked to see in the budget include, i) an ambitious target for privatization of public sector enterprises especially now that their market valuations are at sky high; ii) a target for asset monetization which will convert poorly and inefficiently utilized government assets to more productive use. At the same time, revenues from privatization and asset monetization will help reduce the public debt to GDP ratio and reduce the interest pay out, which today swallows as much as 40 percent of tax revenues. iii) a time-bound plan for reducing and eliminating the dysfunctional regulatory and compliance burden specially affecting  the small and medium enterprises who don’t have the wherewithal to establish large government relations departments.  And iv) the finalization of the labour codes that has been going on for the last several years. Hopefully, a time bound plan for this and for minimizing the ‘regulatory cholesterol’ will form a central part of the ‘Economic Policy Framework’ that is expected to be finalized in the next six months. Overall, a well-crafted budget with an eye on the longer term, during which India has to successfully address the substantial twin challenges of accelerating employment generation and reducing its carbon footprint while sustaining a 7-8% rate of economic growth.

"Budgeting for the future, while maintaining fiscal prudence",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/budgeting-for-the-future-while-maintaining-fiscal-prudence-12775950.html,Economy,"July 23, 2024 05:32 PM","The Union Budget announcements revealed significant positives for the Indian financial sector, with relatively larger share of benefits for the marginalized segment of the population. The budget proposals had focused on the growth of the informal sector of the economy by announcing various measures of skill enhancement of youth, credit flow to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and the income enhancement measures for the rural sector. The budgetary proposals shall augment the per capita income and further increase the financial inclusion. The proposals to incentivise domestic higher education though interest subvention and the incentives for addition of jobs in the formal sector could also enhance the growth of formal sectors of the economy. All these announcements are expected to improve the bankability of the population and improve the credit flow through the formal channels in the economy over the medium term. Boost to MSME Sector Given the significant employment generated by the MSME sector and with a focus on alleviating the stress in the MSME sector, a slew of announcements was made to increase the credit flow to MSME sector. The key ones included the Government of India (GoI) guaranteed credit support to overdue MSME borrowers, enhanced limits for MUDRA loans and reduction in turnover limit of the goods buyers from MSMEs for the mandatory onboarding on receivable discounting platform. Further, new credit guarantee scheme for MSMEs in the manufacturing sector for machine purchases and adoption of revamped loan underwriting models by public sector banks for lending to MSMEs are other key announcements which shall improve the credit flow while providing resilience the asset quality of the lenders. To match the increased requirements of skilled labor for the industry, the announcements for youth skilling programme in collaboration with industry coupled with various financial incentives to provide formal employment to the youths are also positive, as they improve the formal jobs in the economy. The housing sector has a multiplier impact on the economy and the continued thrust on PM Awas Yojna (PMAY) with sharp increase in allocations reinforces the housing push by the government. The announcements related to encourage states to reduce stamp duty for purchase of house shall also reduce the cost of ownership of the house. In addition, the announcements for land-related reforms in both rural and urban areas including the digitalization of rural land records and urban bylaws will support mortgage underwriting for the lenders. The reintroduction of the CLSS scheme after a hiatus of one year, which will improve affordability for end-borrowers, augurs well for affordable housing finance companies, as they are likely to see further improvement in demand. Revision of Tax slabs  Buoyed by the increasing adoption of the new individual tax regime, the tax slabs have been revised, which will provide incremental relief provided to the income taxpayers. Supported by additional receipts, the overall gross and net borrowings for FY2025 have been further cut to Rs. 14.01 trillion and 11.63 trillion respectively. While the reduction is lower than our expectations, the announcements also augur well for the overall interest rates in the economy and not crowding-out the private sector fund raisings. The fiscal deficit, in line with our expectations, has been pared to 4.9% of GDP for FY2025 and reiterated at below 4.5% of GDP for FY2026. However, the new medium term fiscal consolidation path linked to reduction in debt/GDP ratio instead of a clear reduction in fiscal deficit/GDP ratio will remain monitorable. PSU Banks Ignored Given the strong performance of public sector banks as well as other government-owned financial institutions, there were no announcements related to capital infusion into these entities, which was entirely in line with our expectations. However, the three public sector general insurance companies getting overlooked once again for capital infusion came as a surprise, as these companies remain severely under-capitalized. With ambitious targets for insurance penetration over the medium term, a significant improvement in the financial health of these companies is the need of the hour. To further strengthen the lenders, the announcements related to appropriate changes to be brought in insolvency and bankruptcy code 2016 and steps to be taken for reforms and strengthening of tribunals, debt recovery tribunals, and appellate tribunals along with establishment of more tribunals shall provide impetus to recoveries and is positive for the asset quality and profitability of the lenders. With the heightened concerns on excess activity in derivatives trading, the increase in the securities transaction tax on future and options is not a surprise. Coupled with the increase in the capital gains tax rates with immediate effect, we can expect some moderation in the overall capital market activity levels.

Agriculture growth was tepid at 1.4 percent in FY24 compared with 4.7 percent in the previous year, despite the economy expanding 8.2 percent in FY24. Consumption growth has also been muted at 4 percent. The government has been hoping for a better monsoon this year to provide a boost to rural economy.

Nominal GDP is expected to decline to Rs 326.4 lakh crore in FY25, compared with Rs 327.7 lakh crore target set in the Interim Budget. Nominal growth had averaged 9.6 percent to Rs 295.4 lakh crore from 269.5 lakh crore in the previous year 2023-24, according to provisional estimates released by the National Statistical Office on May 31. This slowed down from 14.2 percent in the preceding year. The real GDP expanded at 8.2 percent in FY24 compared with 7 percent in the previous year. The decline, economists contend, was due to the wholesale price index slipping into deflation in FY24.  Wholesale inflation remained negative for the better part of the year, with prices in the positive territory only in the last quarter. The WPI inflation had slipped to (-)0.7 percent in FY24, compared with 9.4 percent in the previous year. Upward revisions Indian economic prospects have improved since the Interim Budget in February, with the central bank and international agencies delivering a spate of revisions on the back of the previous year’s growth numbers. The Reserve Bank of India revised the FY25 real GDP growth forecast upwards to 7.2 percent in June from 7 percent pegged earlier. This was followed by a similar revision from Fitch Ratings. The International Monetary Fund now expects the economy to grow at 6.8 percent, 0.3 percentage points higher than previously anticipated 6.5 percent. The Asian Development Bank too has raised India’s growth forecast to 7 percent from 6.7 percent earlier. A higher real growth is also likely to lift the nominal growth.

"Why a populist Budget won’t be bad, after all",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/budget/why-a-populist-budget-wont-be-bad-after-all-12774703.html,Economy,"July 22, 2024 05:16 PM","By Divam Sharma, Founder and Fund Manager at Green Portfolio Populist budgets don’t necessarily need to be bad, nor do they need to please everyone. The budget back in February was nothing close to being populist, but now we might see some populist measures as the government tries to gain public confidence and support. Let’s look at things from a couple of different perspectives. First off, consumption. A populist budget can really help improve consumption spending, particularly in rural areas. We have seen FMCG staying muted during most of FY24. So, a populist budget can be beneficial as it would help in the revival of demand from the rural side in FMCG which has been laggard due to erratic rainfalls impacting the farming industry hence lower consumption from that side. We have already started seeing some green shots here and there in rural consumption, and a good budget would further aid in that growth. Also read: Economic Survey pegs FY25 GDP growth at 6.5-7% It’s all about consumption, we can talk about different sectors but it comes down to consumption for all. The country has been trying to become an electronic hub, and consumption growth can aid in domestic demand for electronics as well. For the auto industry, a subsidy in EVs (electric vehicles) for 2-wheelers and 3-wheelers would push the demand aid in government EV targets and also please consumers. A populist budget can also be really beneficial for the broader economy too. We often talk about the trickle-down effect and GDP multiplier, a populist budget ensures that the money goes down to the masses. These are the ones who spend the money they receive and this in turn ensures a higher GDP multiplier for the economy. These kinds of budgets are focused more on improving the infra and healthcare sectors so that the economy would benefit from the same better roads, bridges, and better healthcare facilities for lower-income populations. We can also expect an increased focus on education, higher education in particular as a measure to focus on the youth of the country which could lead to increased productivity and better quality of talent down the line. Also read: Expenditure on education grew at CAGR 9.4%: Economic Survey 2024 It’s a cycle. Populist budget basically unleashes the animal spirits in consumption. This would help in ensuring good economic momentum in times when there are uncertainties all over the globe. In the case of India, we have seen domestic demand driving the economy when the global economy was under pressure. Higher domestic consumption opportunity drives higher capital in terms of FDI, FII, DII, and retail to markets. Higher amounts of money in hand would lead to more savings and that could aid in the growth of the financial industry and better allocation of funds. Increased consumption and better inflows help expand the overall size of the economy. And again, of course, a populist budget helps the incumbent government to gain back the reduced confidence and ensure continuity with stronger confidence.

Capital Gains Tax: Why fix something that ain’t broke,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/budget/capital-gains-tax-why-fix-something-that-aint-broke-12774815.html,Economy,"July 22, 2024 03:33 PM","By Tushar Pradhan, Director at Hxgon Partners LLP The first full budget of the third term of the BJP government and the first of the coalition government is the subject of much debate already. There are various wishlists that industry bodies, corporates and individuals have prepared and are keenly looking at the fine print at the incoming budget. While it is a full budget, as opposed to an interim budget going into the elections in February, it will also be pertinent to note that in view of only a part of the year now being covered the government may decide to keep the policy oriented and major announcements for next February. Having said that, certain headlines point to some very sensitive issues especially connected to the capital markets, that have grabbed attention lately. While much of the speculation should rightfully border around the overall growth orientation, revenue maximisation and social equity addressed in the budget as main thrusts, the more controversial issue is the one relating to capital gains tax. There is speculation that there may be a change in the rate, or the holding period to determine short or long term for investments in equity and equity related instruments. Such a change if enacted may have an outsized impact on the market as sentiment in the short term is more impactful than the actual outcome. Also read: Economic Survey pegs FY25 GDP growth at 6.5-7% It will be interesting to note the reason why differential tax rates exists between income tax rates and capital gains tax in the first place. In a country that was starved of investment from its own public, the challenge was for providing capital for its growing industrial infrastructure needs by way of incentivising longer term investments by providing a tax arbitrage. If investors are willing to put their savings to work for a longer term, they should be adequately compensated for such allocation that not only satisfies the need for capital formation without additional outlay by the government or its agencies but also provides for a healthy return for deferring the outcome to investors. The capital gains tax globally also follows a similar pattern. For example, in the US, the long-term capital gains tax rates for the 2023 and 2024 tax years are 0%, 15%, or 20% of the profit, depending on the income of the filer. Please note, lower income filers get the benefit of zero capital gains tax there. Click Here To Read All Budget Related News This debate that these tax rates confer some undeserved advantage to investors while the employed majority is paying a higher tax rate is erroneous. The twin advantages of capital formation, employment of private capital for longer term usage is a needed measure for the government to see a lighter load on itself to provide the same. The short-term capital gains tax also is set higher to discourage speculation. Having increased the LTCG from zero to 10 percent and introducing differential rates for debt mutual funds and elongating the term for defining such gains, the government has already done its bit to disincentivise such investments to a certain degree. To change this picture for the worse will be sheer folly. This kind of signaling will sour investor sentiment and the booming equity cult that has recently formed will thus die a premature death. India needs long term investments, and such investments need the support of the government. Investments are not without risk and the just reward for patience is by way of such differential rates and in the larger interest should remain as status quo. After all, don’t fix it if it ain’t broke! Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"Economic Survey shows rise in foreign tourists in India, indicates revival in tourism",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/travel/economic-survey-shows-rise-in-foreign-tourists-in-india-indicates-revival-in-tourism-12774536.html,Economy,"July 22, 2024 02:15 PM","In the post-pandemic period, India's travel and tourism sector has shown strong signs of revival with foreign tourist arrivals (FTAs), one of the laggards in this space, showing signs of growth, the Economic Survey 2023-24 highlighted. The industry recorded over 92 lakh foreign tourist arrivals in 2023, clocking a 43.5 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase. The tourism sector in India is rapidly expanding, with India being ranked 39th in the World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Development Index (TTDI) 2024, the survey said. India earned foreign exchange receipts of over Rs 2.3 lakh crore through tourism, indicating a 65.7 percent YoY increase. India's share of foreign exchange earnings in world tourism receipts increased from 1.38 percent in 2021 to 1.58 percent in 2022. Domestic tourism When it comes to domestic tourism, 29 new sites have been identified for development under the PRASHAD (Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual Heritage Augmentation Drive) scheme which caters to the augmentation of tourism infrastructure at pilgrimage and heritage sites. Out of the total sanctioned amount of Rs 1,621.14 crore for the projects under the scheme, 62.7 percent has been disbursed, the survey added. The government has also revamped its Swadesh Darshan scheme in the form of Swadesh Darshan 2.0 with an outlay of Rs 3,800 crore. The mission aims to create a robust framework for the integrated development of tourism destinations. Under the scheme, 57 destinations across 32 state government and Union Territory administrations have been identified to date. Twenty-nine projects have been sanctioned at a total cost of Rs 644 crore. Job creation The economic survey also mentioned that India's travel and tourism (T&T) sector has been influenced by global inflationary pressures and delays in the recovery of T&T capacity, similar to other economies. However, the decline in price competitiveness since 2021 has been minimal compared to its peers, with only a 0.7 percent drop. India's decline is particularly slight at just 0.1 percent from the 2021 levels, which reflects the government’s consistent efforts to maintain stability despite the slowdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the survey said. The World Economic Forum's TTDI (Travel & Tourism Development Index) 2024 report emphasises the need for improvements in tourist services and infrastructure, and the development of a skilled workforce. In a challenging environment for employment generation in services due to the rise of AI and manufacturing due to rising protectionism, transportation costs and supply concerns, the tourism sector represents a relatively low-hanging fruit for job creation, according to the survey which added that India has to seize this opportunity. To formalise employment within this sector, the Ministry of Tourism has initiated the Incredible India Tourism Facilitator Certificate Programme. This programme aims to create a skilled cadre of tourist facilitators nationwide through a digital platform that offers online learning opportunities and certification courses, the survey added.

India to seek licences to scout Pacific Ocean for critical minerals,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/india-to-seek-licences-to-scout-pacific-ocean-for-critical-minerals-12774681.html,Economy,"July 22, 2024 02:12 PM","India will apply for licences to explore for deep-sea minerals in the Pacific Ocean as it competes to secure supplies of minerals critical for energy transition technologies, a top government scientist told Reuters. The UN-backed International Seabed Authority (ISA) has issued 31 deep-sea exploration licences, including two for India in the Indian Ocean, but is yet to allow mining because the 36-member body is still working on regulations. The 36-member ISA council is meeting in Jamaica this month to negotiate the latest draft of a mining code. M. Ravichandran, the top scientist at India's Ministry of Earth Sciences, said his ministry will work closely with India's mining industry as it readies to apply next year for exploration of seabed minerals in the Pacific. India's critical minerals plans in the Pacific have not been previously reported. China, Russia, and some Pacific Island nations have already secured exploration licences for the Pacific Ocean. India plans to focus on the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a vast plain between Hawaii and Mexico known to hold large volumes of polymetallic nodules containing minerals used in electric vehicles and solar panels including manganese, nickel, copper, and cobalt. First discovered by British sailors in 1873, the potato-shaped nodules take millions of years to form. RESERVOIR OF MINERALS Unlike China, India lacks seabed mining expertise and will take at least three to four years before it is ready to extract minerals from the ocean's depths, experts said. ""We have done a lot of work on the deep sea mining technology but not perfected (it). In that aspect, we are not yet ready,"" said M. Rajeevan, former chief of India's Ministry of Earth Sciences. Opponents of deep-sea mining say that not enough is known about its impact on marine ecosystems. ""I am not confident that current technologies and methods can overcome the environmental concerns,"" said Pradeep Singh, an ocean governance specialist at the Research Institute for Sustainability in Potsdam, Germany. Some 27 countries have called for a moratorium or suspension of all ocean mining-related activities, but some Pacific nations including Nauru and Cook Islands favour deep-sea mining. Nauru is expected to submit a mining license application to the ISA on behalf of Canada's The Metals Company  later this year. India also expects to receive two more exploration permits from the ISA this year for the Indian Ocean, focused on the Carlsberg Ridge and Afanasy-Nikitin Seamount regions, known for polymetallic sulphide deposits and ferromanganese crusts, Ravichandran said. The permits last for 15 years, according to the ISA website.Polymetallic sulphide deposits contain metals such as copper, gold, silver and zinc. Ferromanganese crusts are known for cobalt, nickel, manganese, platinum and rare earth elements among other resources. India, which relies on imports of raw materials such as copper and lithium, has listed 24 minerals as ""critical"" for energy transition. It is also scouting for overseas mineral assets to meet its rising green energy requirements.""This is like racing,"" Ravichandran said of the urgency to seek seabed minerals.

Growth set to slow to 6.5-7% in FY25; Survey asks corporates to pick the baton on job creation,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/budget/growth-set-to-slow-6-5-7-in-fy25-survey-asks-corporates-to-pick-the-baton-on-job-creation-12774569.html,Economy,"July 22, 2024 01:37 PM","Gross domestic product (GDP) will likely grow at 6.5–7 percent in 2024-25, the Economic Survey 2023-2024 projected on July 22, signalling a moderation in the pace of expansion amid potential risks from cheaper imports that could affect private investment. The conservative prospects and the Survey’s flagging of headwinds in the broader economy were predicated on a possible slowing down of private investments. “A note of caution is warranted here. Private capital formation after good growth in the last three years may turn slightly more cautious because of fears of cheaper imports from countries that have excess capacity,” the Survey said. The Survey, the maiden one authored by Chief Economic Adviser V. Anantha Nageswaran, however, flagged some challenges that loomed on the immediate horizon, obliquely advising the government to steadfastly stick to the path of fiscal consolidation and not indulge in extra borrowing to fund non-merit welfare handouts. National income data released on May 31 showed India’s real or inflation-adjusted GDP grew 8.2 percent in 2023-24. The Survey, presented a day ahead of the Budget, made a strong case for investment as a key driver to sustain growth and enable a self-sustaining virtuous cycle.Follow our live blog for the latest on the Economic Survey 2024 To be sure, the government has been emphatically focused on the investment-led growth model. In the Interim Budget for 2024-25, which was presented on February 1, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman pencilled in capital expenditure of Rs 11.1 lakh crore, a growth of 11.1 percent over 2023-24. The focus on capital expenditure relies on the principle that higher public investment in infrastructure projects unleashes economic growth through multipliers. This has grown 33 percent from Rs 7.5 lakh crore in 2022-23 to Rs 10 lakh crore in 2023-24. Highways and ports are long gestation projects, but they can create jobs, with cascading benefits for intermediate industries such as cement and steel. The government’s decision to do the heavy lifting on capital expenditure appears to be a part of the well-crafted medium-term strategy to not just accelerate the pace of infrastructure project execution but also to trigger a cycle of private sector investment, or what economists sometimes describe as the “crowding in” phenomenon. The Survey exhorted the private sector to pick the “baton” from the public sector and sustain the investment momentum in the economy. “Public investment has sustained capital formation in the last several years even as the private sector shed its balance sheet blues and began investing in FY22. Now, it has to receive the baton from the public sector and sustain the investment momentum in the economy,” it said. The evidence suggests that private sector investment has been sub-par. Private sector gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) in machinery and equipment and intellectual property products has grown cumulatively by only 35 percent in the four years to 2022-23. Meanwhile, its GFCF in ‘dwellings, other buildings and structures’ has increased by 105%. This is not a healthy mix. Besides, the slow pace of investment in machinery and equipment and IP products will delay India’s quest to raise the manufacturing share of GDP, delay the improvement in India’s manufacturing competitiveness, and create only a smaller number of higher-quality formal jobs than otherwise, it said. Also read: Indian GCCs employed over 16 lakh people in FY23, shows Economic Survey Letting go-ease of business The Survey obliquely championed the cause, in a mix of philosophy and economic merits, for the government to withdraw from a few areas of business, perhaps as a signal for more privatisation and easier rules, compliances, and procedures for businesses to prosper. “Letting go is part of good governance…The burden is felt more acutely by those least equipped to bear it – small and medium enterprises. It holds them back, leashes their aspirations, and, in the process, holds the country back,” it said. Quoting Isha Upanishad, the CEA, in his signed foreword, was rather upfront for lesser government and authoritarian interference. “Power is a prized possession of governments. They can let go of at least some of it and enjoy the lightness it creates in both the governed and the governing.” Jobs and more Creating jobs by the millions for years on end for the armies of youth who join the queue of hopefuls every year remains a central long-term policy challenge in India. A productive job is the most powerful form of inclusion. According to the Survey the key ingredients for this strategy include a focus on policies that nourish micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to create more jobs and become more productive, reduce the cost of capital, and rationalise the risk-return trade-off for investments. The Survey squarely placed the responsibility of creating jobs with the private sector and asked profitable companies to add capacities and hire more. “It is in the enlightened self-interest of the Indian corporate sector, swimming in excess profits, to take its responsibility to create jobs seriously. Of course, it must find people with the right attitude and skills. That requires another tripartite compact - between the government, the private sector and academia,” it said. This could require appropriate policy intervention from the government to “unshackle the industry and academic institutions to play their respective roles in that mammoth task”. It cited the example of the Apprenticeship Act, which remains a work in progress, at best, in encouraging large-scale apprenticeships in the country. The New Education Policy 2020 proposes freeing India’s higher education from regulatory oversight to market oversight. “A corporate sector that helps shape the design of higher education with inputs to curriculum, evaluation standards, and faculty will pave the way for a high-quality higher education that market competition brings, replacing regulatory oversight,” it said. Also read: India needs to add 7.9 mn jobs annually till 2030, says Economic Survey 2023-24 Farm reforms The Survey made some telling observations about India’s farm sector, which, for too long, has been a tale of market distortions. Successive efforts to dismantle barriers often ran into political resistance, scuttling policy attempts at shifting the terms in favour of farmers by getting rid of unscrupulous middlemen and vested interests that distorted markets. At the core of this is the fear among farmers that they will lose their bargaining power if large corporations and private traders can enter unregulated agriculture produce markets. “A panoply of policies – by national and sub-national governments - working at cross-purposes with each other is hurting farmers’ interests…The payoff will be immense if we untie the knots that bedevil farm sector policies,” the Survey said. It advocated a “return to roots” in terms of farming practices and policymaking, which can generate higher value addition from agriculture, boost farmers’ income, create opportunities for food processing and exports and make the farm sector both “fashionable and productive for India’s urban youth”. Small is beautiful The Survey made a powerful argument for turning India’s micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) into growth engines by ironing out a few rough policy and institutional edges. “These enterprises need maximum relief from the compliance burdens they face. Laws, rules and regulations stretch their finances, abilities and bandwidth, perhaps robbing them of the will to grow,” it said. The estimated 60 million MSMEs form the lifeblood of India’s organised economy, contributing about 45 percent of the country’s GDP and employing about 110 million people.

This progress underscores India's commitment to regulatory reforms, faster approvals, streamlined imports/exports, and reduced compliance burdens, all aimed at fostering transparency and accountability in business operations. Recent tax policies, including corporate tax rationalisation and Goods and Services Tax (GST), have driven significant tax buoyancy, resulting in record-high revenues. Businesses are now calling for stable and simplified tax laws to enhance the ease of doing business and support India’s growth trajectory. Approximately 67 percent of industry leaders, according to a Deloitte Survey, anticipate this to be a key focus in the upcoming budget. A stable and pragmatic tax policy is crucial for sustainable business expansion and increased foreign investments, reducing uncertainty caused by frequent policy changes and disputes. Simplified tax structure: Navigating India’s tax structure has long been a formidable task for businesses, impacting their operational efficiency and overall ease of doing business. There is a pressing need to shift the tax paradigm from focusing on rates to prioritising revenue generation. This transformation can be achieved through moderate tax rates and an expanded tax base, aligning with the vision of 'Developed India' by 2047. Simplifying the tax structure could entail implementing a unified rate for businesses, while individuals can benefit from a straight forward 2 to 3 tier-rate structure featuring low or moderate rates, eliminating surcharges, cesses and maximising deductions. With the rising inflation, the current standard deduction limit of INR 50,000 is insufficient to cover the escalating costs and expenses associated with higher standard of living. There is a strong expectation for a higher linked standard deduction. Additionally, suspending tax compliance requirements during maternity or other significant life events would significantly reduce the compliance burden for individuals, particularly women. There is also a necessity to reform the capital gains tax framework by simplifying rules concerning asset holding periods, varying tax rates, and indexation benefits. India also has an extensive and daunting withholding tax regime - Tax Deduction at Source (TDS) and Tax Collection at Source (TCS) - on domestic transactions. This TDS/ TCS regime raises the compliance cost and resource burden on businesses in India. There are challenges for vendors/ buyers in availing withholding tax credits. The use of technology to substantially increase information collection and use by the government for monitoring and compliance should also be an opportunity for reducing the compliance burden on taxpayers. The existing GST database can be leveraged by the Government to restrict the scope of transactions subject to TDS/ TCS to only those transactions that are not captured under GST. Besides reducing the scope of transactions on which TDS/TCS is imposed, there is also scope to standardize the TDS/TCS rates and thresholds for the transactions that will still remain subject to TDS/ TCS. Reducing unwarranted litigation: Even though India ranked overall at 63 in the World Bank’s Report on Doing Business, it still ranks below 100 on 3 of the 11 indicators used to compute the overall rank of countries. These are enforcing contracts (163), registering property (154), and paying taxes (115). Enforcing contracts and paying taxes are areas where a weak dispute resolution procedure weighs heavily on the business environment in India. Tax disputes in India have risen significantly over the past few years. Many disputes are overturned on appeal, highlighting the need to eliminate unnecessary aggressive assessments. Despite measures like the Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme (VsV), increasing monetary thresholds for filing appeals, high litigation rates continue to plague the business environment. Addressing this requires robust mechanisms to resolve both current and future tax disputes swiftly and efficiently. * Only taxpayer to appeal before tribunal: Restricting appeals before tax tribunals to only taxpayers, as seen in other countries like the US and UK, would enhance efficiency and reduce bureaucratic hurdles. * Using GenAI: Technological advancements, such as generative AI (GenAI) and the deployment of legal bots, present an opportunity to revolutionise tax administration processes. These tools can be extensively trained on legal precedents. Taxpayers' submissions could be digitally analysed by these machines, enabling the tax administration to receive a proposed order based on a thorough analysis of both legal principles and factual data. This approach not only facilitates timely case resolution but also enhances the quality of decisions made. Another potential application could be reimagining the VsV to offer customised settlement terms to taxpayers based on assessments made by GenAI regarding the gravity of the case. Unlike the previous VsV, which primarily relied on whether an appeal was filed by the taxpayer or tax department, this updated approach could offer favorable terms when GenAI identifies a strong taxpayer case, and vice versa. * Strengthening alternate dispute resolution: Reintroducing faceless tax settlements, while leveraging technology tools would promote faster dispute resolutions and also address concerns related to discretionary practices historically associated with tax settlements. Additionally, avenues like mediation and arbitration should be explored which is an established practice in countries such as the UK and US. * Enhancing APA procedures: Refining APAs to ensure tax certainty and reduce compliance costs involves procedural improvements such as e-filing, expedited processes, and streamlined post-APA compliance. Transition to digitisation: The Government has been proactive in developing both physical and digital infrastructure recently, with plans to sustain this momentum. Industry leaders strongly advocate for advancing digitisation through an online single-window system to streamline administrative procedures, reduce paperwork, and expedite necessary approvals. Cybersecurity and regulatory compliance remain critical concerns, highlighting the need to address security risks and ensure regulatory adherence in digital initiatives across industries. Advancing research and development (R&D) initiatives is crucial for driving economic growth, technological advancement, and global competitiveness. Evaluating India's current R&D funding landscape and its outcomes is essential to maximise its impact. The government is anticipated to focus on investment reforms to attract capital for manufacturing and R&D, aiming to boost production scale and competitiveness. Promoting R&D within domestic companies and fostering global R&D services in India to cultivate a skilled talent pool will accelerate innovation, particularly in advancing semiconductor technology. The upcoming Union Budget for fiscal year 2024-25, themed 'Viksit Bharat', aims to outline India’s path to becoming a developed nation by 2047. Ensuring policy consistency and implementing crucial reforms to improve the business environment are critical to achieving this goal. Emphasising a stable and simplified tax regime, along with effective dispute resolution mechanisms, move towards digitisation and advancement of R&D initiatives will enhance India’s global competitiveness in terms of ease of doing business and enable efficient resource allocation for sustained economic growth.

Economy booms but India's young hanker for government jobs,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy-booms-but-indias-young-hanker-for-government-jobs-12773895.html,Economy,"July 21, 2024 11:17 AM","Sunil Kumar, a 30-year-old, has spent the last 9 years of his life chasing a job in the Indian government. Packed with scores of others in makeshift classrooms under tin roofs with barely enough light and air, Kumar has spent years cramming for a variety of tests, including the prestigious civil services exam needed to get a job as a federal government bureaucrat. He has also tried for a provincial civil services post and two other tests for lower level government positions. He has been unsuccessful in 13 attempts to get a job. A resident of Uttar Pradesh, the country's most populous state, Kumar says he will continue to try for a government job until he turns 32, three years short of the cut-off for him to appear in a civil services exam. ""There is more security in government jobs,"" said Kumar. ""If it happens in 2-3 years, the struggle of 10 years will be worth it."" According to government figures, 220 million people applied for federal jobs between 2014-2022, of whom 722,000 were selected. Many of those would have been repeat attempts, but still, tens of millions of young Indians chase government jobs every year even though the economy is booming and the private sector is expanding. The trend underscores cultural and economic anxieties facing many Indians. Despite living in the world's fastest-growing major economy, many are grappling with an uncertain employment market where job opportunities, let alone job security, are hard to come by. Many see government employment as more secure than private-sector jobs in the world's most populous nation. ""If one person in the family gets a government job, the family believes they are settled for life,"" said Zafar Baksh, who runs a training institute for those appearing in tests for such jobs. In neighbouring Bangladesh, student protests against reserved quotas in government jobs killed more than 100 people last week. Since 2014, India's GDP has grown from $2 trillion to near $3.5 trillion in fiscal 2023-24 (April-March) and is expected to expand 7.2% in the current year. The aspirants say the government offers lifelong security, health benefits, pensions and housing, which they may not get in private employment. Few will admit to it, but many of the government jobs also offer the prospect of money under the table. Growing demand for the cram school classes has attracted large players and lessons have moved online too, said Baksh, who sees it as a lucrative and perennial business. ""There will always be demand."" NOT ENOUGH GOOD JOBS Discontent over employment opportunities was cited by analysts as a key reason for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party failing to win a majority on its own in the April-May general election, and returning to power only with the support of allies. Government data released this month showed 20 million new employment opportunities were generated in India each year since 2017/18 but private economists said much of this was self-employment and temporary farm hiring rather than formal positions with regular wages. The government, which presents the first budget since the election next week, is likely to push job creation by giving tax incentives for new manufacturing facilities as well as by encouraging local procurement across sectors like defence, Nomura said in a note this month. But these will take time to yield jobs. ""It's not just that there aren't enough jobs out there, it's also that there are not enough jobs that pay well and give you security of tenure and other benefits,"" said Rosa Abraham, assistant professor at the Centre for Sustainable Employment at Azim Premji University in Bengaluru city. For 22-year old Pradeep Gupta, who hopes to land a government job, working in the private sector is the ""last option"". ""There is honour, job security and less pressure"" in a government job, he said, speaking in the Uttar Pradesh city of Prayagraj, a booming centre of cram schools. Nearly 5 million students applied for 60,000 vacancies in the Uttar Pradesh police force earlier this year and an exam for the post of constable in central government security agencies saw 4.7 million applicants for 26,000 posts. Another giving applicants a shot at positions such as office boys and drivers in government departments, drew close to 2.6 million applicants in 2023 for about 7,500 jobs. Across all levels of government, including armed forces, schools, health services and the military, nearly 6 million jobs remain unfilled, India's main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, has estimated. An email to the federal government seeking data on government employment and vacancies was not answered. GOOD BUSINESS For Maroof Ahmed, who has been running a cram school in Prayagraj since 2014, this has meant good business. Currently, he says, his academy has five branches, tutoring close to 25,000 – 30,000 students a year through physical and online classes. Success rates, or those who procure jobs, are low at about 5-10%, but demand remains high, he said. No data was available on the number of such coaching institutes across the country since much of the industry is informal and unorganised. The clamour for government jobs is as much about attitudes toward work as it is about the state of India's job market, said Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder of staffing firm TeamLease Services. ""The private sector is based on meritocracy and responds to economic ups and downs,"" she said. ""In the government sector, once you get a job, mostly irrespective of your performance, your future is secure.""

Fiscal Deficit: Go easy or pull back? What markets are likely to reward,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/fiscal-deficit-go-easy-or-pull-back-what-markets-are-likely-to-reward-12773476.html,Economy,"July 20, 2024 08:58 AM","By Nilesh Shah, Managing Director at Kotak Mahindra AMC The Union Budget 2024-25 will be presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 23. The fiscal deficit is avidly observed during the Union Budget presentation as it may impact various factors including the country’s rating. Also, the S&P has guided that a 7 percent or below combined (central + state governments) fiscal deficit could lead to a sovereign rating upgrade. The Government of India (GOI) has been able to walk the path of fiscal prudence and trim fiscal deficit from 9.3 percent in FY21 to 5.1 percent for FY25 (as per vote on account). The government fiscal policy has been non-inflationary so far at the same time the push for capex has been much appreciated by the markets. On one hand the government is keeping the fiscal deficit under control, on the other hand the RBI has done a commendable job in lowering inflation and maintaining robust growth. The effect of the same has been observed in both short term and long-term rates. Over the last 2 years, where the US has raised rates by 525 bps, India raised only by 250 bps. Long-term rates are up by 250 bps in the US and 25 bps in India. Globally, the broad themes are dollar weakness and dollar assets de-rating over the next 10 years. Hence, global investors are looking for economies with a superior macro front. Click Here To Read All Budget Expectations The Indian equity market is the best performing in the emerging markets and is among the top 10 largest (by market cap) in the world. Additionally, GOI and the Indian economy are going to reap the benefits of Govt bonds being included in global indices. Since the announcement of the inclusion of Indian government bonds in the JP Morgan GBI-EM, Indian Government Bonds has seen net inflows of Rs 90,000 crore till June 2024. This clearly shows that global investors are looking to increase their allocation to the Indian market. India’s rating upgrade if achieved in the years ahead could bring in substantial incremental flows leading to reduced borrowing cost which can help government spend more money to boost the economy. Hence, the government should continue the good work carried out over the last year and follow the fiscal roadmap plan. Also read: Boosting Agricultural Exports: Budgeting for infrastructure, high-value crops, and ag-tech The government's first major action after its third term was to aid with the construction of an additional three crore rural and urban houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). The scheme appears populist, however, the bulk of the expenditure would be capital in nature. GOI can focus on such additional populist schemes which end up achieving the dual objective of boosting non-inflationary growth and are perceived to be populist. GOI has been slow on disinvestment over the last few years. With the rally in the Indian stock market, the PSU market cap has seen a sharp recovery hence, GOI may consider liquidating its stake where the market float is low. Disinvestment will help the government to manage the revenues prudently without compromising on the fiscal roadmap of 4.5 percent or lower in FY26. Also read: Budget Snapshot | A long view of India’s central government budgets The GOI received Rs 2.11 lakh crore in the form of dividends from the Reserve Bank of India for FY24 which is Rs 1 lakh crore more than what the government had budgeted. This puts the government in a robust situation to manage fiscal deficit by 30 bps on account of the RBI dividend. However, they have some room to increase the tax slab to benefit the middle-class tax payer and keep the major eye on the capex and keep walking the path of fiscal prudence. Also, the government’s strong tax collection and tax buoyancy can provide incremental support to capex supporting the GDP growth in a non-inflationary manner. Given the backdrop, the Indian markets and the investors have reaped significant benefits from the fiscal policy adopted by the GOI over the course of the decade. The continuity on the same front will be rewarded by all asset classes over the medium to long term. Let’s go ahead and seize the moment.

The results come just days before the government is to release its economic survey, predicting future trajectory of growth and Budget. The survey indicated that firms expecting an improvement in conditions went up to 71 percent from 66 percent earlier. The survey interviewed 497 firms across six cities in June to find out their assessment of the present climate, capacity utilisation, financial conditions, and economic assessment over the next six months. “Firms’ perception about the improvement in their own financial position is particularly noteworthy as the share of such firms was 67 percent, the highest since Q3 of 2010-11 (76%),” said Bornali Bhandari, professor, NCAER. The number of firms perceiving an improvement in investment climate went up to 60 percent from nearly half in the previous quarter, with 97.8 percent reporting capacity utilisation at optimal levels. “It also found an uptick in the labour markets’ sentiments as compared with the previous quarter, with more firms planning to increase hiring,” the report noted. The Purchasing Managers’ Index for both manufacturing and services has recorded improvements in activity, with firms reporting multi-year highs in job creation. Notably, the Indian economy is poised to grow faster than earlier expected according to international agencies and the Reserve Bank of India. The IMF recently revised India’s growth forecast upward, expecting the economy to grow 7 percent in FY25, while the RBI expects India to log 7.2 percent growth in the current fiscal. The Indian economy grew 8.2 percent in FY24, recording a fourth straight year of over 7 percent growth.

Speaking at an event organised by Financial Express here, the bureaucrat-turned-central banker said nobody has expected him to be a ""cheerleader"" for the government during his term. ""I am saying from my experience. Nobody expects RBI to be a cheerleader. I have had no such experience,"" he said, responding to a specific question about a lament made by one of his predecessors in a recent book. Asked if he is open for a new term at Mint Road, Das said he is very focused on the current assignment and does not think of anything outside that. Das said the RBI is optimistic that its estimate of 7.2 per cent growth for FY25 will be met, and added that with steady growth, the focus of the policy has to be ""clearly and unambiguously"" on inflation. The inflation elephant is taking pauses and grudgingly moving towards the forest or the 4 per cent target in an unidirectional way, he added. He asked the banks to be watchful on the lag between credit and deposit growth and advised that the former should not exceed the latter. The Governor also warned that the financial system can get exposed to ""structural liquidity issues"" due to the lag between the credit and deposit growth. Amid concerns about Mule accounts being used by fraudsters, Das asked banks to strengthen their customer onboarding and transaction monitoring systems to check unscrupulous activities. The RBI is working with banks and law enforcement agencies to check Mule accounts and digital frauds, he added. Das said RBI's actions on the unsecured lending have had the desired impact and growth in the focus segment has moderated, but flagged concerns on the high ceilings on unsecured lending kept by some banks despite having high exposures already. He advised prudence to such banks and added that they should avoid exuberance. In light of his comments on Friday, which are also preceded by some actions taken by RBI against some errant entities, Das clarified that no one should assume that there is a big problem with the banking system and added that it remains very stable and healthy. The RBI is not looking at any proposal on allowing corporate entities to own or promote banks at present, Das said, adding that the issue of related party transactions is very real and having any control over them is difficult. He said India does not need a proliferation of banks, but well-governed and stable institutions, he said, adding that the on-tap facility for universal bank licenses continues to be open for those qualifying as fit and proper.

Federal Reserve’s critics on inflation should now champion July cut,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/federal-reserves-critics-on-inflation-should-now-champion-july-cut-12772066-12772066.html,Economy,"July 18, 2024 03:24 PM","Back in 2021, legions of critics lambasted the Federal Reserve for failing to take proactive and forward-looking steps against the emerging inflation threat. Curiously, many of them have gone silent on the risk that the Fed might get caught flatfooted again, this time by failing to cut interest rates soon enough in the face of weaker inflation and a cooling labor market. Lawrence Summers, the former US Treasury Secretary and a paid Bloomberg TV contributor, was perhaps the most notable critic of the “behind the curve” Fed a few years back. As recently as a few months ago, he was still warning against rate cuts and floating the idea that the central bank’s next move could be a hike. Summers isn’t an island unto himself, however, as about a third of economists surveyed by Bloomberg saw one or no cuts this year. Consider the cross-section of monetary policy rules, which generate fed funds rate prescriptions based on standard economic variables. Just as they showed that the Fed was behind the curve in 2021 and 2022, four of the five common policy rules — including the classic 1993 Taylor Rule — now suggest policy rates below the current 5.25%-5.5% range. The core personal consumption expenditures deflator — the Fed’s preferred gauge — puts year-over-year inflation at just about 2.6%, less than half of the peak rate of 5.6% in February 2022. While that’s still technically above the Fed’s 2% target, the current policy stance implies a lot of medicine for what’s become a relatively mild ailment. Among the Fed’s top leaders, the goal of forward-looking monetary policy is uncontroversial. The question, however, is how one can put forward-looking policy into practice while also remaining beholden to backward-looking data. Here’s how Chair Jerome Powell tried to explain this dance at an Economic Club of Washington event, in conversation with Bloomberg host and Carlyle Co-Chairman David Rubenstein (emphasis mine):Rubenstein: The Fed has set a target for inflation of 2%. Now, can you clarify? Does that mean that the inflation rate has to be at 2% before you’re ready to move, if you are ready to move? Or does it have to be within sight? And what does it mean to be within sight? Powell: So, when we change interest rates, that tightens financial conditions and that, in turn, affects economic outcomes — you know, growth, labor markets and ultimately inflation, but with lags that can be long and variable, as Milton Friedman famously said. And the implication of that is that if you wait until inflation gets all the way down to 2%, you’ve probably waited too long. Because the tightening that you’re doing — the tightness that you have — is still having effects which will probably drive inflation below 2%. So we’ve been very clear that you wouldn’t wait for inflation to get all the way down to 2%. Our test has been for the past quite some time that we wanted to have greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably down toward our 2% target, and what increases that confidence is more good inflation data. And lately we have been getting some of that. In fairness, Powell has navigated the risks extremely well since mid-2022, and he deserves a lot of credit for putting the American economy in a position to achieve a rare “soft landing.” But he still has to stick it, and there are a number of problems with the “test” that he described. First, there’s room for debate about where underlying inflation actually sits today. The oft-sighted year-over-year figure, of course, is a function of base effects from 12 months earlier. On a three-month annualized basis, core PCE appears to already be below 2%, based on Bloomberg Economics’estimates for the yet-to-be released June data. Many of us have also argued that the entire housing component of inflation feels a lot like yesterday’s news. If you cut it out of the index, year-on-year core PCE inflation is under 2%. I’m not advocating that anyone exclusively use those bespoke slices of the data, but you have to take them into consideration at key inflection points like this one. Second, there’s room for debate about what, exactly, would give the Fed “greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably” toward target. I appreciate the spirit of this Powellism because many of us were head-faked by earlier improvements in the inflation data. But we’ve just had three great reports. And the government data has now hit the mark in about 8 of the past 12 months, lending less weight to the first-quarter numbers that weren’t so pristine. In a data series that’s inherently imperfect and noisy, that strikes me as enough. Personally, that’s why I’ve been in the July rate-cut camp since the immaculate consumer price index report on July 11. As I said at the time, I still have serious doubts that the Fed will listen, primarily because they’ve convinced themselves that they can, indeed, be simultaneously “forward looking” and “data dependent.” They also seem to believe that they have to spend weeks priming the markets for their first move through subtle smoke signals in the Fed’s policy statement and, probably, through a series of speeches — giving modern markets too little credit. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has climbed in each of the past three months. To be sure, the unemployment drift owes itself largely to labour market entrants, re-entrants and relatively weak hiring, and layoffs remain very low. But history has shown that labour market trouble can snowball in a hurry. So why take the chance? A cut at the following meeting in September probably wouldn’t be the end of the world, but waiting introduces the risk that the window of opportunity could close. In a July 15 note titled “Why Wait?,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc Chief Economist Jan Hatzius also observed that inflation data — while encouraging now — is inherently volatile. If policymakers wait, he said they may find that the data won’t cooperate, and the rate reduction could be “awkward” to explain. Then what, November? Hatzius also noted that the September meeting would come right before the presidential election, and policymakers may want to avoid the perception of putting their thumb on the scale. Ultimately, they shouldn’t get caught waiting for a perfect opportunity when it might never arrive. Hatzius summed it up best: “If the case for a cut is clear, why wait another seven weeks before delivering it?” Credit: Bloomberg  ",NEGATIVE

It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. First things first.In the last two days, I saw a lot of anger on social media after a controversial Bill by the Karnataka state government ruffled feathers when it proposed mandatory reservation of up to 70 percent for locals in private jobs. Why would the state do such a thing to risk Bengaluru’s image as an emerging global tech-startup hub and deter fresh investments? Unsurprisingly, industry leaders and senior ministers  were up in arms against the proposal from the word go. And, as expected, a day later the state government put the proposal on hold. Frankly, implementation of such a Bill would have been disastrous. One, the status of Bengaluru as a global tech and startup hub would have taken a hit if companies were forced to scan domicile certificates, rather than merit records.Secondly, this would have had a cascading impact on the local economy.(God save those Bengaluru retirees relying on rental income for a living when ‘outsiders’ start vacating flats!).  That’s not all. If other states too followed Karnataka’s formula, we would be looking at nothing less than total chaos in the job market. Overall, Karnataka quota-for-locals is a hare-brained idea. But I totally get why the state wanted to bring local reservations in the first place—a major job crisis is in the making. Lack of opportunities for newcomers and influx into the job market post mega layoffs are adding to the woes. Just yesterday, I read a report  about a stampede-like situation when more than 25,000 applicants turned up for 2,600 vacancies walked in for an interview at Air India Airport Services Ltd recruitment drive for airport loaders. This isn’t an isolated incident.According to the India Employment Report 2024 published by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the Institute of Human Development (IHD), nearly 83% of the jobless population under the age of 34 . In this context, it’s quite logical that local governments want to entice local vote banks, offering job reservations. But come on! You can’t throw the baby out with the bathwater. Moving on, the Union Budget 2024-2025 is scheduled next Tuesday. The general consensus is that the government will stick to the path of fiscal consolidation and use the Rs 2 trillion RBI dividend to cushion its expenditure plans, keeping the fiscal slippage under check. Investors are hoping for a direct consumption push and tax cuts. But, if any hike in capital gains tax happens, it could also act as a big markets dampener. On the other hand, if the government chooses to give the big Budget push to affordable housing, as my colleague Aparna Iyer writes in this piece, it will augur well for a rural economic revival and help create more jobs. The probability of a big infra push in this Budget is a fair expectation as my colleagues Jitendra Kumar Gupta and Bharat Gianani wrote in this piece . A bunch of construction-related stocks may draw investor attention. In India, the onus to fund long-term infra projects remain a burden of PSBs—a key reasons why the government won’t privatise these banks. Ideally, they should; as I wrote a few days ago. Tailpiece  Before signing off, tomorrow (July 19) marks the 55th anniversary of bank nationalisation. It was on this day back in 1969, Indira Gandhi nationalised 14 banks.

India targets $110 billion FDI a year to help boost economy,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/india-targets-110-billion-fdi-a-year-to-help-boost-economy-12771920.html,Economy,"July 18, 2024 01:50 PM","India is aiming to boost annual foreign direct investment by more than 50% to help lift economic growth, according to a top official at the government’s investment promotion agency. “For the next seven years, our goal is to draw $110 billion per year which amounts roughly $1 trillion plus over the next 10 years,” Nivruti Rai, managing director of Invest India, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV’s Paul Allen on Thursday. “We have to work hard toward growing at a rate higher than 10%.” India’s annual average FDI in the seven years through March 2023 amounted to $71 billion, according to figures from the investment agency, which is a joint venture between the Ministry of Commerce and private business chambers. Official data from the government show a decline in FDI into India since 2022, even though the country is positioning itself as an alternative manufacturing hub to China, with companies like Apple Inc. setting up factories in the country in recent years. Invest India has highlighted eight priority areas for investment: electronics manufacturing, automobiles, infrastructure, green energy, food processing, textiles, pharmaceuticals and foreign institutional investment. Rai believes these sectors will help India achieve economic growth of more than 10%. Commenting on recent news that Tesla Inc.’s investment in India has cooled, Rai said she was “not concerned” and that the trend is still for higher investment.

"Fiscal deficit at 5% of GDP for FY25, nominal growth at 11%: MC Economists Poll",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/fiscal-deficit-at-5-of-gdp-for-fy25-nominal-growth-at-11-mc-economists-poll-12771730.html,Economy,"July 18, 2024 01:36 PM","The government is likely to record a lower fiscal deficit and a higher growth than what was estimated in the Interim Budget, as it retains its focus on fiscal prudence, economists said in a poll conducted by Moneycontrol. The median forecast of 16 economists pegged the fiscal deficit at 5 percent of the GDP, 10 basis points lower than the 5.1 percent target set in the Interim Budget. None of the economists polled by Moneycontrol expects a slippage on the fiscal front.  On the other hand, the economists noted that the output is likely to get a boost with the government projecting an 11 percent nominal growth, compared with 10.5 percent projected in the Interim Budget. IDFC First Bank and ANZ pegged the growth at 11.5 percent, higher than other forecasts in the poll.  India saw a spate of forecast revisions on the growth front, following a better-than-expected 8.2 percent growth in FY25 and hopes of recovery in private investment and consumption. The IMF on July 16 revised its FY25 growth forecast for real GDP to 7 percent from 6.8 percent projected in April. Capital spending is expected to remain unchanged from the interim budget at Rs 11.11 lakh crore. The forecasts ranged from Rs 11 lakh crore to Rs 12 lakh crore. Push for rural The economists were unanimous in predicting that the budget will provide a push for the rural economy, muted consumption and jobless growth were the most cited concerns for the economy. Among the schemes that could push growth, the economists cited the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana as a primary driver. Sujan Hajra, chief economist, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, cited production-linked incentive schemes and PMAY as schemes that could have a major impact. Rajani Sinha, chief economist at CareEdge, was upbeat on Skill India and PLI as major impact initiators, while Aditi Nayar, chief economist at Icra, said that the scheme for special assistance to states for capital expenditure could have a major impact. Over two-thirds of the economists did cite increased rural allocations, PMAY as one of the three social interventions expected in the budget, with 64 percent batting for rural development or increased rural allocation and 50 percent citing PMAY.  Moreover, 90 percent noted that there was a case for expansion for rural employment scheme, the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, Krishi Kalyan and Ayushman Bharat programme. A higher nominal growth and more-than-expected dividend from the Reserve Bank of India to the tune of Rs 1.3 lakh crore is expected to provide space for the government to expand coverage of schemes. Shift in focus The focus is also likely to shift away from 2047, as only 60 percent of the economists were sure that the government will lay a roadmap for 2047 in the upcoming budget. “Provisions for adequate capital to support National Infrastructure Pipeline and PM Gatishakti programmes should be the primary priority area for Vision 2047,” said Debopam Chaudhuri of Piramal Enterprises Ltd.

India plans to ease rice export curbs as stocks surge to record,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/india-plans-to-ease-rice-export-curbs-as-stocks-surge-to-record-12771895.html,Economy,"July 18, 2024 01:28 PM","India is likely to cut the floor price for basmati rice exports and replace the 20% export tax on parboiled rice with a fixed duty on overseas shipments, government sources said, as rice inventories in the country jumped a record high. The world's biggest rice exporter imposed various curbs on exports in 2023 and continued them in 2024 in an effort to keep local prices in check ahead of the general elections held in April-May. New Delhi is expected to lower the basmati rice's minimum export price (MEP) to $800-$850 a metric ton, down from $950 a ton, to boost shipments, said the sources, who didn't wish to be identified as they are not authorised to talk to media. Lowering the MEP would help India retain its market share against Pakistan, which exported a record amount of rice this year due to New Delhi's export curbs. India and Pakistan are the leading exporters of basmati rice. New Delhi exports more than 4 million metric tons of basmati - the premium long-grain variety famed for its aroma - to countries such as Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the United States. New Delhi is also expected to drop the 20% export tax on parboiled rice and introduce a minimum export tax to stop under-invoicing of shipments, the sources said. The government was examining possibilities of easing rice export curb, including resuming white rice exports, Reuters reported last month. Â  Â  Worried over expectations of lower output due to the El Nino weather pattern, India banned overseas shipments of non-basmati white rice varieties in July 2023 and imposed curbs on other grades. ""With rice supplies significantly exceeding local demand, it's crucial to reduce stockpiles to prevent spoilage. The most effective solution is to lift export restrictions,"" said B.V. Krishna Rao, president of the Rice Exporters Association (REA). The country's rice stocks at state warehouses have jumped to 48.51 million metric tons as of July 1, the highest ever for the month and nearly 19% more than last year, according to the Food Corporation of India. New Delhi would also review the export ban on non-basmati white rice after assessing the progress of rice planting, the sources said. Farmers have so far planted 11.6 million hectares with rice paddy during the current planting, up 20.7% on the same period last year.

India’s digital payments system needs simpler KYC process to reach newer heights,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/indias-digital-payments-system-needs-simpler-kyc-process-to-reach-newer-heights-12771464.html,Economy,"July 18, 2024 08:15 AM","India's digitalization journey has become a notable success, with the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) standing out globally as a model case study. The rise of digital payments in India, from $300 billion in 2018 to $3.6 trillion in 2024, with projections to double by 2030, demonstrates a significant transformation. Robust demographic expansion, improved economic conditions, widespread internet access, and strong government support for digital infrastructure have fuelled this growth in digital payments across the country. Along with UPI, other digital payment instruments such as cards and digital wallets have also gained traction, accounting for around 10% of current digital transaction values. This progress aligns with the Reserve Bank of India's goal to widely expand digital payments. India has established itself as a global leader in the digital payment sector, accounting for a significant percentage of worldwide transaction volumes. UPI's acceptance in several countries, with plans to expand further, underscores its international success. The decline in cash-based transactions to less than 60% highlights the widespread adoption of digital payments across India. UPI’s interoperability, ease of use, and real-time settlement have made it a preferred choice for a wide range of transactions, from peer-to-peer transfers to merchant payments. UPI transactions have experienced remarkable growth, surpassing 10 billion monthly transactions. Additionally, with countries like Singapore, the UAE, Mauritius, Oman, and Indonesia accepting UPI payments there has been a significant increase in cross-border transactions using the UPI method of payment. Transcending Demographic Categories Digital payments are now preferred across demographics, significantly changing consumer behaviours for both online and offline transactions. As of 2024, UPI also boasts over 260 million users, and this number is expected to grow even further as smart devices are becoming increasingly popular. According to a jointly produced report by AT Kearney and Amazon Pay, 90% of consumers opt for digital methods for online purchases, while 50% prefer digital payments for offline transactions as well. Digital payments are especially popular for discretionary spending such as electronics, clothing, and footwear, indicating a notable shift in purchasing behaviour. Millennials are at the forefront of adopting all types of digital payment instruments. The primary reasons for this widespread adoption are the convenience, speed, and efficiency of digital transactions. Additionally, boomers have significantly embraced digital payments, with higher usage of cards and wallets. Adoption rates among genders are roughly equal, with both men and women using digital payments in 72% of their transactions. Digital payment integration has been extensive in urban areas, with smaller towns reporting a 65% adoption rate and larger cities around 75%. Emerging technologies like co-branded credit cards and Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) schemes are rapidly gaining popularity, showing significant consumer awareness and adoption. Merchants across various sectors, from street vendors to large retail establishments, have also adopted digital payments, which constitute approximately 69% of their transaction volumes. This adoption is driven by need to mitigate challenges like financial fraud and handling cash. KYC Processes Have Scope for Improvement The future growth of India's digital payments ecosystem will depend on increasing penetration in underserved segments and boosting transaction values through digital means. A collaborative effort among all stakeholders, including payment providers, governmental agencies, and service players, is essential for sustained growth. An area for improvement that will further drive adoption involves simplifying Know Your Customer (KYC) processes, which are currently seen as cumbersome due to extensive documentation and verification requirements. Though Aadhaar-based KYC exists, streamlining it further through advanced technologies for identity verification, such as biometrics and artificial intelligence, would securely expedite identity confirmation with minimal hassle for users. Additionally, adjusting KYC requirements to match the risk levels of different transaction types could enhance the user experience without compromising security. Simplifying KYC would improve the customer and merchant experiences and broaden access, encouraging more users to adopt digital payments. Supportive Regulatory Environment As India progresses towards a digital-first economy, building trust and ensuring convenience will be crucial. By addressing the needs of both consumers and merchants and fostering a supportive regulatory environment, India is poised to maintain its leadership in the digital payment sector, ensuring continuous growth and enhancing economic inclusivity. The government's focus on creating a conducive regulatory environment has fostered innovation and growth in the digital payments sector. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has played a pivotal role in developing guidelines and frameworks to ensure the security and reliability of digital transactions. Measures such as two-factor authentication, tokenization, and the Payments Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF) have strengthened the ecosystem. Digital payments' impact extends beyond the financial sector, with significant implications for economic growth and social development. Increased use of digital transactions has led to greater financial transparency and improve targeting of government subsidies and welfare schemes. Additionally, digital payments have opened new avenues for financial inclusion, particularly for underserved segments such as rural populations and small businesses, where credit and insurance products can be designed based on history of UPI transactions. Privacy Concerns Need to be Addressed As India's digital payments ecosystem evolves and we move into a cashless economy, challenges remain. The collection and handling of vast amounts of personal data by payment providers raise concerns about data privacy. As concerns about data privacy increase, the risk of cyberattacks, fraud, and hacking also increases. Digital payment providers need to ensure that cybersecurity measures are mandated to protect user data and maintain consumer trust in the digital payment ecosystem. The government and industry stakeholders must work together to enhance system resilience, educate users, and promote responsible innovation. While bigger cities in the country have relatively better digital infrastructure, rural and remote areas often face issues with internet connectivity and access to digital payment services. The government should ensure that it takes measures to enhance digital infrastructure across the country to make sure there is uniform growth. Despite these challenges, the future of digital payments in India is promising. Through collaborative efforts among the government, industry stakeholders, and users, India can continue to advance its digital payments ecosystem and achieve greater financial inclusion and economic growth. As India continues to lead the global digital payments revolution, it sets an example for other nations aspiring to create inclusive, efficient, and secure financial systems.

The country's combined food and fertiliser bill is expected to reach 3.88 trillion rupees, up 5% rise from the estimate in the interim budget unveiled before the election. Interim budget estimates will be replaced by a new budget from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government that will be presented on July 23. Food and fertiliser subsidies in the interim budget accounted for about 8% of India's total spending of 47.66 trillion rupees during the fiscal year that ends on March 31, 2025. In the interim budget, the food subsidy bill was estimated at 2.05 trillion rupees, two of the sources said. The increase since then is largely due to a rise in the price at which the government buys rice and wheat from domestic farmers, one of the sources said. Meanwhile, the government is likely to stick to its previous estimate of 1.64 trillion rupees for the fertiliser subsidy, two of the sources said. The ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

Police to politics: Mumbai's ex-police commissioners who wore khadi after khaki,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/police-to-politics-mumbais-ex-police-commissioners-who-wore-khadi-after-khaki-12780088.html,Politics,"July 27, 2024 06:48 PM","Recently, former Police Commissioner of Mumbai, Sanjay Pandey, announced that he will be contesting the upcoming Legislative Assembly elections from the Versova seat in Mumbai. He has plunged into politics by forming his own outfit, named Rashtriya Janhit Party. Seen as close to Uddhav Thackeray, the 1986 batch IPS officer had earlier contemplated contesting the Lok Sabha polls but dropped the idea. However, this time he has decided to become a full-time politician. Pandey is not the first ex-Police Commissioner of Mumbai who is trying his luck in politics. Two more former police chiefs of the megapolis chose politics as their post-retirement career. The Mumbai police chief's post is a coveted and most sought-after position in the Maharashtra Police. Most of the IPS officers of the Maharashtra cadre aspire to become Police Commissioner of Mumbai when they reach the helm of their career. The post is considered more important than that of the state police chief. The person appointed as Mumbai Police Commissioner is usually a blue-eyed boy of the incumbent politicians. The post brings with itself glamour, tremendous power, and perks, both official and unofficial. To remain powerful even after retirement, some politicians take the political route. In 2024, then Commissioner of Mumbai Police took voluntary retirement despite having two years of service remaining. He was offered candidacy by the BJP from Uttar Pradesh's Bagpat, his hometown, for the Lok Sabha elections. However, his exit from the force was quite dramatic. Then Congress CM of Maharashtra, Prithviraj Chavan, delayed the acceptance of his resignation, apparently on request of Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) chief Ajit Singh. Singh was the sitting MP from Bagpat and was contesting again. He was wary of Satyapal Singh, who was potentially a tough competitor. Satyapal Singh's candidature from BJP was on limbo. However, a twist in the story came when he gave an interview to a TV news channel donning a Khaki uniform and praised Narendra Modi on camera. He said that Modi was the most suited person to lead the nation. A serving IPS officer praising an opposition leader didn't go down well with the incumbent Congress-NCP top brass. His resignation was accepted shortly after the interview was aired. Satyapal Singh was reprimanded by CM Chavan for the interview, but it turned out to be a blessing in disguise for him. He went on to defeat Ajit Singh in the elections and became part of Modi's council of ministers. In 2019, the BJP repeated his candidacy from Bagpat, and he won a second term. However, due to an alliance with the RLD in 2024 polls, the BJP left the seat for RLD, and Satyapal Singh couldn't contest. Arup Patnaik is another former Police Commissioner of Mumbai who entered the electoral fray. The 1979 batch officer was the 36th Police Commissioner of Mumbai. He retired in 2015 and joined the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) in his home state of Odisha in 2018. The BJD gave him candidature from the Bhubaneswar seat in 2019, which he lost to the BJP candidate. In 2024, the party fielded him from Puri, but again he was defeated by BJP's Sambit Patra. Although Patnaik hasn't been able to win any elections, he held key positions during erstwhile CM Naveen Patnaik's tenure and was accorded cabinet minister status.

Could YSRCP's potential alignment with the INDIA bloc be a game changer?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/could-ysrcps-potential-alignment-with-the-india-bloc-be-a-game-changer-12778360.html,Politics,"July 25, 2024 04:13 PM","The political situation in India is currently filled with speculation and strategic manoeuvres, with the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) at the centre. Led by the dynamic and often controversial figure of YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, YSRCP is aligning itself with the opposition INDIA bloc. This potential alliance could significantly impact the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), already dealing with a delicate position in the Rajya Sabha. The series of events started with a seemingly harmless yet politically charged request. For the first time, the YSRCP brought up the issue of giving the position of Lok Sabha Deputy Speaker to the INDIA bloc. V Vijay Sai Reddy, the General Secretary of YSRCP and the leader of Rajya Sabha, expressed this demand during an all-party meeting called by the NDA government. He stressed that the position of Deputy Speaker, traditionally held by an opposition member, has been open for too long and should rightfully be given to a candidate from the opposition. This demand was more than a request; it indicated a clear shift in YSRCP's alliances. During a recent protest in New Delhi, the plot thickened as Jagan Mohan Reddy accused the ruling Telugu Desam Party (TDP) of orchestrating violence against YSRCP workers. He staged a dharna that saw an unexpected and significant turnout of leaders from the INDIA bloc. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav was among them, and his presence and vocal condemnation of the violence marked a notable show of solidarity. Yadav's support and criticism of the NDA's actions in Andhra Pradesh sent a strong message of potential alliance. Representatives from other members of the INDIA bloc, including the Indian Union Muslim League, Trinamool Congress, Shiv Sena (UBT), Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), AIADMK, and VCK, further supported the protest. Their involvement highlighted a growing sense of unity and a strategic effort to welcome the YSRCP into their alliance. Akhilesh Yadav's direct invitation to Jagan Mohan Reddy from the protest stage to join the INDIA bloc was filled with political significance. What impact will this potential alliance have on the BJP? The numbers tell the story. The YSRCP has 11 members in the Rajya Sabha and four MPs in the Lok Sabha. While their addition may not significantly alter the balance in the Lok Sabha, it could substantially strengthen the opposition in the Rajya Sabha. With 19 vacant seats, the Rajya Sabha's total strength is 226, with the majority mark at 113. The BJP-led NDA currently holds 101 seats, falling short of the majority, while the opposition INDIA bloc is slightly behind with 87 seats. If YSRCP joins the INDIA bloc, the opposition's numbers would rise to 98, bringing them closer to the majority and making it significantly more challenging for the BJP to pass legislation in the Rajya Sabha. If YSRCP joins the INDIA bloc, the opposition's numbers would rise to 98, tantalizingly close to the majority mark. This shift could make it significantly more challenging for the BJP to pass legislation in the Rajya Sabha. The recent alignment of the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) with the opposition, after maintaining a neutral stance for years, further highlights the potential impact of such strategic alliances. Amid these developments, the TDP has not stayed silent. TDP MPs held a press conference, accusing Jagan of using diversionary tactics. TDP MP B Nagaraju claimed that Jagan's government had targeted TDP members during its tenure and urged him to address issues within the Andhra Pradesh assembly instead of protesting in Delhi. This response highlights the intense political rivalry and the strategic manoeuvres both parties employ. During Jagan’s protest, the streets of New Delhi were vibrant with activity. Slogans filled the air as leaders of the INDIA bloc stood in solidarity with YSRCP. This unity displayed a common cause and revealed a developing political strategy to challenge the BJP-led NDA government. The potential alliance with the YSRCP is a strategic move for the INDIA bloc. By bringing YSRCP into its fold, the opposition could enhance its position in the Rajya Sabha, making it more difficult for the BJP to pass legislation. For Jagan Mohan Reddy, aligning with the INDIA bloc could help his party avoid political isolation and strengthen its position against the resurging TDP in Andhra Pradesh. The possible alignment of YSRCP with the INDIA bloc carries significant implications. It highlights the ever-changing nature of political alliances in India and the strategic importance of each parliamentary seat. As Jagan Mohan Reddy considers his options, the BJP should prepare for a potential reshaping of the political landscape in the Rajya Sabha. The next few days will show whether this potential alliance comes to fruition and how it will impact the complex dance of Indian politics.

"Congress has been systematically targeting RSS with bans, a brief look at history",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/congress-has-been-systematically-targeting-rss-with-bans-a-brief-look-at-history-12777797.html,Politics,"July 25, 2024 11:34 AM","(RSSFACTS is a column that demystifies the functioning, organisational structure and ideology of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh). The Central government has lifted the ban on the government employees joining the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). This ban was imposed by the Indira Gandhi-led Congress government in 1966. Several Opposition parties led by Congress have objected to the Central government orders. This despite the fact that there have been several judgements since then which allowed the government employees not to be penalised for being part of the RSS as the Courts considered it to be a lawful socio-cultural organisation. To give an example, the Madhya Pradesh High Court had delivered a decision regarding this and when the then Congress government objected to it, the Supreme Court rejected the objection of the state government (Petition for Special Leave to Appeal Civil No.  4679/1980). According to an article written by noted lawyer Alok Kumar and republished in digital edition of the weekly Organiser on July 22, 2024, the Supreme Court while rejecting the petition had observed, “Neither the RSS nor the Jan Sangh is alleged to be engaged in any subversive or other illegal activity; nor are the organisations banned.  Most people, including intellectuals, may not agree with the programme and philosophy of the Jan Sangh and the RSS or, for that matter, many other political parties and organisations of an altogether different hue. But that is irrelevant. Everyone is entitled to his thoughts and views. There are no barriers. Our Constitution guarantees that. In fact, members of these organisations continue to be members of Parliament and. and State Legislatures. They are heard often with respect inside and outside the Parliament. What was wrong in his being a member of an organisation which is not even alleged to be devoted to subversive or illegal activities?” First ban on the RSS post-independence The Congress government order to stop the government employees from joining the RSS in 1966 wasn’t a standalone order. The Congress, worried, over the growing influence of the RSS especially in the post-independence era had been looking to crush the organisation. The first attempt to that effect was made in 1948 after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. The RSS was falsely implicated and was banned. Mahatma was assassinated on January 30, 1948. Without even holding an enquiry the RSS Sarsanghchalak MS Golwalkar was arrested on February 2, 1948. The RSS was banned through a central government notification on February 4. Congress stalwart Dwarika Prasad Mishra, who was the Home Minister of Central Provinces at that time, writes in his autobiography, Living in An Era (Pp59), “That Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination gave a handle to unscrupulous politicians to defame and, if possible, to pull down their rivals is difficult to deny.” Nehru government failed in its attempt to crush the RSS by falsely implicating it and it had to finally lift the ban on the RSS on the midnight of July 11, 1949. Golwalkar was released on July 13, 1949 from Baitul prison. He went straight to Nagpur from there where the RSS had its headquarters. 1966 ban order and JL Kapur Commission The 1966 order to ban government employees from joining the RSS was part of a larger plan as in 1966, the Congress government headed by then prime minister Indira Gandhi had also set up a new judicial commission to thoroughly probe the assassination of Gandhi. The commission was headed by Justice JL Kapur, a retired judge of the Supreme Court. The commission published its report in 1969 and before that it had examined 101 witnesses and 407 documents. Its key findings were: ‘They (the accused) have not been proved to have been members of the RSS, nor has that organization been shown to have had a hand in the murder.’ (vol. I, p. 186). ‘There is no evidence that the RSS as such was indulging in violent activities against Mahatma Gandhi or the top Congress leaders.’ (vol. I. p. 66). An Indian civil services officer RN Banerjee, who was the union home secretary at the time of Gandhi’s assassination also deposed before the Kapur Commission. Banerjee categorically said in his deposition that even if the RSS had been banned earlier, it would not have affected the conspirators or the course of events “because they have not been proved to have been members of the RSS nor has that organisation been shown to have a hand in the murder”. Two more bans When the Congress couldn’t fix the RSS in 1948, 1966 and 1969, it again hit back in 1975 and banned the RSS during emergency. However, the RSS not only survived that ban but turned the tables on the Congress and led from the front a movement that led to defeat of both the Emergency and the Congress. Another attempt was made by the Congress government at the Centre to ban the RSS in 1992 in wake of the Babri Masjid demolition. But the RSS bounced back again and soon its ideological mentee Bharatiya Janata Party formed the first National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at the Centre. Earlier RSSFACTS columns can be read here.

'Pleasing allies': Southern discomfort over neglect in Modi 3.0 Budget proposals,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/pleasing-allies-southern-discomfort-over-neglect-in-modi-3-0-budget-proposals-12777470.html,Politics,"July 24, 2024 08:19 PM","The Union Budget is fuelling political opposition in several of the southern states as the perception that economic largesse is being distributed to other states for political reasons is growing. Except for Andhra Pradesh - its ruling party, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), being an ally in the Union NDA government - all other southern state heads have termed the Union budget as catering to vote-bank politics. The BJP might have only wanted to please its allies, the TDP in Andhra Pradesh and the JD(U) in Bihar, but the fact that other states in the South are being ruled by parties opposed to the BJP is giving the whole controversy a worrying north-south dimension. Indeed, Telangana Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy is talking of bringing together other chief ministers in the South to take on the Centre over the Union Budget allocations, delimitation of Parliamentary Constituencies, central funds, Centre-state relationship, what states are getting back from GST etc. In protest, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin was the first to announce the boycott of the upcoming NITI Aayog Governing Council meeting convened by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on July 27. ""I will boycott it. It will only be appropriate to boycott a Union government’s meeting as Tamil Nadu was boycotted (in the Union Budget),"" Stalin said addressing the media on Tuesday. He also remarked, to a question, that as there was no mention of Tamil Nadu or Tamil in the Union budget and he presumed that 'they' are angry with the people of the state, post Lok Sabha election results. Stalin's argument that there were only announcements to satisfy regional allies, though without any guarantee they will be implemented, finds resonance in Karnataka, where Chief Minister Siddaramaiah similarly announced the boycott of the July 27 meeting. He said that Modi was unable to see beyond Andhra Pradesh and Bihar as his eyes were only fixed on the position of Prime Minister and he hoped the people of Karnataka would stand by the state government. ""Despite my earnest efforts in calling for an all-party MPs meeting in New Delhi to discuss Karnataka's essential needs, the Union Budget has neglected our state's demands,"" fumed Siddaramaiah, in a statement on X. The Union Budget has renewed the tussle between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh just when they were coming together to solve outstanding issues. While the Union Budget has earmarked a special financial package of ₹15,000 crore for the development of the new capital city of Amaravati, neighbouring Telangana got nothing. A livid Revanth Reddy termed the Union Budget as 'kursi bachao budget' and the allocations to Andhra Pradesh and Bihar as 'nazrana'. Criticising the allocations Reddy said, ""The word Telengana was banned in the entire Budget. The Centre does not like to utter Telangana. People of Telangana never expected the Centre to pursue a vindictive approach against the state."" He remarked that Telengana was not part of Viksit Bharat as far as Modi was concerned. Earlier this month, Reddy and Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu met to work out and resolve the outstanding issues between the two states that have been bickering since the formation of Telangana in 2014. Naidu is the political mentor of Reddy and they share a good rapport. There was much hope in resolving the issues between the two states. But, the allocation to Andhra Pradesh has dampened the hope. Naidu has also come in for criticism from his opposition for his inability to get special category status for Andhra Pradesh, despite the Union government depending on the TDP's alliance. Budget mentioned that ₹15,000 would be ""arranged"", but it does not mean allocated, they say. There are fears that this might not be anything more than facilitating loans from multilateral lending agencies. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan joined the state opposition, taking strong objection to his state not getting a mention in the Union Budget, which according to him was a ""survival ploy"". ""Many states, including Kerala, are being ignored in the Budget. Though we do not oppose the announcements of development projects in specific states, we cannot accept the complete neglect of other states. This approach will hinder the progress of states like Kerala. It challenges the people of Kerala that the continuous demands regarding some important projects were completely disregarded,"" Pinarayi said in a statement. Far from satisfying the South, the Budget might have worsened the ties of the opposition-ruled states with the Centre. It might also have bonded the INDIA bloc stronger.

The disagreement arose when Banerjee asserted that the House had not discussed the three controversial farm laws, brought in by the Narendra Modi government in 2020, that were subsequently repealed. Speaker Birla strongly contested this claim, insisting that the laws had been debated in Parliament. ""In 2020, the same Modi government unilaterally passed three contentious farm bills without any consultation with the farmers, farmer organisations or any Opposition parties,"" the TMC leader said. Reacting strongly to Banerjee's claims, Birla said, ""This House discussed the issue for five-and-a-half hours."" As Banerjee continued to stress his claim, the Speaker further stated, ""When the Speaker speaks, he speaks right. You correct yourself."" Furthermore, targetting the Modi government over the Union Budget presented on July 23, Banerjee said that it is ""anti-people"" and aimed at ""appeasing and compensating"" coalition partners of the ruling NDA. ""The budget has no vision and agenda. There is no relief to the common people and the budget has neglected 140 crore people of the country,"" he said in a hard-hitting speech amid repeated disruption by a few BJP members from West Bengal. The TMC MP said he will expand the word 'BUDGET' as B for betrayal, U for unemployment, D for deprived, G for guarantees which were failed by the government, E for eccentric decisions and T for tragedies. He said the NDA government has allegedly betrayed the citizens, farmers, housewives, daily wage earners and many others during its rule. Targetting BJP over the verdict of Lok Sabha polls, he said the results are a rejection of ""arrogance and divisive politics"" of the BJP.

BJP allies and government ministers have been demonstrating their support for Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Maurya, signaling a show of strength amidst the ongoing power struggle between the government and the party organization. Cabinet Minister Sanjay Nishad met with Maurya on July 23, marking his second meeting in 10 days. Maurya shared two photos of their meeting on social media platform X, captioning them as a courtesy visit to Nishad Party President Dr. Sanjay Nishad, where various issues were discussed. This meeting is seen as part of a broader mobilization effort within political circles.लखनऊ के सात कालिदास मार्ग स्थित कैंप कार्यालय पर मा0 कैबिनेट मंत्री एवं निषाद पार्टी के राष्ट्रीय अध्यक्ष डॉ. संजय निषाद जी एवं निषाद पार्टी के प्रदेश अध्यक्ष श्री रविंद्र मणि निषाद जी से शिष्टाचार भेंटकर विभिन्न विषयों पर वार्ता की।@mahamana4u @nishadparty4u pic.twitter.com/NvFGAlvKPE — Keshav Prasad Maurya (@kpmaurya1) July 23, 2024 On Monday, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath held a review meeting with officials in Azamgarh, inviting Panchayati Raj minister and Sudeldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP) chief Om Prakash Rajbhar. However, Rajbhar did not attend the meeting and instead met with Deputy CM Keshav Maurya in Lucknow that evening. A senior BJP leader, speaking anonymously, highlighted a prevailing perception of a Thakur-dominated government in UP, suggesting this image needs to be corrected to avoid challenges in upcoming elections. The ongoing tussle is being viewed as part of preparations to position Maurya as the prominent OBC face in the state. BJP allies in UP have been vocal against the Yogi government, with national presidents writing letters and making public statements. Political experts suggest that following the Lok Sabha election defeat, tensions have surfaced within both the central and state governments. Sources indicate that the BJP leadership is quietly supporting Maurya to counter the opposition's PDA (backward, Dalit, and minority) strategy. Allies criticize Yogi government On June 27, Apna Dal chief Anupriya Patel accused the Yogi government of discriminating in the OBC reservation. She claimed that Dalits were being unfairly denied jobs, causing widespread anger, and called for an end to this practice. Sanjay Nishad, president of the Nishad Party, questioned the effectiveness of CM Yogi's bulldozer policy, expressing concerns about the impact of demolishing people's homes on their voting behavior. He also criticized the government on OBC reservation issues. RLD chief Jayant Chaudhary opposed the government's directive to display shopkeepers' names on the Kanwar Yatra route, arguing that pilgrims do not select services based on caste or religion and urging the government to retract the decision. SBSP chief OP Rajbhar supported Maurya's assertion that the organization is more important than the government, emphasizing the foundational role of workers in both the party and governance. Keshav Maurya's position and grievances: Keshav Maurya, who was the BJP's state president during the 2017 UP assembly elections, saw the party achieve significant success but missed out on the Chief Minister position, which went to Yogi Adityanath. Maurya had to settle for the Deputy CM role. Since then, reports of discord between Maurya and Yogi have surfaced frequently. In the 2022 assembly elections, Maurya lost his Sirathu seat, further weakening his standing. However, following the Lok Sabha elections, Yogi's influence within the party is perceived to be waning, reigniting discussions of differences between the two leaders. On July 14, Maurya stirred political waters by stating at a state executive committee meeting that the organization is greater than the government, reaffirming his commitment to party workers above his official position. This echoed a similar statement he made two years ago, shortly after losing his assembly seat, indicating his longstanding dissatisfaction with the current leadership dynamics. The political landscape in Uttar Pradesh is marked by a growing divide between the Yogi Adityanath government and its allies, who are increasingly rallying behind Keshav Maurya. As the tussle continues, the implications for the upcoming elections and the internal balance of power within the BJP remain to be seen.

'Jarange factor' haunts Mahayuti again in Maharashtra: Will Sharad Pawar intervene?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/jarange-factor-haunts-mahayuti-again-in-maharashtra-will-sharad-pawar-intervene-12777167.html,Politics,"July 24, 2024 03:22 PM","One of the several factors that led to Mahayuti's debacle in the last Lok Sabha polls was the agitation led by Manoj Jarange Patil for reservations to Marathas in government jobs and education. Despite Eknath Shinde adopting several measures to placate the agitators, the Jarange factor is once again challenging the Mahayuti alliance in the run-up to Maharashtra assembly polls. Manoj Jarange Patil has once again resorted to a ""fast unto death,"" withdrawing it four days later with an ultimatum of August 13. It was his fourth such fast in a span of a year. This time, his demand is to extend the reservation benefits to the blood relatives of those people within the OBC quota who have been found eligible to avail the reservation benefits. Although the Shinde government announced a ten percent independent reservation to the Marathas by calling a special legislative session, Jarange Patil is not satisfied. There is a fear that the Supreme Court could strike down the reservation as it breaches the 50 percent limit of reservations set by the apex court in its earlier verdict. The court has already expressed its displeasure when it overturned the reservation granted to Marathas by the Devendra Fadnavis government in 2018. The Shinde government is now trapped in a Catch-22 situation. With the OBC groups protesting against Jarange's demand, fearing that a deluge of additional applicants will cut down the opportunities for the existing groups. Like Manoj Jarange, a person named Laxman Hake has emerged as a leader of the OBCs. Apart from him, leaders like Chhagan Bhujbal are also aggressively vocal against Jarange's demands. With the Vidhan Sabha polls just three months away, the Shinde government doesn't want to antagonize any of the communities. Both Marathas and the OBCs have a substantial presence in the state electorally. The opposition MVA has capitalized on the issue during the Lok Sabha polls and is planning to repeat the same in the upcoming polls. The Mahayuti is wary of Sharad Pawar, whom they see playing a role in Jarange's agitation. Recently, Chhagan Bhujbal met Pawar and pleaded for his intervention in putting an end to the issue. Bhujbal argued that the reservation issue is leading to acrimony among the communities in rural areas, and things could worsen. Initially reluctant, Sharad Pawar then met CM Eknath Shinde to discuss the issue. All eyes are now on Sharad Pawar to see whether he comes up with a solution to the stalemate while keeping his political interests intact.

The court on Tuesday dismissed the pleas seeking cancellation and re-test of the exam, holding that there was no evidence on record to conclude that it was ""vitiated"" on account of ""systemic breach"" of its sanctity. The court said the leak occurred in a couple of cities. BJP leader and former union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad hit out at the opposition, especially Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, following the verdict, accusing him of defaming India's examination globally with his strong words. His choice of words were violative of Parliament's dignity and the dignity of the office of the Leader of Opposition, a position Gandhi holds, Prasad said.

India needs to face up to its junk food crisis,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/india-needs-to-face-up-to-its-junk-food-crisis-12774831.html,Politics,"July 22, 2024 03:19 PM","India is not the world’s healthiest country. Sadly, regulators seem determined to make the problem worse with each passing year. Urban Indians, especially wealthier ones, have a relatively sedentary lifestyle, and our diet is heavy in carbohydrates and fats. This may not show up easily in the numbers, given the size of the country’s population.Analysis in the Lancet recently found that about 23% of Indians were technically overweight, defined as a body mass index over 25. Many parts of the world, such as West Asia and Eastern Europe, do much worse. But, when you break the data down, worrying trends emerge. Women over 30, for instance, have startlingly high rates of abdominal obesity in India — with a prevalence of over 55% for women older than 40. That is a more dangerous indicator of predisposition to metabolic disease than regular BMI. Moreover, genetics seem to make Indians particularly vulnerable to such ailments. One scientist at the generic pharma major Lupin Ltd has pointed out that Indians tend to have greater insulin resistance and develop Type II diabetes at a younger age than the average. The Lancet suggests that over 100 million Indians have diabetes, and 136 million are pre-diabetic. That’s a crisis — one that’s set to grow worse as India becomes richer and more urban. The problem is usually blamed on a change in the diets of middle-class Indians, from fresh to processed foods. The assumption is that packaged products are unhealthier. It’s right there in the name: “junk food.” I’m a tiny bit skeptical. I am addicted to Delhi’s deep-fried street food, and I am not so sure it is better for me than anything I could buy in a supermarket. At the same time, there is data suggesting junk food in India is worse than in many other countries, with higher levels of salt, sugar, and saturated fats. More importantly, packaged food can be regulated, so people at least know what they’re eating. Ideally, that would allow consumers to better manage their intake of fat and salt. There remains a lot of room for this transition in India. Nestle India Ltd. claims that branded food makes up only a third of the Indian market but will expand at a compound annual growth rate above 12% in coming years. The question is whether regulators are up to the task. They recently announced that nutritional information about sugar, salt and saturated fat would henceforth be displayed “in bold letters and relatively increased font size on labels of packaged food items.” The news was generally welcomed. In fact, it represented a significant climbdown. The new rules specify that this information will be estimated based on (arbitrary) serving sizes, and as a percentage of recommended daily intake. Translating this into “good” or “bad” requires a level of mental math that the average shopper likely won’t want to endure. The regulations replace a draft plan that would have imposed fewer requirements on shoppers but was still flawed. In 2022, officials proposed a “star” rating, similar to the ones used to indicate if an appliance is energy-efficient. As scientists pointed out, that merely “helps the consumer choose the least unhealthy option among a host of unhealthy options.” Critics worry that India’s food regulators respond more readily to big food companies than to doctors. The last time they backtracked on warning labels, they placated angry consumers by telling them a new adviser would study the issue — a man whom the New York Times described as leading an institution “almost entirely funded by the Goliaths of the agribusiness, food, and pharmaceutical industries.” The processed food industry is shooting itself in the foot. If companies want Indians to make the switch from mouth-watering street food, they ought to welcome greater transparency, so consumers can be certain they are choosing healthier alternatives. Better models are available even in India’s neighborhood. In Sri Lanka, for example, sodas are labeled with a “traffic light” system that goes from green (healthy) to red (godawful levels of sugar). Recent research has shown that the system consistently steers consumers towards healthier choices. Indians need simple, easy-to-understand, and prominent warning labels, so that their better natures are given a chance to overtake their impulses. Otherwise, their richer country will only be an unhealthier one. Credit: Bloomberg  ",NEGATIVE
US: Democrats clear the runway for Kamala Harris,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/us-democrats-clear-the-runway-for-kamala-harris-12774830.html,Politics,"July 22, 2024 03:11 PM","Barring an unexpected turn of events in a season of unexpected turns of events, Vice President Kamala Harris will be the next Democratic nominee for president. “I think it’s almost inevitable that Kamala Harris will end up being the nominee,” Robert Shrum, Director of the Center for the Political Future at the University of Southern California and a veteran of a half century of Democratic campaigns, told me. President Joe Biden’s departure from the race on Sunday was one man’s extraordinary decision. But it was a sum of the efforts of thousands. The Democratic Party was not uniformly in favor of jettisoning Biden. But its center of gravity had shifted against him. There are two points that are especially notable about that fact, and both are highly relevant to the weeks ahead. First, the Democratic Party has a center of gravity and that center found itself. Second, that gravitational mass just completed an unprecedented work of collective action, involving both party elites and rank and file, with the work taking place both publicly and privately. It was an uncanny feat in a party representing tens of millions of individuals. Democrats accomplished the political equivalent of soaring off the high dive into a bucket of water. Now, some are demanding that the party recreate the act, only this time with a few added somersaults and twists. A wide-open convention in Chicago? A televised traveling circus with Bill Clinton andBarack Obama interviewing aspirants for the nation’s highest office? Oprah something something? No. The Democratic National Committee’s convention rules committee met virtually on Friday and reaffirmed that the party’s virtual roll call vote, nominating the party’s candidates for president and vice president, would take place between Aug. 1 and Aug. 7. There are hard deadlines that the party must meet for the nominees to be on state ballots. Harris should be looking to sew up support quickly, and be the consensus choice by the first week of August. The party convention should be used to remind the nation who Donald Trump is. Likely Republican lawsuits to prevent Biden from withdrawing from the ballot, or the party from choosing a replacement, present an opportunity to remind voters that Jan. 6 is a state of mind in MAGA land, and that free elections are at risk if Republicans succeed. Biden’s departure will surely whet the appetites of ambitious Democrats who would like to be president. But no credible challenger countered Biden’s reelection campaign in part because no one wanted to risk the blame for, or reality of, a second Trump presidency and its attendant assault on democratic institutions and practices. That political deterrent, which governed party behavior from 2022 to the present, should continue to check some ambitions between now and the first week of August. Fortunately for the party, the obvious contenders are mostly young and can afford to wait for another chance. The three words that risk party fratricide – “now or never” – don’t apply to 52-year-old Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer or 42-year-old Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg or even 56-year-old California Governor Gavin Newsom. Both Whitmer and Newsom, the most viable challengers, have said they will not run against Harris, 59. Their restraint will make an already difficult challenge slightly more daunting for any second-tier candidates contemplating a run. A veteran Democratic consultant with no particular affinity for Harris told me that it was difficult to conceive of a rationale for a campaign against her. Consensus began building for Harris within minutes. As Georgetown University political scientist Jonathan Ladd wrote on social media, the party appears to be making its decision “in fast forward.” That leaves Harris in the dominant position. Biden endorsed her, which will help influence his most fervent supporters. Her task in the days ahead is to ward off potential challengers, consolidate support and contemplate running mates. The vice-presidential nomination should prove extremely attractive: a less than four-month campaign for the White House with virtually no chance of being blamed for a defeat. With democracy on the line, the incentive toward another round of partywide collective action is strong. Harris is not fully trusted as a top-tier candidate. She occasionally fumbles. She might lose a few White votes that Biden might have claimed. But she brings genuine strengths. She may excite some of the young voters – especially young women – who turned away from Biden. She may inspire new energy among Black voters. She gives women a different stake in the race than they had the day before Biden dropped out.

The minister (Dharmendra Pradhan) has blamed everyone but himself. I doubt he even grasps the fundamental issues at play"". He also noted, ""The issue at hand is that millions of students in the country are deeply concerned and believe that the Indian examination system is compromised. There is a widespread perception that wealth can influence and manipulate the system. This sentiment is also shared by many in the Opposition"". Further questioning the Centre's handling of alleged paper leaks in competitive exams, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav slammed the government, claiming it is setting new records for paper leaks. ""Students nationwide are protesting, investigations are revealing more, and arrests are being made. My only request is that students will not receive justice as long as this minister remains in office,"" Yadav stated. Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, responding to the allegations, stated that exam results have been released according to the Supreme Court's directions. ""I prefer not to engage in politics, but I have records of how many paper leaks occurred during Akhilesh Yadav's tenure as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh,"" he said. Pradhan said he is serving at the ""mercy of my leader"" and stated that the government is ""collectively answerable"" for the situation. The Education minister defended his position, asserting that he has the support of his constituency and does not require validation from Parliament. He condemned Gandhi's characterisation of the examination system as ""rubbish,"" calling it an unfortunate statement. He also said, ""Over the past seven years, the National Testing Agency (NTA) has conducted more than 240 exams, with over 5 crore students applying and over 4 crore participating. While there have been incidents, the current case is under the Supreme Court's scrutiny, with the Chief Justice personally overseeing the proceedings"". Besides, Pradhan also took a dig at the previous government, referencing a ""remote control"" jab often used by the BJP against the Manmohan Singh administration. ""In 2010, three education reform bills were introduced by then-Minister Kapil Sibal, one of which aimed to prohibit unfair practices. The question remains: Why was that bill withdrawn? Was it due to pressure from private medical colleges? Now, those who questioned us are raising issues"", he noted. Opposition parties in the Lok Sabha raised concerns about exam paper leaks, demanding Pradhan’s resignation and the scrapping of the NEET, prompting Speaker Om Birla to call for a constructive discussion. Birla stated that widespread criticism could harm the perception of India's education system globally. He noted that the CBI and Supreme Court are already investigating the leaks and urged for the development of a better system rather than questioning all examinations. Following Birla's remarks, Rahul Gandhi attempted to speak but was not permitted. In protest, the LoP, along with other Opposition members from TMC and DMK, walked out of the House. Congress Deputy Leader Gaurav Gogoi led slogans demanding the resignation of Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan. Following the Opposition's walkout, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi said, ""Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan should have addressed the issue directly. Instead, he spoke about the Supreme Court and PM Modi but did not clarify his actions on the matter. NEET is a crucial issue for the youth. Despite our repeated requests for parliamentary discussion, the government shows no interest. We will continue to raise this issue and pressure the government"", during an interaction with the media.

India must play peacemaker in bloodied Bangladesh ,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/india-must-play-peacemaker-in-bloodied-bangladesh-12774075.html,Politics,"July 22, 2024 08:24 AM","Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government can’t wash its hands of the bloodbath in Bangladesh – more than a 140 agitating young men have been already killed in the anti-quota protests rocking our neighbour – because India has a far bigger stake in Bangladesh than any other country in the whole world. Any upheaval there -- whether it leads to regime change or eventually dissipates – has grave implications for our national security. It’s therefore in our own strategic interests to sort out the mess on a war footing and restore normalcy there at any cost. It’s perfectly okay to take an official stand that the deadly turmoil in Bangladesh is its internal matter, advice Indian nationals there to steer clear of trouble and evacuate them if necessary, as our External Affairs Ministry has done in the circumstances. But India mustn’t stop at that because it is the resident power with onerous duties and responsibilities that it can shirk only at its own cost. As things stand today, New Delhi can’t afford to dither or look away. It has no option but to take charge as an elder brother, if not ‘big brother’, in its zone of influence. Hasina’s cancelled foreign trips indicate a big problem The volatility can be gauged from the fact that Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who had to cut short her state visit to China last week and return home to quell the violent protests by university students against job quotas which gathered momentum in her absence, has now been compelled to cancel her tour of Spain and Brazil to handle the increasingly dangerous state of affairs. An indefinite national curfew and shoot-on-sight order is in force, the army, paramilitary, tanks and armoured carriers are patrolling the streets, mobile internet and broadband service is shut down and all trains have been cancelled by Hasina’s Awami League administration, turning the densely populated Muslim nation at our doorstep into a ticking time bomb. Fake news for sympathy Notably, even as Bangladesh burned, mid-week there were reports of opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party leaders being closeted in the Chinese embassy in Dhaka with Beijing’s diplomats, who were joined by the Pakistani High Commissioner making it a threesome! These patently untrue stories were obviously planted in the media by Hasina’s government to gain India’s sympathies by characterising the skyrocketing turmoil as the handiwork of colluding anti-India BNP, Pakistani and Chinese saboteurs. Fortunately, New Delhi - which thoroughly monitors its backyard - has seen through all these canards. It is treating with equal disdain fabricated reports of anti-quota protestors demanding termination of India’s access to railways, roads and rivers in their country as one of the pre-conditions to call of their agitation. On Sunday, the Supreme Court scaled back the job quotas but hasn’t altogether abolished the highly discriminatory government job reservations which blatantly favour the Awami League and triggered the students’ rebellion. The judicial intervention is unlikely to restore normalcy immediately given the high number of casualties and brutalities inflicted by the army-police at Hasina’s behest which has created a chasm between the regime and ordinary Bangladeshis. India needs to counsel restraint In such a foreboding scenario, India’s task is cut out. Without wasting any time, New Delhi must counsel Hasina to control her temper and tongue after all the damage her loose talk, especially the abusive-derogatory term “Razakar”, has done. At the age of 76 and a four-term PM, she should speak like a grandmother-cum-elder statesman and not a rabble rouser hurtling the country into chaos and anarchy. Secondly, New Delhi must become the bridge between the Hasina government and protestors’ leaders so that the two sides sit across the table at the earliest. To put it bluntly, India’s mediation is the need of the hour in Bangladesh. Although India is known to be pro-Hasina, no one in Bangladesh is going to rebuff India if it comes forward as a peacemaker. Ukraine is very far away. Let’s start from our backyard where our standing is at an all-time high. India is the best third-party to end the spiral of violence and usher in peace after all the unnecessary bloodletting of the last few days. Hands-off policy is not realisitic Bangladesh is far too important for India to pursue a hands-off policy at this critical juncture. Let’s not forget that it is not just another neighbouring country like Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan or Sri Lanka – it’s a lot more than that. Geographically, Bangladesh is well and truly embedded “inside” India. Save for a short boundary with Myanmar and the waters of the Bay of Bengal in the south, Bangladesh is surrounded by as many as five Indian states – West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram – on all sides. In that sense, Bangladesh is indeed “inside” India – and therefore far more important than a neighbour in the traditional sense. Bangladesh’s domestic politics and governance naturally impact India more than any other country in the world. A Bangladesh on the boil would be disastrous for India’s restive northeast. So the faster we act, the better for us and our dear neighbour.

Jammu in jihadist crosshairs,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/jammu-in-jihadist-crosshairs-12774018.html,Politics,"July 22, 2024 08:23 AM","Unlike financial analysts who start ringing alarm bells the moment they see corporate earnings either weaken or not in line with expectations in any quarter, security analysts (at least at the policy making level) seem to wait until the problem can no longer be explained away. Until then they prefer to quote statistics to convince everyone that everything is under control. From around 2021 there have been a series of terrorist strikes in this region, not just against civilians but also against security forces. And yet, these attacks were not considered as indicative of the shift in the area of operation from Kashmir valley to Jammu. It is only after the recent spate of ambushes of security force convoys by terrorists in the Jammu region that the security establishment has woken up to the growing presence and actions of jihadist terrorists south of Pir Panjal in J&K. Terrain hopping to avoid pressure The increase in terrorist actions in Jammu is not surprising. There was enormous security pressure in the Kashmir Valley. The shelf life of terrorists had reduced drastically, except for the odd killing of an unarmed civilian or off-duty security force official by the part-time, ‘hybrid’ terrorists active in Kashmir. It was therefore natural for terrorists, particularly the foreign (read Pakistani) terrorists to shift operations to Jammu where the terrain and geography provided them some cover, as well as easier ingress and egress routes. The fact that for close to two decades the Jammu region had been cleansed of terrorists also helped. There was just not the same laser focus on terrorism in the Jammu division that was there in Kashmir division. From around 2020, security forces had been thinned in the region and redeployed on other more active fronts. This has created some gaps in the security grid that could be exploited by the terrorists. Jammu gets reinforcements The security establishment is now once again beefing up troops in the region to hunt down the terrorists. But this could prove to be a bit of a long haul, especially if over the last three years or so the terrorists have re-established their networks of support and sustenance. As things stand, the intelligence grid of the security forces appears to be rusted. This will need to be made more robust for operations to become more effective. The engagement of security forces with locals is critical. But this too will take some doing because it will mean navigating through political grievances - people of the region feel they have been ignored and neglected - and social/communal tensions that have erupted in the last few years. Intelligence vacuum but… For now, there is no solid information or intelligence on the strength of terrorists active in the region. What is known is that these are not the garden variety hybrid terrorist that is common in Kashmir. If the terror attacks in Jammu are anything to go by, these are highly trained, disciplined, battle hardened terrorists, well versed in laying ambushes, adept in hit-and-run attacks, trained to use the terrain to their advantage to hide and strike. Signs point to Pakistan Army All these manifest attributes suggest that these are probably serving or recent retirees of Pakistan army (perhaps Special Services Group commandos), or predominantly Punjabi and some Pashtun Taliban aligned to Pakistan Army with experience of having waged jihad in Afghanistan. It still is not clear if they are surviving off the land or receiving support in the form of supplies and information - ideological, religious, political, or simply coerced - from locals. Given the areas in which attacks have taken place - from Poonch and Rajauri to Reasi, Kathua and Doda - it is unlikely if it is the same group. There are some estimates that 40-50 terrorists might be active, operating in groups of four-to-five. But that there could be more is not something that can be ruled out. From whatever is available in the public domain, it is also not clear if these terrorists are receiving instructions from their handlers sitting in Pakistan- occupied Kashmir or they are autonomous in their operations. What is clear is that the weapons they are using - US-made M4 assault rifles which are now awash in the arms bazaar in Pakistan - have given them an edge, more so because some of these are equipped with night vision devices. M4, AK-47 and Afghanistan spillover In a sense, the M4 in the 2020s is what the AK-47 was in the 1990s, when the security forces were still equipped with the unwieldy SLRs and police still carried .303 Lee Enfield rifles of WW-I vintage. It took a long time for Indian security forces to equip themselves with gear - rifles, helmets, bullet-proof vests - that was suited to anti-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations. The same is the case with the communications equipment. Back in the 1990s, while the terrorists used frequency hopping Kenwood sets, the security forces had vintage communication systems. Something similar is happening today. When the Americans abandoned Afghanistan, it was known that some of the weapons they had left behind would find their way into India. But as is the wont of the security establishment, no one really prepared for the inevitable. For some strange reason - is it a false sense of chivalry? - there appears to be a reluctance to deploy frontline weapon systems - drones, helicopters, etc. - to hunt down terrorists. It is almost as though these are being saved for some other day. Even as the security forces brace to carry out another Operation Sarp Vinash in Jammu, it is important that the security strategy be reviewed. Use Village Defence Councils but at least provide them with better weapons than outdated .303 rifles. Use the latest technologies available to gain an advantage over the terrorists and take them out with minimal loss of personnel. There is no chivalry in sacrificing our own forces because we want to convince the world that we fight like gentlemen against barbarians. Ensure that the insertion of new troops in Jammu is not by pulling out troops from Kashmir and reducing the pressure on terrorists in the Valley. Most of all, politicians and generals need to stop declaring premature victories and/or underestimating, downplaying the terrorist threat.

'If helpless people come ...': Mamata Banerjee's offer for shelter as Bangladesh crisis spirals,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/politics/if-helpless-people-come-mamata-banerjees-offer-for-shelter-as-bangladesh-crisis-spirals-12774065.html,Politics,"July 21, 2024 10:26 PM","In the wake of escalating violence in Bangladesh, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee announced on Sunday that she would offer shelter to distressed individuals from the neighbouring country. Addressing the Martyrs' Day rally of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in Kolkata, Banerjee asserted her commitment to humanitarian aid, referencing the United Nations Resolution on refugees to justify her stance amid the severe law and order breakdown in Bangladesh over the past few days. Banerjee stated, ""I should not be speaking on the affairs of Bangladesh since that is a sovereign nation and whatever needs to be said on the issue is a subject matter of the Centre. But I can tell you this, if helpless people come knocking on the doors of Bengal, we will surely provide them shelter."" She added that the UN Resolution mandates accommodating refugees in regions adjacent to those experiencing turmoil, citing the example of Assamese people allowed to live in Alipurduar during the Bodo strife. She also assured cooperation to Bengal residents with relatives stuck due to the violence and extended assistance to Bangladeshis in Bengal facing difficulties returning home. Banerjee urged the people of West Bengal to exercise restraint and not be provoked by the situation in Bangladesh, expressing her solidarity with those affected by the violence. Soon after, the President of the BJP’s Bengal unit, Sukanta Majumdar, and junior union minister slammed Banerjee's comments, suggesting that matters involving foreign policy should be consulted with the Centre before making public statements. ""It’s true that we are all concerned about the current situation in Bangladesh over which Delhi is keeping a close watch. Our chief minister should not be voicing her opinions on matters involving our country’s foreign policies without first consulting the Centre,"" Majumdar said. Violence has escalated in Dhaka and other parts of Bangladesh over student protests demanding the reform of the quota system for government jobs. The protests aim to end a system that reserves up to 30 percent of government jobs for relatives of veterans from the 1971 war of independence against Pakistan. Additionally, Banerjee praised Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, who attended the rally, for his party's performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Uttar Pradesh. She criticised the central government, predicting its collapse soon and accusing it of misusing agencies to stay in power. Yadav echoed her sentiments, asserting that the current government in Delhi is not sustainable and will soon fall.

In an indication of the changing political scenario in the state ahead of assembly elections, MLA Atul Benke, a member of the Ajit Pawar camp, met Pawar senior at Shirur MP Amol Kolhe's residence in Pune earlier in the day. Recently, senior NCP leader and minister Chhagan Bhujbal had called on Sharad Pawar at his residence in Pune ostensibly seeking the veteran politician's intervention in dousing the quota fire triggered by OBC-Maratha tussle. Kinhalkar, who comes from Marathwada region, is the second prominent leader of BJP from Nanded to join the NCP (SP) after ex-Union Minister Suryakanta Patil who had also quit the saffron party to join the Sharad Pawar camp. Notably, Kinhalkar had earlier served as an MLA of Bhokar, which was until recently represented by former chief minister Ashok Chavan before he switched over to the BJP. The cross-overs come against the backdrop of the spectacular performance of opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi in recent Lok Sabha polls apparently at the expense of the ruling Mahayuti, especially BJP. Sharad Pawar, who a year ago struggled to keep the flock together after Ajit Pawar engineered a split in NCP, eventually emerged stronger with the NCP (SP) bagging 8 of 10 constituencies in parliamentary polls. Kinhalkar cited the ""changed character"" of the BJP as the reason behind jumping the ship and accused the saffron party of ""rashtradroh"". ""There is a big difference between the BJP I had joined and the BJP I am seeing today. They talk of nationalism, they talk about the people's issues, they also talk of irrigation, but their actions promote rashtradroh (treason), not rashtrahita,"" said Kinhalkar while addressing an NCP (SP) rally in Pimpri-Chinchwad city which was attended by Sharad Pawar, Baramati MP Supriya Sule, and other senior leaders. Kinhalkar had served as the home minister when Pawar was chief minister of Maharashtra. State NCP (SP) president Jayant Patil alleged that 25 leaders from opposition parties facing corruption charges have joined the BJP, and investigation against 23 of them facing graft charges is abated. ""'Better to join the BJP than going to prison' is now the common slogan of the corrupt in Maharashtra,"" Patil said and accused the Mahayuti government of turning Maharashtra ""into the number 1 state for corruption in the country"". Sule alleged she had heard MPs in Parliament talking about their (BJP's) plan to change the Constitution after winning 400 seats in Lok Sabha polls. ""This is my accusation against the BJP. I heard MPs saying the constitution will be changed after bagging 400 seats. This is not a false narrative. You have heard it, the media has heard it,"" claimed Sule as she appealed to voters to restore Maharashtra's self-esteem and pride in the upcoming assembly elections. Bhokar assembly constituency, earlier represented by Kinhalkar, is part of the Nanded Lok Sabha constituency, wrested by the MVA from the BJP with Congress' Vasantrao Chavan defeating sitting MP Prataprao Chikhalikar by 60,000 votes in recent elections. With Suryakanta Patil and Kinhalkar on its side, the NCP (SP) is looking forward to strengthening the party's prospects in the Marathwada region, the epicentre of Maratha quota agitation, especially in Nanded, Hingoli, Parbhani, and Beed districts. The Vijay Sankalp Melava was strategically organised in Pimpri Chinchwad, considered a stronghold of Ajit Pawar when he was part of the undivided NCP. Kinhalkar's entry into the NCP (SP) comes a day ahead of the BJP convention scheduled to be held in Pune which will be addressed by Union Minister Amit Shah and Nitin Gadkari. In a jolt to Ajit, 28 functionaries from Pune district, including the Pimpri-Chinchwad unit's city president and two former corporators, quit the NCP led by him on Wednesday and joined the Sharad Pawar-led faction. Meanwhile, Junnar MLA Benke, who belongs to the Ajit Pawar-led camp, told reporters after meeting Sharad Pawar that ""anything can happen in politics"".

A communication from the LG office to the chief secretary on Friday said that Saxena expressed concern over the ""non-consumption"" of prescribed medical diet and medicines by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal lodged in Tihar jail under judicial custody and asked officers to find out its reasons from him. The communication, citing a report by Tihar Jail's Superintendent (Prison) regarding the health status of Kejriwal, noted that it brings out the fact that there are several instances of ""willful low-calorie intake"" by the chief minister, despite sufficient home-cooked food being provided to him. The report also claimed that Kejriwal refused to take insulin before dinner on July 7. The letter further intensified the political spat on the issue of Kejriwal's health in jail. AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh slammed the LG in a post expressing his disappointment on the claim. ""What kind of joke is this LG Sir? Would a man reduce his sugar levels at night? Which is very dangerous. LG Sir, if you do not know about the disease then you should not write such a letter,"" Singh said. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in a statement alleged that the ""BJP is hatching a sinister plan to kill Kejriwal."" Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva hit back at AAP, saying the report of the Tihar jail superintendent has ""exposed"" Kejriwal's ""conspiracy"" to gain ""sympathy"" by ""deliberately"" taking fewer calories of food and declining insulin to claim weight loss and high blood sugar level in jail. Senior AAP leader and Delhi minister Atishi claimed Kejriwal's sugar level has dipped below 50 mg/dL more than 8 times in jail and added, ""He may go into a coma and there is also a risk of brain stroke in such a situation."" Atishi also attacked the LG saying the communication from his office is ""very unfortunate"" and does not befit a constitutional head of the state. ""Does LG think that any person will deliberately make himself sick like this? This is a conspiracy of the Bharatiya Janata Party. They know that the longer he stays in jail, the more his health will keep deteriorating. ""So I would like to request LG Sahab that it does not suit him to make such comments on anyone's health,"" she said. The Delhi BJP president charged that Kejriwal has been taking less quantity of food from June 6 to July 13 to shed weight so that he could gain sympathy from the court and get bail. ""He campaigned hectically for 21 days, after getting bail from the court, during Lok Sabha polls and he had no health problems then. But, now he is trying to gain sympathy on the pretext of his health condition,"" Sachdeva charged. Kejriwal was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a money laundering case linked to the alleged excise policy scam, on March 21 and has been granted bail by the Supreme Court. , However, he is currently lodged in Tihar in a connected CBI case.

""The Maha Vikas Aghadi is trying to discredit the state government over 'Mazi Ladki Bahni' Yojana. People should be wary of Opposition leaders and workers.

""The conflicts between allies are not new. While differences were kept under wraps during Yogi government 1.0, they have now surfaced publicly in government 2.0. Apna Dal (S) has been vocal in criticising the government's policies, while the state government has responded in an equally confrontational manner,"" said political analyst Manoj Bhadra. He said with the BJP pushed to the wall after its poor show in recent Lok Sabha elections, the allies are now flexing muscles and seeking their pound of flesh. The ongoing friction has led to speculation that Apna Dal (S) might sever its ties with the Yogi government. Questions arise about whether the party will continue its support from the outside if it parts ways with the state government. Given that Apna Dal (S) chief Anupriya Patel is a minister in the Modi government, there is also speculation about whether the BJP's national leadership will intervene. The conflict between Apna Dal (S) and the Yogi government began to intensify after the Lok Sabha elections, with experts pointing to the recruitment of 69,000 assistant teachers as a flashpoint. Apna Dal (S) leadership expressed dissatisfaction with the government's conduct during the elections, citing a lack of support from the government machinery. The issues of conflict: 1.      One of the major issues raised by Apna Dal (S) is the alleged non-compliance with reservation rules in the recruitment of these teachers. The party contends that SC and OBC candidates were not given their due reservations in the recruitment process, a dispute that remains unresolved despite the Yogi government's claims of adherence to reservation policies. 2.      Anupriya Patel escalated the matter by writing a letter to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on June 27, alleging that SC-ST and OBC reservation rules were being ignored in various government department recruitments. She claimed that positions meant for these categories were being filled by general category candidates under the pretext of unavailability of eligible candidates from reserved categories. The government, however, maintains that reservation rules are being strictly followed. 3.      Another significant dispute involved Ashish Patel, executive president of Apna Dal (S) and Technical Education Minister in the Yogi government, who clashed with principal secretary of the department, M. Devraj, over transfer decisions. Patel objected to Devraj's transfer actions, resulting in the transfer session being halted after the file was sent to the Chief Minister's office. Apna Dal (S) officials suspect that Devraj enjoys protection from higher government echelons. 4.      Further tensions were evident when Anupriya Patel publicly raised the issue of reservation once again during a programme in Lucknow commemorating the birth anniversary of Apna Dal (S) founder Sonelal Patel. She emphasized the need for SC-ST and OBC reservations in government department recruitments, a stance she was advised by state BJP leaders to discuss privately with top BJP leadership rather than on public platforms. 5.      Another point of contention was the installation of additional toll booths on the Varanasi-Shaktinagar road. Anupriya Patel objected to the establishment of toll plazas at Fattepur and Ahraura, arguing that they were only 20 kilometers apart, contrary to the NHAI rule that mandates a 40-kilometer distance between tolls. Industrial Development Minister Nandgopal Gupta Nandi dismissed her claims, stating that toll taxes were collected at only one place, and issued a press note to this effect. Political experts believe that Apna Dal (S) is engaging in pressure politics rather than seriously contemplating a split from the BJP. The party aims to signal to its voter base, particularly the backward classes, that it is championing their cause and can pressure the BJP when necessary. Anupriya Patel's statements are seen as attempts to reassure her vote bank and demonstrate that her party can advocate for their interests, even if it means creating friction with the BJP. Political analyst notes that Apna Dal feels the BJP has lost ground among backward and Dalit voters in the Lok Sabha elections. Although Apna Dal (S) itself is not particularly strong among these groups, as evidenced by Anupriya’s narrow electoral victory, her statements are meant to convey a message of solidarity to her vote bank. Similarly, senior journalist Rajesh N Bajpaee believes Apna Dal (S) is not in a position for a direct confrontation but seeks to leverage the BJP's current vulnerabilities. With Kurmi votes shifting away from the BJP in regions like Purvanchal and Awadh, Apna Dal (S) is maintaining pressure to extract concessions. Tripathi also speculates that internal factions within the BJP might be inciting Apna Dal (S) leadership. The unfolding political drama underscores the fragile nature of alliances in the current political landscape, highlighting the ongoing power dynamics and strategic maneuvering among key players in Uttar Pradesh.

Analysts expect modest impact on stock following UltraTech-India Cement deal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/analysts-expect-modest-impact-on-stock-following-ultratech-india-cement-deal-12780359.html,Market,"July 28, 2024 04:59 PM","Market experts expect a modest impact on the stock prices of UltraTech Cement and India Cements following the former's acquisition of a 32.72 percent stake in the southern cement major even though they believe the deal is an important one within the cement space. “The Rs 390 offer price is a modest 4 percent premium over the current market price, so, any significant movement in India Cements' stock on Monday is unlikely, given its recent gains. For UltraTech Cement, the industry's consolidation will likely result in a positive trading outcome on Monday, affirming its market leader status post-acquisition,” said Axis Securities' Uttam Kumar Srimal Independent analyst Ambreesh Baliga said that investing in UltraTech is advisable for long-term gains rather than short-term trading while highlighting the fact that developments like UltraTech Cement acquiring India Cements and Adani’s acquisition of Ambuja Cements and ACC clearly show that industry consolidation is underway. “This trend suggests that the cement industry will soon be dominated by two to three large players, making it difficult for smaller players to compete and likely leading to their acquisition. With ongoing infrastructure and real estate development, cement demand will continue to rise. Since greenfield projects take over 30 months to complete, acquiring smaller players is a strategic move for quick raw material access,” said Baliga The latest acquisition will increase UltraTech Cement’s ownership in India Cements to 55.49 percent, pending regulatory approvals. It will trigger an open offer by UltraTech Cement to buy up to 8.05 crore shares, or 26 percent of the equity, from public shareholders at Rs 390 per share, totalling approximately Rs 3,142.39 crore. While the initial acquisition of a 22.77 percent stake was completed in June, the latest purchase marks the complete stake sale and exit of promoter N Srinivasan from India Cements. ""Now, UltraTech Cement has acquired a controlling stake in India Cements, valuing the deal at $123 per tonne for 14 million tonnes of assets, which is reasonable. UltraTech can optimise these assets with modifications and improvements, facilitating expansion in the same region. This will boost UltraTech's market share in the competitive southern market and contribute to industry consolidation, benefiting companies like UltraTech, Ambuja, ACC, and Dalmia Bharat,” said Kumar of Axis Securities. Interestingly, analysts also believe that while the cement sector is consolidating, Adani's acquisition of ACC and Ambuja has disrupted the market, eroding volumes and blurring regional differences in pricing and positioning. Earlier, the north, south, east, and west had distinct market dynamics, but this has changed post-Adani's acquisition. Shyam Sekhar, portfolio manager and investor, wrote on X, “The South Indian cement industry will never be the same again. Expect the industry to quickly slip into turmoil. The man who held the industry together officially quits the scene. After this, the ensuing free-for-all will see politics, market pressures, ego battles, and greed exert pressures not seen in the industry for the past two decades. Very bad days ahead for Southern cement companies. Their golden era is as good as over. I am calling it today.” Read more: UltraTech Cement board approves acquisition of India Cements The latest acquisition, valued at Rs 3,954 crore for 32.72 percent equity at Rs 390 per share, is contingent on regulatory approvals and will trigger a mandatory open offer at the same price. The earlier acquisition in June was made at Rs 268 per share.

"Stockology: Volatility would be high, and hammering will be stock-specific",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/stockology-volatility-would-be-high-and-hammering-will-be-stock-specific-12780364.html,Market,"July 28, 2024 03:50 PM","Stockology is a weekly column by futurologist Mahesh Gowande. He is the Founder and Director of Ayan Analytics, which has developed ZodiacAnalyst, a research software with time and price charting tools. Read previous columns here Review As expected, below 24290, buying emerged in most of the sectors and stocks. The Budget day panic hit or spike breached 24140 but immediately recovered, and for the next two days there was some element of exposure reduction happened. On Friday, markets once again surprised everyone by closing very near to an all-time high. We had specifically mentioned that the time is not bad; while other parameters are turning slightly negative, the markets won't crash. The midcap space is becoming attractive and as a growing economy, it looks like many midcaps will enter the large-cap category in the quarters to come. The biggest shocker came for the realty sector with the removal of indexation. The sector will witness reduced demand, more people might prefer to pay fewer taxes, and show less value in the transactions. One will have to accept the simplified tax regime going forward. Technical While markets are entering the slightly expensive zone, volatility is set to increase further. The first four days after decline and single candle of the last day of the week have not equalised the losses of the four days. Technical Analysis is simple, and by following basic rules anybody can use it to improve returns and reduce the stress of trading. As per technical, markets have not given a sell signal on short- or long-term charts, therefore, there is no need to anticipate and take actions. After the sell trigger, markets give relief rally to exit from the positions, which is an easy and simple approach. As long as the signal is 'stay invested', do not keep churning the portfolio. The new high close after the spike has made a change in the short-term stop to 24050, and confirmation of exit from trading position is at 23970. The weekly stop is at 22370 and monthly stop is at 21240. On the upside, short-term targets are 24949, and 25241. Both the targets look easy to achieve. Given that the bullish euphoria is mounting day by day, the above target could easily be achieved. TimeMap As mentioned last week, technical gave a small sign of correction – as an opportunity to invest, fundamental factors turned slightly negative. The time influence was positive last week, and is showing positive for the upcoming week as well. There are no major planetary aspects, except on Friday during Venus 90 Uranus, which is negative for the markets. In the current week, banks are coming as negative, and PSU continues to be in a positive phase. Big change is expected on the 30th, as after 10.45, the Sun is entering Nakshatra Ashlesha, which is very positive for the natural resource sector, and particularly for the steel industry. Government-owned mining and metal stocks might attract big-ticket buying from institutions and long-term investors as well. Ashlesha gives the best consolidation and momentum breakout signals, and if on the right side, then BIG money can be made in a short span. Volatility would be high, and hammering will be stock-specific more than broad markets. July 29, 2024: Monday: K.9: Bharni -10.55/Kruttika: Good to Book profits Higher opening and further rise in the first hour cannot be ruled out. As per the earlier observation – Tithi and Nakshatra combination is good for booking profits, and selective short selling as well. The Moon is in Kruttika after 10.55, which means that hourly divergence signals can be aggressively actively participated in to make lot of profitable trades. Realty and banks would be volatile, while textile and retail store stocks will attract investments. Keep an eye on metal and mining stocks, especially the government-owned businesses, as next 10 to 13 days are very positive for the sector. Sell Today Buy Tomorrow (STBT) is indicated. July 30, 2024: Tuesday: K,10: Kruttika -10.23/ Rohini: Volatile after 5 Lower opening of the markets is expected. Mean reversion indicators will give the best results today, and long short baskets will do very well. Bias is negative for the day. Participants would be nervous, and volumes would drop slightly in the pre-lunch session. In the second half, participation would increase. IT sector and communication would see buying, and midcap will witness profit booking and selling. Big probability markets will see a negative closing. July 31, 2024: Wednesday: K.11: Rohini-10.13/Mrugga: Volatile bullish Market sentiment will generally be cautious and slightly nervous under the influence of Tithi 11. Post 10 am, a sudden flow of orders will bring volatility to the markets. Fast action or quick reaction will bring big rewards. One of the best days of the week to participate in a contrarian trade and increase the position once in favour. Aggression and speed is rewarded under the influence of Nakshatra Mrugga. Index movement will be very wide, and option trades can mint money. High Beta stocks and momentum indices will do well. August 1, 2024: Thursday: K.12: Mrugga: Good day Proactive actions get rewarded. Don’t wait for confirmation to go with your study and stick to your strategies. Execute as per trade plans and do not deviate from your own ideas and plans. Prices will misguide andcreate doubts in your mind. Even the most confident people will feel the pressure and tend to back off. We suggest you to be confident and trust your strategy. Systematic traders will make the best profits on August 1. Technology, communications, and logistic sector stocks will hog the limelight. Buy Today Sell Tomorrow (BTST) is indicated. August 2, 2024: Friday: K.13: Aardra: Bad Day Higher opening and rise will be followed by unexpected selling in many counters. We suggest participants to remain alert, especially post-lunch, our observation indicates. Sudden sell off in select counters will disturb the sentiment. Tithi 13 is bad for sector leaders; expect oil and gas sector to get especially hammered. Uranus 90 Venus will be destructive for select companies, especially those that have gone way ahead of their valuations.

This breakout is confirmed by a strong bullish candle. Prices have been finding solid support at the 20-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average), with recent dips being bought into. Additionally, a fresh positive crossover is occurring as the 50-day EMA crosses above the 89-day EMA. Given this setup, we have a positive outlook on the stock.

"FPIs invest Rs 33,600 cr in equities in July amid continued policy reforms, good earnings season",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/fpis-invest-rs-33600-cr-in-equities-in-july-amid-continued-policy-reforms-good-earnings-season-12780297.html,Market,"July 28, 2024 11:25 AM","Foreign investors injected over Rs 33,600 crore into Indian equities so far this month on the expectation of continued policy reforms, sustained economic growth and a better-than-expected earnings season. However, they pulled out over Rs 7,200 crore from equities in the last three trading sessions (July 24-26) after the government hiked taxes on Futures and Options trades (F&O) and capital gains from equity investments in the Budget. Market experts believe that Indian equity is well-positioned for the year to attract foreign investments. However, there may be some monthly volatility due to short-term news. ""Indian equity market and bond market are favourably placed for the year. This should attract foreign flows into the country. There could be some volatility in the flows on a month-on-month basis due to short-term news flows,"" Nimesh Chandan, CIO of Bajaj Finserv AMC, said. According to the data with the depositories, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have made a net inflow of Rs 33,688 crore in equities this month (till July 26). This came following an inflow of Rs 26,565 crore in equities in June, driven by political stability and the sharp rebound in markets. Before that, FPIs withdrew Rs 25,586 crore in May on poll jitters and over Rs 8,700 crore in April on concerns over a tweak in India's tax treaty with Mauritius and a sustained rise in US bond yields. ""Economically, India stands on a strong footing. Moreover, the better-than-expected earnings season so far has improved corporate India's balance sheet that would help in building investor confidence. ""Furthermore, there is growing anticipation of an interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve in September,"" Himanshu Srivastava, Associate Director – Manager Research at Morningstar Investment Research India, said. Upward revisions in India's GDP forecast by the IMF and ADB, and a slowdown in China work in India's favour, he added. A key trend in FPIs and domestic institutional investors' (DII) investment in equity over the last 30 months is that whenever FPIs were consistent sellers, DIIs were consistent buyers. The large inflow of money into domestic mutual funds and the growing influence of retail investors have strengthened domestic investors compared to their foreign counterparts, VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said. Apart from equities, FPIs invested Rs 19,223 crore in the debt market during the period under review. This has pushed the debt tally to Rs 87,847 crore this year so far. With the inclusion in the international bond indices, foreign flows are expected to come into the Indian bond market. This is likely to push G-Sec yields lower, Bajaj Finserv AMC's Chandan said.

"Budget 2024 shines with 9/10: MOFSL's Duggad applauds infrastructure boost, flags missed consumption growth",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gautam-duggad-rates-budget-910-but-cuts-1-mark-due-to-missing-out-opportunity-to-support-consumption-growth-12780154.html,Market,"July 28, 2024 07:58 AM","Gautam Duggad, Head of Research for Institutional Equities at MOFSL, rated the Union Budget a 9 out of 10. He cited the continuation of fiscal policy, a sustained focus on infrastructure, additional support to states for ground-level work (including infrastructure), and a credible fiscal deficit consolidation path as the primary reasons for his high rating. However, he deducted one point due to the budget missing an opportunity to support consumption growth. Following the budget, Duggad, who has over 16 years of experience in fundamental equity research, stated, ""We don’t see any major changes to the portfolio and continue to remain positive on Industrials and Capex, Consumer Discretionary, Real Estate, and PSU Banks."" What Does the Budget Mean for India Inc.? The Union Budget 2024-25 focuses on infrastructure, fiscal consolidation, job creation, MSMEs, women, and agricultural support. The government has once again avoided populism, continuing its emphasis on fiscal consolidation and a capex push. Despite the much-talked-about hikes in LTCG (Long Term Capital Gains)/STCG (Short Term Capital Gains) tax rates and the increase in STT (Securities Transaction Tax) on F&O transactions, these changes are expected to have minimal impact on cash equity and F&O trading volumes. The removal of indexation benefits for capital gains in real estate appears negative. However, we believe this change will not significantly affect primary housing demand, as more than half of the demand is driven by upgrade, and 20-30 percent by first-time homebuyers. The budget also had selectively positive impacts on Consumers (rural development, employment generation, custom duty cuts on gold and silver), Utilities (boost to power generation), and Specialty Chemicals (increase in BCD for certain minerals). We anticipate the market to quickly discount the budget and shift its focus to the trajectory of corporate earnings growth, which has so far remained marginally below our expectations in Q1FY25. We continue to expect 15%+ earnings growth for Nifty over FY24-26. Nifty's Valuations align with its LPA (long-period average) at 20.4x one-year forward earnings. What is your rating for the budget out of 10 and why? 9 out of 10. Four reasons: 1) Continuation of fiscal policy, 2) continued focus on infrastructure, 3) further support to states to allow ground-level work (including infra), 4) fiscal deficit consolidation path intact and very credible now. 1 mark is cut for missing out an opportunity to support consumption growth. Where do you want to put your money especially after the budget? We don’t see any major changes based on the budget and continue to remain positive on Industrials and Capex, Consumer Discretionary, Real Estate, and PSU Banks. We remain OW (overweight) on PSU Banks, Consumption, Industrials, and Real Estate. We recently raised IT to marginal OW from UW (underweight) and cut Auto from OW to UW. We also turned OW on Healthcare from Neutral, while maintaining UW on Private Banks and Energy in our recently released Q1FY25 earnings preview in July 2024. Is it (LTCG, STCG, STT increase) a big concern for investors and equity markets? Its certainly been a dampener as it was not in the expectations. STT has been increased in the past as well but volumes have continued to rise unabated. The quantum of STT increase in F&O is not material enough for volumes to get impacted. Post-tax returns of equities will still beat other competitive products by a wide margin and hence we believe the impact will not be material. Can the budget give more boost to the financial services sector? The Union Budget 2024 was broadly neutral for the banking sector, with the government clearly emphasizing credit availability for MSMEs. The government proposed measures to ensure credit availability to MSMEs in the SMA category for reasons beyond their control and suggested that PSBs develop in-house capabilities to assess MSMEs for credit disbursement. While there were changes in capital gains and minor adjustments to other taxes, the government did not reduce the tax rate on term deposits, which could have helped banks increase deposit growth—a current challenge for the banking system. Nevertheless, we maintain a positive outlook on the sector, supported by strong balance sheets and healthy profitability. Do you expect the higher chance of sovereign rating upgrade in future after budget? We definitely hope so. India’s handling of macro crises in the recent past has been exemplary. Indian economy has come out with flying colours from the pandemic. Not only we didn’t face as much high inflation as most other major world economies, but our fiscal deficit consolidation (central or combined with states) in the last 2-3 years has also been very remarkable with no adverse impact on growth. Even in an election year government had presented a budget without any populist measures, further bolstering India’s credentials on fiscal front.

"MC Interview: Rural consumption unlikely to grow in a hurry, although budget increased allocation to rural schemes, says Sandeep Bagla",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/mc-interview-rural-consumption-unlikely-to-grow-in-a-hurry-although-budget-increased-allocation-to-rural-schemes-says-sandeep-bagla-12780114.html,Market,"July 27, 2024 07:48 PM","The Budget increased the allocation to rural schemes from before, but one cannot expect it to make a significant boost to rural income on its own, Sandeep Bagla, CEO of TRUST Mutual Fund said in an interview with Moneycontrol. According to him, rural consumption has been lacklustre due to factors like high food inflation and weather-related vagaries and is not expected to grow in a hurry. On the abolition of the Angel tax, ""It is a much-needed step as it eases the process of raising funds and reduces the ambiguities related to start-up funding,"" said Sandeep, who has over 25 years of experience in financial markets. Is it a tough budget for investors, good for jobs, and high on political priorities? The Budget is tough for investors in the sense that they will now have to fork out a greater portion of their capital gains as tax, as compared to before. The benefits of indexation have also been removed. The principle that the investor needs to pay tax on the real gains over and above inflation has been done away with. It would be a little more difficult for investors now to have a balanced asset allocation as there are hardly any incentives to invest in debt and fixed-income funds from a tax perspective. Can the Budget significantly boost rural consumption? There is some emphasis on the skilling of the labour force and a push towards an increase in the participation of women in the workforce. While it is difficult for the Government to create jobs overnight, steps have been taken in the right direction like the provision of paid internships and focus on benefits to employees and employers for first-time EPFO contributors. For economic growth to sustain/increase in the coming years, reforms in the labour market to enable greater job creation could prove to be a critical area of policymaking. The Budget increased the allocation to rural schemes from before, but one cannot expect it to make a significant boost to rural income on its own. Rural consumption has been lacklustre due to factors like high food inflation and weather-related vagaries and is not expected to grow in a hurry. A number of steps would have to be taken outside the budget announcements to boost rural income and bolster rural demand. Do you think the capex target should have increased significantly from the current Rs 11.11 lakh crore when the private capex is yet to pick up? The Government's primary objective is governance and creating conditions conducive for growth to pick up. The existing capex spending is in the hope to kick start the investment cycle and a wish that the private sector picks up the baton at some point in time. The Government has rightly refrained from increasing the capex spend as there is a limit on the effective absorption of the spend in the appropriate sectors as well and further increases would put a strain on the fiscal as well. Has the Union Budget provided enough structural measures to boost the economy? While there has been improved tax collection and higher-than-expected dividends from the RBI, the Government has utilized the extra revenue to reduce the fiscal deficit and allocate some resources for achieving higher growth. More structural changes are needed in key inputs like land, labour, capital, and technology to ensure the continuance of output growth in future years. Hopefully, such changes will be gradually announced and implemented over the next few months outside the Budget announcements. Has the Union Budget given enough confidence to the financial services sector? While issues like inadequate deposit growth in the banking system have been raised in the last few months, the Union Budget has not addressed the issue directly. The increase in STT (Securities Transaction Tax) has increased the cost of speculation through derivatives. A rise in short-term capital gains could discourage short-term parking in money market funds and indirectly channelise resources towards the banking sector. All in all, the Budget has not been incrementally positive for the financial sector. Is the big stress out for startups with the abolition of the Angel Tax? Abolition of the Angel tax is a much-needed step as it eases the process of raising funds and reduces the ambiguities related to start-up funding.

ALSO READ: IndusInd Bank forecasts 4-6% impact from RBI's new draft LCR norms The new guidelines mandate banks to hold more liquidity for deposits made through digital channels, as these are considered less stable and more likely to be withdrawn quickly. The RBI has proposed increasing the run-off factor on retail deposits made via Internet and mobile banking (IMB) from the current 5 percent to 10 percent. Typically, the run-off factor on retail deposits is lower because they are considered stable. Run-offs occur when individuals or businesses withdraw their deposits unexpectedly. Under the new guidelines, stable retail deposits with internet and mobile banking will have a 10 percent run-off factor, and less stable deposits will have a 15 percent run-off factor. The banking industry views this move as conservative, as it would require banks to invest more in government securities and slow down credit growth. Given that system liquidity is tight and deposit mobilisation is already slow, the impact on banks will be significant. They will need to keep deposit rates high and temper growth to align with funding. Regarding the loan-to-deposit ratio, ICICI Bank does not foresee a significant change. ""We have historically operated at a low to mid-80s domestic LDR. I don't see any big change in that. It may vary slightly from quarter to quarter, but overall, it should remain at that level for both deposit and loan growth,"" they added. In the quarter ending in June, ICICI Bank reported a 16 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in domestic loans, while average deposits increased by 18 percent YoY. The private lender's net profit grew by 14.6 percent YoY to Rs 11,059 crore in Q1FY25, and net interest income rose by 7.3 percent YoY to Rs 19,552 crore.

"Jigar Patel of Anand Rathi says 24,860 crucial for further rally in Nifty, bets on these 3 stocks for healthy returns",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jigar-patel-of-anand-rathi-says-24860-crucial-for-further-rally-in-nifty-betson-these-3-stocks-for-healthy-returns-12780091.html,Market,"July 27, 2024 07:06 PM","By Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi The Indian markets experienced a highly eventful week (ended July 26), largely influenced by the Union Budget 2024. The Nifty corrected towards the 24,000 mark as the budget sparked some disappointment among investors, and by Thursday, the FII’s long-to-short ratio had decreased to 57 percent. By Friday, market sentiment had reversed dramatically, with bullish investors driving the index to a new all-time high of 24,861, which resulted into a gain of over 1 percent compared to the previous week's close. Looking ahead, if the Nifty moves above 24,860, it could potentially reach the significant milestone of 25,000 and possibly higher. At that juncture, we would need to reassess the market conditions and develop a new trading strategy, particularly considering the risk of negative divergence in the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI). On the downside, the 24,400 level is expected to provide strong support for the coming week; any breach of this level could weaken the current momentum. The Nifty Bank index continued to underperform relative to the broader market benchmarks. The Union Budget 2024 did not provide substantial support for the banking sector, leading to its underperformance. According to our analysis, the index approached the 50,000 mark by Thursday’s session but found support at the trendline breakout extension, which prompted a sharp rebound during Friday’s session. Moving forward, a breach of the 50,000 level could indicate further pessimism for the index. Otherwise, we expect a continued recovery for the Bank Nifty, with potential upward movement towards the 52,000-52,500 range in the coming sessions. Here are three stocks to pick for short term: IDFC First Bank | CMP: Rs 74.5  After reaching a peak near Rs 101 in September 2023, IDFC First Bank experienced a substantial correction of Rs 30, translating to a 29.34 percent decline from its high. Recently, the stock found support near the 0.618 retracement level of its previous upmove from 53 to 101. Additionally, a bullish BAT pattern has formed precisely at this 0.618 retracement level, making the current levels attractive for buying. Based on these technical indicators, buying in the Rs 72-75 zone is recommended. The target price is set at Rs 84, with a stop-loss placed near Rs 68.5 on a daily close basis. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 84 Stop-Loss: Rs 68.5 Cipla | CMP: Rs 1,575  Apart from the previous trading session, Cipla has been trading within a narrow price range of Rs 1,485-Rs 1,535. This indicates a period of consolidation, where the stock's price has been relatively stable and moving sideways. However, during the previous trading session, Cipla decisively broke above this range with massive volume, suggesting further bullish momentum. On the indicator front, the RSI has reversed from the 50 level, which further affirms our bullish bias. Therefore, we recommend buying Cipla during pullbacks near Rs 1,525-1,540 range, targeting an upside of Rs 1,635. To manage risk, a stop-loss should be set near Rs 1,495 on a daily close basis. Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone | CMP: Rs 1,543  Excluding the previous trading session, Adani Ports has been trading within a price range of Rs 1,480-Rs 1,520, indicating a period of consolidation where the stock's price has remained relatively stable and moved sideways. However, during the last trading session, Adani Ports decisively broke above this range and closed higher, suggesting further bullish momentum. On the indicator front, the RSI has reversed from the 50 level, which further supports our bullish outlook. Therefore, we recommend buying Adani Ports during pullbacks near Rs 1,530-1,540 range, with a target of Rs 1,650. To manage risk, a stop-loss should be set near Rs 1,480 on a daily close basis.

Commodity investors to focus on FOMC statement next week as markets nearly certain of first rate cut in September,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/commodities/commodity-investors-to-focus-on-fomc-statement-next-week-as-markets-nearly-certain-of-first-rate-cut-in-september-12780107.html,Market,"July 27, 2024 09:24 PM","By Kaynat Chainwala, AVP - Commodity Research at Kotak Securities Tamer US inflation figures provided markets a much needed relief at the end of the turbulent week (ended July 26) marked by political uncertainty, sell-off in global tech shares and serious concerns about Chinese economic recovery. Following a sharp pullback from all-time highs in the previous week, Gold prices briefly recovered and surged above $2400 per troy ounce earlier this week as President Joe Biden's decision to end his re-election campaign and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris prompted speculation on whether it would benefit or hinder Donald Trump's chances of returning to the White House. However, the uptick did not last long as recovery in dollar coupled with markets’ preference of Yen as a safe-haven asset over gold led to sharp retreat in gold to two-week low of $2351.9 per troy ounce. COMEX gold rebounded to $2,389.7 per ounce but closed with a second consecutive weekly loss, while Silver tumbled more than 4 percent this week, in line with weakness in gold and base metals. On the domestic front, decline in gold and silver was steeper at 6.9 percent and 8.9 percent respectively primarily due to the cut in import duty from 15 percent to 6 percent, which exceeded the market's expectations of a 10 percent reduction. Lower prices could potentially stimulate retail demand and prompt increased imports in the medium term. WTI crude prices closed the week lower by 4.4 percent, marking a third consecutive weekly decline as weak Chinese demand prospects and hopes of Gaza ceasefire outweighed the impact of lower US stock levels. Chinese slowdown concerns further hurt the demand outlook amid already declining refinery runs and imports. OPEC+ ministerial meeting due August 1 is likely to attract attention from oil market participants, although no changes to the group's output policy are expected. On the four hourly chart, MCX Crude Oil (August) has witnessed support near its 50 percent ‘Fibonacci Retracement Level’. In addition, MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator has provided a fresh positive crossover affirming positive momentum. Next resistance for the counter is placed at Rs 6,730 per barrel, above which major resistance is placed at Rs 6,880. Losses in base metals deepened this week as recent interest rate cuts by the People’s Bank of China, intended to bolster a struggling economy, failed to boost confidence in the demand outlook, thereby pushing LME Copper, Aluminium to four-month lows and Zinc to lowest levels since April. The upcoming Politburo meeting, scheduled for late July, will be closely watched by investors to see if the government acknowledges economic headwinds and implements more immediate measures to proactively boost domestic demand. Core PCE increased 0.2 percent MoM from May and 2.6 percent from a year ago, slightly exceeding expectations, thereby pushing July rate cut off the table. However, impact of the same was muted on dollar and most commodities as moderating inflation and a cooler labour market kept markets nearly certain of the first rate cut in September. Investors will now turn their attention to the upcoming FOMC statement and key economic data next week for additional guidance on future monetary policy. Bank of Japan policy decision will also be closely watched amid tightening expectations, contrasting with anticipated rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank.

"Trading Plan: Will Nifty consolidate before climbing towards 25,000, Bank Nifty reclaim 51,800?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trading-plan-will-nifty-consolidate-before-climbing-towards-25000-bank-nifty-reclaim-51800-12779847.html,Market,"July 27, 2024 05:33 PM","Bulls staged a spectacular performance on July 26, the first day of the August series, taking the Nifty beyond 24,800 for the first time on a closing basis. The strong momentum raised hopes for a move towards 25,000, provided the index defends 24,600 in the coming sessions. Until then, it may consolidate around current levels. The Bank Nifty needs to climb and sustain above 51,800, the key hurdle, for a further sharp upmove; until then, it may consolidate with 51,000 support, experts said. On Friday, the Nifty 50 surged 429 points or 1.76 percent to 24,835, and the Bank Nifty rallied 407 points or 0.8 percent to 51,296, forming a long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts. During the week, the former gained 1.24 percent while the latter lost 1.86 percent. On the NSE, 1,593 shares advanced, while 756 shares declined. Nifty Outlook and Strategy Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst at Angel One The weekly winning streak continued for the eighth consecutive week, technically discarding last week’s bearish 'Shooting Star' formation on the weekly chart and 'Bearish Engulfing' on the daily chart. During the week, the 20EMA (Exponential Moving Average) provided support during several attempts, and now a higher bottom formation is visible around it on the daily chart. This swing low of 24,070 and the base formation around 24,200 are pivotal levels for the Nifty 50; as long as these levels hold, optimism is expected to continue, with markets targeting new milestones. On the flip side, the index can first aim to test the psychological level of 25,000 and then the 161.8 percent retracement of last week’s (ending July 26) swing at 25,340. Immediate support can be seen around 24,600. Momentum has definitely picked up for the bulls again, but one should avoid complacency as momentum indicators are still trading in overbought territory. Friday's rally was primarily fueled by short covering, causing Call writers to scramble. We are now seeing a substantial buildup in out-of-the-money (OTM) Puts, suggesting a buy-on-dip market and an advancing demand zone. The highest open interest (OI) in OTM Puts is at 24,500, with significant formation also observed at 24,700, indicating immediate support levels. Conversely, the highest OI in OTM Calls is at the psychological 25,000 strike, followed by the 25,500 Call, signaling the next resistance level. Key Resistance: 25,000, 25,130, 25,340 Key Support: 24,600, 24,530, 24,400 Strategy: Traders can continue with the flow of the current positive momentum, and any dip should be considered a buying opportunity. Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities On the weekly chart, the index has formed a bullish candle with a lower shadow, indicating buying at lower support levels. The chart pattern suggests that if Nifty crosses and sustains above the 25,000 level, it would witness buying, leading the index towards the 25,300-25,500 levels. However, if the index breaks below the 24,600 level, it would witness selling, taking the index towards the 24,400-24,200 levels. For the week, we expect Nifty to trade in the range of 24,400-25,500 with a positive bias. The weekly strength indicator RSI (Relative Strength Index) is moving upwards and is quoting above its reference line, indicating a positive bias. Key Resistance: 24,900, 25,100 Key Support: 24,650, 24,500 Strategy: Buy Nifty near 24,700 with a stop-loss of 24,600 and a target of 24,950-25,100. Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical and Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities The Nifty 50 has been consistently making higher tops and higher bottoms over the last several weeks, and it is trading above a rising 20 and 50-week SMA. This suggests that the intermediate uptrend looks set to continue. We expect any corrections to hold above the 24,595 support level as the intermediate uptrend continues for the time being. Our intermediate upside target is 25,100. In terms of strategy, traders/investors are advised to adopt a selective buying approach with a strict stop-loss to control risk. Key Resistance: 24,920, 25,100 Key Support: 24,595, 24,410 Strategy: Buy Nifty near 24,850, with a stop-loss of 24,650, and a target of 25,100. Bank Nifty - Outlook and Positioning Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst at Angel One Bank Nifty faced challenges throughout the week but showed strength on Friday, aligning with broader market trends. It defended the key support of the 50-day EMA and ended its recent losing streak. However, prices remain below the 20-day EMA, and clear signs of strength are not yet visible in this sector. For the coming week, the 52,000 - 52,200 range is seen as a key hurdle; surpassing this could lead to significant positive traction. Meanwhile, the 50,500 - 50,400 range is identified as immediate support. On the options front, there isn’t a significant build-up noticeable. The highest open interest in OTM Call options is at 53,000, with 52,000 also serving as a key resistance level. On the other hand, there is considerable build-up in OTM Put options at 51,000, suggesting immediate support levels. Key Resistance: 51,800, 52,000, 52,300 Key Support: 51,000, 50,800, 50,400 Strategy: This sector is underperforming and is playing catch-up with the broader markets. It's advisable not to chase momentum here; instead, consider buying any dips, provided the week’s low of around 50,400 is maintained. Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities On the weekly chart, the index has formed a bearish candle with shadows on either side, representing extreme volatility on both sides. The chart pattern suggests that if Bank Nifty crosses and sustains above the 51,600 level, it would witness buying, leading the index towards the 51,800-52,000 levels. However, if the index breaks below the 51,000 level, it would witness selling, taking the index towards the 50,750-50,500 levels. For the week, we expect Bank Nifty to trade in the range of 50,500-52,000 with a mixed bias. The weekly strength indicator RSI and momentum oscillator Stochastic have both turned negative from the overbought zone and are below their respective reference lines, indicating a profit booking. Key Resistance: 51,600, 51,850 Key Support: 51,000, 50,800 Strategy: Buy Bank Nifty near 51,000 with a stop-loss of 50,800 and a target of 51,550-51,700. Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical and Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities Bank Nifty bounced back from the 50-day SMA, which bodes well for the index in the coming week. The index could rise further once the immediate resistance of 51,516 is taken out. Momentum indicators like the 14-day RSI have also bounced back from oversold levels. Key Resistance: 51,399, 51,516 Key Support: 51,136, 50,863 Strategy: Buy Bank Nifty near 51,353, with a stop-loss of 50,800, and a target of 52,000.

A spike in the effective tax rate of 26 percent in Q1 of FY25 as compared to 24 percent in the base quarter kept net profit largely flattish on year. Coming to revenue, the company attributed its growth to the uptick in generics sales in North America as well as India. Growth in global generics sales came at 15 percent on year, primarily volume led, aided by new launches and integration of recently in-licensed vaccine portfolio in India, partially offset by price erosion. Despite that, the company's operating performance witnessed some contraction as EBITDA margin came at 28.2 percent, lower than the 29 percent reported in the same quarter last year. This was largely due to increased research and development expenses which made up 8.1 percent of the total revenue, up from 7.4 percent in the year ago period. The R&D investments are focused towards biosimilars pipeline, development efforts across generics as well as novel oncology assets, which will support future growth.

After all, we are talking of a $3.3 trillion economy with approximately 40  percent of the households in the low-income category, a growing middle class, and a small percent in the high-income bracket (22 percent of the national income goes to the top 1 percent). The country also has the fastest growing youth population. It’s a complex situation. The union budget has in many ways taken a step in the right direction, ensuring policy continuity. One hopes that will be maintained. Tax tweaks every now and then are avoidable. Capex or effective capex? Let’s dive into the capex. While the capex of Rs 11.1 trillion has been kept unchanged from the interim budget,  there’s more within the effective capex. The Internal and Extra Budgetary Resources( IEBR) are available to Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) for capex, and include loans and equity. This also adds to capex in the economy. Thus, the combined capex growth rate is now 16 percent, with a mix that is more favourable than FY18.  In April-May 2024, we spent Rs 1.4 trillion in capex, which means budgetary support of Rs 9.7 trillion is expected between June 2024 to March 2025. The IEBR /GDP ratio, currently at 1.1 percent, is likely to increase slightly in the coming years amid investments in green energy-focussed PSUs. Looking at the ministries that have been the focus of this budget, it is evident that we are envisioning Viksit Bharat 2047 around nine themes. Unprecedented outlays Some of these allocations have been rather unprecedented and shows that new-age opportunities such as semiconductor fabs are a priority. Expenditure on research and innovation has a huge multiplier impact on the economy.  With such historic allocations, it is clear that India is trying to prepare itself for the future. For instance, the ‘Modified Programme for Development of Semiconductors and Display Manufacturing Ecosystem in India’ alone has seen its allocation go up from Rs 15 billion in FY24 to Rs 69 billion in FY25. This shows India’s commitment to expanding the value chain in this space. Similarly, the Rs 100 billion allocation for employment schemes is a step in the right direction to address the country’s employment problem. For India to grow continuously at 8 percent, focus on employment is a must.  We will see our demographic dividend only if we  generate jobs. Also, job creation and skilling go hand-in-hand. Therefore, spending money on creating an infrastructure for skill development is complementary to job creation. Further, India has  a problem of a low income tax base, which means the few who pay taxes need to pay more. By incentivising the formalisation of the economy through the supply side, the stimulus has been aligned well for a progressive move to the organised sector. Reducing customs duties on marine products, mobile phone parts, and precious metals helps reduce the cost of imports. India can then continue to add value to these items and export, which increases the competitiveness of the country globally. India is getting ready to seize the long-term opportunity today. It is good to have a budget that focusses on the big picture. Growing FPI interest India has had the problem of not being able to borrow enough as it never had enough ‘buyers of first resort.’ The inclusion of bonds in foreign indices has changed that, with a meaningful increase in FPI holdings. In FY25, the demand for government securities is estimated to be a strong Rs 18 trillion. If that continues, market borrowings are unlikely to be a problem .  The reason the government’s  borrowings haven’t shrunk despite the fall in the fiscal deficit is the reduced mobilisation of small savings, which in turn has led to  pressure on bank deposits. However, debt markets have many tailwinds.  The case for demand outstripping supply can be structurally positive. India’s currency has been under pressure. FDI has fallen to a mere $9 billion last year. Reduction of tax on foreign companies from 40 to 35 percent is one way to fuel it. We exported agri goods worth $48 billion in FY24, and electronic goods worth $30 billion, which includes mobile phones worth ~$17 billion. Though India’s vast export potential is relatively untapped, the policy steps are  designed to make India’s exports more competitive in the long run. Value-added exports are the future for India. Finally, the gravity of the employment crisis is hard to measure. It’s innate and rising as fast as the youth population, if not faster. The government’s focus on skill and job creation is a good thing. We need an ecosystem that feeds people. Trickle-down economics will continue to favour India.

During the week, the BSE Midcap, LargeCap and Smllcap indices rose 3 percent, 1.5 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively. In this week, BSE Sensex rose 728.07 points or 0.90 percent to finish at 81,332.72, while Nifty50 index added 303.9 points or 1.23 percent to end at 24,834.80. On July 26, Nifty50 index touched fresh record high of 24,861.15, while BSE Sensex also went near to its record high of 81587.76. On the sectoral front, BSE Power, Healthcare and Auto indices rose 5 percent each, BSE Telecom index added 4 percent and BSE oil & Gas index rose 3.4 percent. On the other hand, BSE Bank index shed 2.5 percent and Realty index fell 1.7 percent. ""The Budget 2024-25 has not sparked any significant excitement in the market, while it was both populist and prudent. The increase in short- and long-term capital gains taxes added to the volatility on budget day. Many of the measures are a reiteration of the interim budget, and the broader market appears to be losing momentum due to a lack of new impetus. Although the government's emphasis on fiscal discipline and growth is appealing, FIIs are cautious due to current high valuations and muted expectations for Q1FY25 results. Meanwhile, DIIs continue to employ a ""buy on dips"" strategy, which contributed to market gains on the week's last trading day, particularly in the pharma, auto, metal, IT, and FMCG sectors,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services. ""The market has now recovered its losses from budget day, driven by positive US GDP data and expectations of improved global demand. Moving forward, the direction of the domestic market will likely be influenced by the progress of the earnings season. Additionally, global economic updates, including US Fed & BoE monetary policies, US employment data, and Eurozone GDP figures, are expected to impact market trends,"" he added.

On the other hand, Ircon International, KSolves India, Phoenix Mills, VST Industries, Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers lost between 10-13 percent.  Where is Nifty50 headed? Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities The immediate supports like 10/20-day EMAs have been regained after violating below it recently. These moving averages have been offering supports for the Nifty in the last 5-6 weeks. The positive chart pattern like higher tops and bottoms is intact on the daily chart and Nifty seems to have confirmed a new higher bottom formation recently. The short-term trend of Nifty has turned into positive. The next upside levels to be watched around 25000-25100 in the near term. Immediate support is placed at 24650 levels. Jatin Gedia – Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas This current upmove can extend towards 25350 – 25530. Support base now stands at 24400 which is the 20-day moving average. The daily momentum indicator still has a negative crossover however we shall assign more weightage to the price action and ride the up move. Tejas Shah, Technical Research, JM Financial & BlinkX We expect an upward trending activity to continue and the index should move towards the next psychological resistance of 25,000 either continuously from the current levels or may be after a minor dip. The short term moving averages are also below the price action and should continue to support the indices on any decline. Support for the Nifty is now seen at 24,650 and 24,450-500 levels. On the higher side, immediate resistance for Nifty is at 24,850 levels and the next psychological resistance is at 25,000 mark.

How to approach sideways market with Options: Shubham Agarwal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/expert-columns/how-to-approach-sideways-market-with-options-shubham-agarwal-12779600.html,Market,"July 27, 2024 10:32 AM","Shubham Agarwal Since the beginning of the pre-budget worries earlier this month, indices have been fairly range-bound. This has created a bit of difficulty for many trend followers. It is difficult to profit out of this tight range especially once we are in it for a week or so. Now you do not know how long it is going to last. We are within the range or at the edge. Either of the cases has its own difficulties and very low success rate. But when we match it with Options trades with fairly high success rates, it all works out. Let us see how: 1. Trading range breakout with back ratio spreads This strategy involves selling one Option with strike closer to current market price and buying not one but 2 Options of Higher Strike Call (against Call Sold), or Lower Strike Puts (against Puts Sold). With back ratio of the break takes place, one would end up making good money after a big move due to the very fact that there are 2 Options bought against one sold. On the other hand, if the volatility is on the other side and if the big opposite move sets in, all options will start reducing towards zero. This would be ok too because net premium outflow if all goes to zero is also negligible. Only caution is the big view of volatility. If volatility does not come around in next couple of days then get rid of the trade. Again, the cost of carrying the trade for 2-3 sessions would not be so much. Also, make sure there is at least a week left for the expiry. 2. Contra trades within the range with OTM spreads When previous trend is bullish and we feel the consolidation could end up in break-down, do OTM Spreads. For a bearish trade one does a Put spread. OTM Spreads are created by buying slightly lower Strike Put and selling further lower strike Put. Benefit of this strategy is the initial outflow (net premium paid) is low. Max profit, which is difference between the strikes minus the premium paid is generally 2-3 times the maximum loss of Net Premium paid. We are saved in case of few days of consolidation before the reverse move since we have one option bought against one sold. Most importantly, in case we are proven wrong with no chance to exit at desired stop loss level the max loss is limited. 3. Reversal moves with intraday long Options Typically, we end up on a day in the market where things look overdone. Such is the situation that calls for intraday trade in favour of range. Bullish trade in a highly oversold market and bearish in an overbought market. Here is where instead of Buying a Future go long (buy) on a Call / Put for bullish / bearish trade. If everything works out and the reversal takes place, we make our quick buck. If the market continues with the direction, the cost of taking a brave trade is small. Only thing is one must keep it time bound. Close the trade during the day or next day.

"Wall Street closes up on revival supported by inflation data, tech stocks",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/wall-street-closes-up-on-revival-supported-by-inflation-data-tech-stocks-12779914.html,Market,"July 27, 2024 10:25 AM","Wall Street's major indexes ended higher on Friday as investors flocked back to tech megacaps that had triggered broad sell-offs earlier in the week, and inflation data boosted optimism that the Federal Reserve will soon commence cutting interest rates. For the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, the advances could not completely recoup the ground lost in the two previous sessions, with both indexes ending the week lower for the second consecutive week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended in positive territory for the week. Its Friday gains were aided by industrial conglomerate 3M, which jumped 23% to its largest daily percentage gain in decades after it raised the lower end of its annual adjusted profit forecast. Five members of the so-called Magnificent Seven rose on Friday, led by Meta Platforms which climbed 2.7%. The two exceptions were Tesla and Alphabet, whose lackluster earnings had triggered Wednesday's big market sell-off. They both fell 0.2%, with Alphabet dropping to its lowest close since May 2. With further Magnificent Seven earnings due next week, the immediate outlook for markets may hinge on what type of results these companies deliver. ""What we get next week from Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com and Meta is really going to set the tone for whether that rotation continues and, directionally, where the market goes,"" said Greg Boutle, head of US equity & derivative strategy at BNP Paribas. The rotation involves moving out of a set of high-momentum stocks, whose valuations now appear inflated, to underperforming sectors like mid- and small-cap stocks. This shift seems to have gained momentum in recent weeks, with the small-cap Russell 2000 (.RUT), opens new tab and S&P Small Cap 600 both advancing to their fourth closing highs of the week. The Russell 2000 scored its third straight weekly gain in two months and its best three-week run since August 2022. These economically sensitive small-caps were supported on Friday by the moderate rise in June U.S. prices, which underlined cooling inflation and potentially positions the Fed to start easing policy in September. Bets on a 25-basis-point cut at the Fed's September meeting held steady at about 88% after the PCE reading, according to CME's FedWatch. Traders still largely expect two rate cuts by December, LSEG data showed. ""We did see (the stable economic data) as beneficial for that broadening trade,"" said Adam Hetts, global head of multi-asset at Janus Henderson, noting small-caps had outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 10% over the last month. The broadening trade has also benefited cyclical sectors of the economy. On Friday, all 11 of the S&P sectors were higher, with Industrials and Materials the leading gainers. On Friday, the S&P 500 gained 59.88 points, or 1.11%, at 5,459.10 points, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 176.16 points, or 1.03%, to 17,357.88. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 654.27 points, or 1.64%, to 40,589.34. For the week, the Dow gained 0.75%, while the S&P 500 declined 0.82% and the Nasdaq dropped 2.08%. Among stocks boosted by earnings, Deckers Outdoor jumped 6.3% after it raised its annual profit forecast, while oilfield services firm Baker Hughes climbed 5.8% after beating estimates for second-quarter profit. Norfolk Southern soared 10.9%, its largest one-day percentage gain since March 2020, after the rail operator reported second-quarter profit above Wall Street estimates thanks to robust pricing. Medical device maker Dexcom slumped 40.6% after cutting its annual revenue forecast. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.92 billion shares, compared with the 11.61 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Moneycontrol Pro Weekender: When markets laugh,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/moneycontrol-pro-weekender-when-markets-laugh-12779709.html,Market,"July 27, 2024 10:00 AM","Dear Reader, You can’t keep a good market down. This week, the bears had some big guns with them. On Monday, the Economic Survey sounded the proverbial note of caution by pegging this year’s GDP growth at 6.5-7 percent, lower than RBI’s and the market’s estimates. It harped on the enormous difficulties of growth in a fast-changing and unpredictable global environment, lamented the disruption to jobs from AI and the difficulties of increasing capital spending and exports in today’s virulently geopolitical milieu. We called it a “strong dose of much-needed realism”. For the markets, its warnings were crystal clear. Drawing attention to India’s market capitalisation to GDP ratio being far higher than that of other emerging market economies, it said, “The market capitalisation to GDP ratio is not necessarily a sign of economic advancement or sophistication… If equity market claims on the real economy are excessively high, it is a harbinger of market instability rather than market resilience.” It deplored the entry of large number of young retail traders into the derivatives markets and said, “The financialisation of economies has not ended well, even for advanced economies. The global financial crisis of 2008 is an obvious example. Developing countries face debilitating crises when financial market ‘innovations’ and growth run ahead of economic growth… Therefore, India needs to have an orderly and gradual evolution of the financial market.’’ The Survey added, “India can ill-afford the economy's over financialisation at its current development stage.’’ Those words could have come straight out of “MSME credit. Tuesday brought the Union Budget, which turned out to be a remarkably tame affair. Total expenditure budgeted for FY25, compared to the “Provisional Actuals’’ for FY24 was up 8.5 percent, less than the 10.5 percent nominal GDP growth assumed for the current fiscal. Revenue expenditure minus interest payments was up a mere 4.8 percent, barely beating inflation. So much for a push to consumption. The fiscal deficit is projected to be lower this year, so there’s less of a fiscal stimulus, but note that the fall in the stimulus was much more in FY24 and yet we had 8.2 percent GDP growth. Gaurav Kapur, chief economist at IndusInd Bank, underlined that the Budget stayed the course on fiscal consolidation. But the real story of the Union Budget was not the macro or even its focus on employment, but on the markets. The changes in the capital gains tax and the Securities Transaction Tax unnerved the market, albeit for a very brief while. As if on cue, SEBI came out with a study that said 71 percent of traders in the equity cash segment lose money. We wrote on this report here and here. It did seem as if the finance ministry was trying hard to send a not very subtle message -- it’s time to take some of the froth off the market. My colleague Nitin Agrawal wrote, “the reforms in Budget 2024 reflect a dual objective: promoting long-term investment across diverse asset classes and reducing the dominance of equities in investment portfolios”. Did the equity market listen? It did sulk a bit and the angst among traders was palpable—our newsletter on Wednesday was headlined “No country for Indian traders”-- but they soon shrugged off the woes, laughing at all the pathetic talk of restraint. In Carl Sandburg’s words about Chicago: “Laughing with white teeth, Under the terrible burden of destiny laughing as a young man laughs, Laughing even as an ignorant fighter laughs who has never lost a battle, Bragging and laughing that under his wrist is the pulse, and under his ribs the heart of the people, Laughing! Laughing the stormy, husky, brawling laughter of Youth” By the end of the week, the markets had reached a new high and the Vix had gone back to sleep. You’ve probably been subjected to a barrage of reports on the Union Budget all week, so I won’t add to them, instead moving on quickly to the important topic of how you could profit from it. Our columnist Vijay Bhambwani took the bull by the horns, writing about strategies for traders to thrive in a higher STT regime. Chandu Nair focused on one of the Budget’s few bright spots—the removal of the angel tax—writing that it will “create a more conducive environment for investment and innovation, ultimately strengthening India's position as a global start-up hub”. Our independent research team picked several stocks that would benefit from the Budget’s measures. These include Protean eGov Technologies, which will gain from the Budget’s digital push; CE Info Systems and Genesys International that would profit from the boost to land records management; a water treatment stock—Va Tech Wabag; housing finance stocks; Astra Zeneca, which benefits from the scrapping of customs duty on cancer drugs; stocks that benefit from the reduction in duty on leather imports; and this infrastructure stock. On Wednesday, the Nasdaq dropped the most in 18 months, with the markets wondering how long the tech majors would have to wait to collect the payoff on their AI bets. The CME Fedwatch tool says there’s an 89 percent probability of the first rate cut being in September and more than 50 percent probability of three 25 basis point rate cuts by December. My colleague Vatsala Kamat wrote in this newsletter headlined “this old Beatles song?’’ that rate cuts benefit smaller companies more, “as some of them could have bigger debt burdens than large-cap ones. This perhaps exacerbated the fall in overheated tech stocks as investors took cognisance of a larger menu they could choose from”. Markets across the world felt the aftershocks of the Nasdaq fall, but not the irrepressible Indian markets. Perhaps both the US and Indian markets reflect solid fundamentals. The Flash Purchasing Managers Index for India for July shows very strong growth momentum, albeit with higher selling price inflation. For the US, the Flash PMI showed output accelerating in July, while prices rose at a slower rate.

"VAT hike on jet fuel, increased airport fees creating inflationary environment: IndiGo",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/vat-hike-on-jet-fuel-increased-airport-fees-creating-inflationary-environment-indigo-12779768.html,Market,"July 26, 2024 09:35 PM","India’s largest airline IndiGo on July 26 said that some states increasing the value added tax (VAT) on jet fuel or aviation turbine fuel along with airports in the country hiking certain airport fees is creating an inflationary environment for the airline. ""Currently, we are experiencing a higher inflationary environment... it is across the board, we are experiencing. Nonetheless, we are looking at ways to control the costs,"" the company's management said during the airline's post-earnings conference call. At the start of 2024, the state governments of Goa and Andhra Pradesh hiked the VAT on ATF prices. While Goa has hiked VAT on ATF from 8 percent to 15 percent per kilo-litre, Andhra Pradesh has increased the tax on ATF from 5 percent to 10 percent. Similarly, around 13 major airports in India have increased the user development fees (UDF), a levy designed to bridge revenue shortfall and ensure fair returns for airports. The fee, which varies from airport to airport, is collected by the airline, and passed on to the airport operator. Airports at Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Mangalore, Thiruvananthapuram, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Lucknow, Kannur, Kochi, Chennai, Kozhikode, Kolkata, Goa, Bhubaneswar, Patna, and Srinagar have raised UDF in a range of 2 percent to 200 percent in 2024-25, the Civil Aviation Ministry said in response to a question in Parliament earlier this week. However, IndiGo's management said the upcoming Noida International airport is positioning itself to capture growth of the aviation market around Delhi-NCR with policies like lower VAT rates and other airport fees. ""Clearly Noida Airport is positioning itself, at least per the information we have today, to take a significant share of that growth from Delhi-NCR,"" the airline's management said. The second airport coming up in Delhi-NCR's Jewar is expected to benefit from significantly lower VAT on aviation fuel. The existing airport catering to Delhi-NCR, in Gurugram, Haryana, charges a value added tax of 25 percent on aviation turbine fuel, while the tax at the new airport will be about 1 percent. Airlines spend 35-40 percent of their total expenditure on fuel. IndiGo, in Q1FY25, posted a profit of Rs 2,736 crore, down 11.5 percent as compared to a net profit of Rs 3,090.6  crore in the same period a year ago, mainly due to a 22.7 percent rise in the airline' aircraft fuel expenses which rose to Rs 6,416.5 crore. When compared year-on-year, ATF prices in April 2024 stood at Rs 100893.63 per kilo litre, 2.6 percent higher than Rs 98349.59 per kilo litre in April 2023. Similarly, jet fuel prices in June 2024 stood at Rs 94969.01 per kilo litre, which is 6.34 percent higher when compared to Rs 89303.09/kl in the same period in 2023.

""The new Boeing 737 Max are going to be operated the same way we are operating the wide body Boeing aircraft 777 with Turkish Airways,"" said Gaurav Negi, the airline's chief financial officer, while addressing a post-earnings conference call on July 26. He added that IndiGo will train its cabin crew to operate these aircraft but the pilots will be from Qatar Airways. As part of the agreement, Qatar Airways will be responsible for the maintenance of the aircraft, while the cabin crew will be from IndiGo. The aircraft will be operated between India and Qatar, the airline's management added. Damp lease, an arrangement under which the lessor provides an aircraft along with cockpit crew and maintenance to the airline, is costlier than a normal lease. In February, Moneycontrol had reported that IndiGo plans to lease as many as 20 aircraft from April to partly make up for capacity lost due to the grounding of over 70 planes in its fleet. IndiGo is expected to onboard six Boeing 737 Max aircraft from Qatar Airways and three Boeing 737 Max planes from Ryanair. IndiGo has already operated Boeing 777 planes wet-leased by Turkish Airlines for flights between India and Istanbul. They’ve also wet-leased about a dozen Airbus A320 planes from a European carrier. IndiGo, India’s biggest carrier in terms of domestic market share and fleet, has said that its grounded fleet will start returning to the air soon. The grounded aircraft include planes either waiting for parts due to supply-chain challenges or undergoing inspections after Pratt & Whitney recalled hundreds of PW1100G engines. In July of last year, Pratt & Whitney announced that expedited inspections were necessary due to a rare powder metal issue that might cause some engine components in the twin-engine Airbus A320neo to break. It is anticipated that between 2023 and 2026, 600–700 Airbus aircraft will be grounded as a result of the examinations. IndiGo has also leased some older Airbus A320ceo planes on medium term basis or for around two-three years to help combat the issue of grounded planes, the company's management said. In Q1FY25 IndiGo inducted two additional Airbus A320ceo planes, which are 15 percent less fuel efficient. Despite the grounded aircraft, IndiGo is confident of meeting its capacity growth guidance, the airline's management stressed during the conference call. They expect IndiGo's fleet to grow 10-15 percent in FY25 as compared to FY24. The airline had 382 aircraft in its fleet at the end of the quarter, up from 367 in the previous quarter. IndiGo operated at a peak of 2,029 daily flights during the quarter including non-scheduled flights.

The companies are free to refile their prospectus as early as Monday. Vishal Mega Mart had filed its draft prospectus under confidential filing two weeks ago, while Avanse Financial filed its DRHP on June 21. “The reason for sending back the prospectuses was technical queries – it’s not a rejection,” the sources confirmed. “The companies could file the papers back as early as Monday,” one source added. Vishal Mega Mart is supported by a consortium of Kedaara Capital and Partners Group. The company is a leading fashion-led hypermarket chain and intends to raise close to $1 billion from the market.

Backed by Warburg Pincus, the company counts International Finance Corporation, Kedaara Capital, Mubadala Investment Company, and Avendus Future as its prominent investors. Earlier this month, SEBI also kept in “abeyance” the proposed initial share sale of another non-bank lender, SK Finance. Without disclosing the reason, an update on the SEBI website on July 8 stated that the “issuance of observations (has been) kept in abeyance” regarding the IPO of SK Finance.

"PSU workers see more injuries, have fewer trained staff compared to private firms, says report",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/psu-workers-see-more-injuries-have-fewer-trained-staff-compared-to-private-firms-says-report-12779637.html,Market,"July 26, 2024 06:23 PM","Public sector undertakings (PSUs) in FY23 reported significantly higher rates of high-consequence work injuries and fatalities compared to the private sector, according to a latest report by IIAS, a proxy advisory firm. In FY23, PSUs reported an average of 2.4 high-consequence work injuries, compared to 1.7 in the private sector. The disparity extends to fatalities as well, with PSUs experiencing an average of 2.2 fatalities, significantly higher than the 0.8 reported in the private sector. The report considered Nifty 500 companies for the analysis.  High consequence injuries are severe injuries that result in significant and long-lasting impacts on an individual's health. This reason in part can be explained by the nature of the PSU business that tends to focus on the manufacturing sector especially sectors like metals, mining, power, and oil & gas, said the report. Another probable cause is that PSUs lag behind private sector companies in training their workforce, it added. The percentage of workforce trained in PSUs indeed lags behind that of private sector companies as in FY23, only 42 percent of PSU employees received training compared to 71 percent in the private sector.  Average fatalities were the highest in oil, gas, energy, and allied services at 5. Further, average fatalities were at 1.7 for services and 1.3 for utilities, said the report. On Insurance The report said that 327 out of Nifty 500 companies have provided health and accident insurance coverage to all of their workforce including employees and workers. ""As health insurance among workforce increases, average time lost due to injury comes down. This is because workers get the right treatment and are able to resume work within a shorter duration,"" said the report.

Organised gold jewellers retailers to shine brighter as smuggling to come down,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/organised-gold-jewellers-retailers-to-shine-brighter-as-smuggling-to-come-down-12779616.html,Market,"July 26, 2024 05:13 PM","The Union Budget left a lot of people wanting more, but none walked away from Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s announcements happier than jewellery retailers. With the cut in customs duty, gold prices fell sharply, making it more affordable for the customers buying physical gold and would likely increase demand. But that’s not why the organised jewellery players were celebrating. The lower import duties, from 15 percent duty to six percent, narrows the differential between legal and illegally acquired gold thus making unorganised players who hitherto drew competitiveness by accessing smuggled gold less competitive. After the cut in import duty, the organised players may be more competitive vis-à-vis the unorganised players, resulting in a migration of retail customers from latter to established gold retailers. Why does this matter? India is one of the largest consumers of physical gold, ranging from jewellery, bars and coins. The safe haven metal has proven to be a time-tested measure to beat inflation, while serving an ornamental purpose as well. The dual uses make gold an established part of every Indian household. However, India mines less than one percent of the yellow metal but owns around 11 percent of the world’s gold, causing India to be a net importer of gold. However, with the high duty on imports, the price of gold was made more expensive to every member in the supply chain, especially the end consumer. Therefore, customers and local players quickly turned to smuggled gold to fulfil their needs. According to estimates by the World Gold Council, around 160 tonnes of gold is smuggled into the country, as compared to around 800 tonnes of legally imported gold per annum. India quickly became one of the largest smuggling hubs for gold across the globe. Organised players shouted themselves hoarse requesting for government intervention as calls to cut the import duty rang through the exchequer’s halls nonstop, as regulated players were put at a significant disadvantage. The Central government found itself in a tight spot. The tax revenue for gold imports lined the taxman’s pockets, with the government netting Rs 9.82 lakh per kilogram of gold imported. Also, surging gold imports would drive up India’s import bill as demand increased, causing an imbalance. However, the Finance Minister relented and cut the import tax. Slashing the duties will result in Rs 3.93 lakh per kilogram going to the government instead. Overall, the move effectively reduced the overall taxes on gold from around 18.5 percent (including GST) to 9 percent. MP Ahammed, Chairman, Malabar Group, said, “Higher imports will drive up government’s revenues. It curbs revenue loss by making gold smuggling less attractive. More importantly, the increased availability of legally-imported pure gold will enhance the quality of the value-added products like jewellery and ornaments that are meant for exports as well as domestic markets.” Also Read | The Black Day for Gold: How Rs 10 lakh crore wealth got destroyed in a single day All that glitters is not gold While the cut in gold is expected to drive sales for retailers, organised players could actually see losses. According to Nishant Lakkar, founder & CEO, AAA Rating Consultants and Advisors, “Jewellers are likely to post inventory losses given the sharp decline of around 9 percent due to the duty cut, paralleled by a ~5 percent decline in gold prices in dollar terms. ""The double whammy would, in fact, result in large inventory losses to the extent of metal holding (~30-90 days) of jewellers susceptible to movement in gold prices and which can't be passed on to the consumer.” Lakkar added that the cut would only mildly push planned purchases from the festive and wedding seasons. However, it may not have any material impact on the jewellers’ balance sheets to offset the visible inventory losses.

"Sebi finds order exonerating L&T AMC 'erroneous', fines HSBC AMC Rs 5 lakh",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sebi-finds-earlier-order-exonerating-lt-amc-erroneous-fines-hsbc-amc-rs-5-lakh-12779590.html,Market,"July 26, 2024 05:08 PM","The market regulator has imposed a penalty of Rs 5 lakh on HSBC Asset Management (India) on July 25, after finding that an earlier order passed in 2023 exonerating the fund house in an investigation was erroneous. The order pertains to actions by L&T AMC, which was acquired by HSBC Group in May 2023 and merged with HSBC AMC in October 2023. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) was looking into whether the fund house had adequately recorded reasons for its investment decisions, among other things. The examination also looked into the reasons for the sale of three scrips - Hindustan Zinc, Sadbhav Engineering and Vodafone Idea - which resulted in losses worth Rs 1.61 crore, Rs 14.97 crore and Rs 25.43 crore respectively. In total, the losses were over Rs 42 crore. Also read: Filatex Fashions trends on X, market observers suspect pump-and-dump After re-examination, the regulator’s whole-time member Kamlesh C Varshney concluded that the earlier order was ""erroneous to the extent that the same are not in the interests of the securities market."" Background The regulator had issued a show cause notice to HSBC AMC dated November 6, 2023, asking the fund house why an earlier regulatory order dated August 23, 2023, passed by an adjudicating officer should not be examined and revised and penalty not be imposed. The earlier order had been passed after Sebi asked an independent auditor to conduct an inspection on L&T Mutual Fund for the period of April 1, 2019, to March 31, 2021. The inspection report, which was submitted on July 15, 2022, recorded anomalies in the creating and maintaining record and rationale for investment decisions. In the adjudication proceedings, the appointed officer had exonerated the fund house. The order said Sebi's July 2000 circular, which had directions on the details that had to be considered by the AMC while making subsequent investment decisions, lacked clarity. It also said that both MF Regulations and the circular did not have timelines for updating research reports and therefore it may not be right to hold the AMC liable for not updating the report. The order also said that since the AMC submitted that that there was constant monitoring of stocks for the investee companies and in the absence of evidence contrary to this submission, the allegation of lack of due diligence by not updating the research report did not stand established. The adjudicating officer's (AO) order was examined by the regulator to see if it is ""erroneous to the extent it is not in the interest of the securities market"". After this, the regulator made the following observations:The AMC had not produced any record or records detailing the reasons and documents that led to the investment decisions taken in Sadbhav Engineering.Reasons for subsequent decisions, that is, the sale of scrip of Sadbhav Engineering, Hindustan Zinc and Vodafone Idea were not properly recorded other than ""simple recitals"" such as ""need to raise cash for tactical reasons"", ""reducing exposure"" and ""switching to better opportunities"" respectively.Sebi also concluded that the AO had erred in ""merely relying"" on AMC's submission that it was actively tracking the investee companies and has maintained data, facts and opinion leading to its each investment decisions, ""when the same had not got support of any evidence"".Also read: Want to boost your trading profits? Get married, turn 60, and Oh, sorry guys!

"NTPC Q1 Preview: Revenue to grow on increase in power demand, sales",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/ntpc-q1-preview-revenue-to-grow-on-increase-in-power-demand-sales-12779602.html,Market,"July 26, 2024 04:58 PM","NTPC, which is scheduled to announce its earnings for the first quarter of FY25 on July 27, is likely to report a rise in revenue on the back of growth in power demand and generation along with rising commissioning of power projects, even though profits may be under pressure, say analysts. According to a Moneycontrol poll of six brokerages, NTPC is likely to see a marginal increase of 0.07 percent in revenue at Rs 43,424 crore compared to Rs 43,390 crore reported in the same quarter last year.  Further, net profit is likely to fall 3.5 percent to Rs 4,733 crore in the June quarter, from Rs 4,907 crore in the corresponding quarter during the previous fiscal year. The most optimistic estimate sees NTPC’s net profit jumping 9 percent year-on-year, but the most pessimistic projection suggests that net profit will fall around 1.5 percent. What factors are impacting the earnings? Analysts at JM Financial expect NTPC to report a revenue of Rs 44,300 crore in Q1FY25, up 3 percent YoY. The brokerage estimates PAT to rise by 8 percent YoY due to a 10 percent YoY increase in thermal production. Here are some of the factors that can impact earnings: Increase in generation: Analysts at B&K Securities expect Q1FY25 to be a good quarter for NTPC with strong demand in the sector and the peak load increasing to 250 GW in May. ""Per our estimates, PLF for standalone generation remained strong at around 77 percent with gross generation of around 93 billion units, which is 6 percent higher than the same period last year,"" stated a report by the firm. Most brokerages are optimistic about NTPC's growing power generation. “We expect a modest growth in generation at 94 BU (+6 percent yoy) on account of expanded capacity base,” said analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities. Increase in commissioning of projects:  Analysts expect the power generation company to gain from an increase in the number of projects in both the thermal and renewable space. “With rising commissioning of projects in FY25/26 (both thermal and RE) and CERC incentives, we expect FY25 to deliver superior core RoEs vs FY24,” said analysts at Nuvama. What to look out for in the quarterly show? Analysts will closely monitor the management’s commentary on both renewable and thermal capex as well as power generation estimates to meet growing power demand. They will also keep a watch on the planned NTPC Green Energy IPO in September 2024.

ANSR helps companies build, manage, and scale Global Capability Centres (GCCs). On July 26, ANSR and Accenture announced the partnership to help clients design, set up, and optimize global teams for technology and business functions. The amount infused by Accenture stands close to $170 million (approximately Rs 1,400 crores), according to sources in the know. Lalit Ahuja, the founder and CEO of ANSR, said it ""means a lot"" to get Sharma onboard, which reflects the level of commitment from Accenture. ""We have a go-to-market that's about to be rolled out,” Ahuja further said while speaking at the GCC X...Summit 2024 in Bengaluru. A GCC is a dedicated offshore unit established by a company in a foreign country to in-source IT and other related business functions. Ahuja further said that the partnership with redefine and reimagine the way a GCC industry functions. “A lot more to come,” he added. The partnership will include services by Accenture’s technology, data, and AI-powered capabilities and architecture to help clients run their GCCs. This partnership also underscores the growing importance of GCCs in India, as the sector is poised to grow exponentially in the coming years. On July 22, India's Economic Survey 2024 revealed that GCCs by multinational companies are set to contribute roughly 3.5 percent of India’s GDP by 2030, generating an estimated revenue of $121 billion by then. Also read: Revenue of ER&D GCCs grows over 30% to $25 billion in India Meanwhile, Ahuja said the operating model of GCCs integration with peers will be important if the captive unit has to play a meaningful role, going forward. He added that ANSR is working hard to remove the notion that GCCs are an outpost of the global team on top of the subservient organisation. Adding that the next generation of GCCs should essentially become the enterprise. “So they (GCCs) become a lot more mission-oriented and much of what we are trying to do with our partnership with Accenture is to essentially take this concept broadly,” Ahuja said. He also added that a GCC needs unequivocal commitment, sponsorship, and acceptance from the highest levels of the company, right from the board to the CEO. Sameer Dhanrajani, CEO of AI and analytics leaders platform 3Ai, said that the world’s largest IT company investing in ANSR is a commitment from the ecosystem that GCCs are real and it will trigger a chain reaction that will encourage more companies to set up GCCs. “Earlier, these were all silos. GCCs, ANSR, consulting firms, Accenture and KPMGs of the world, now this is all coming together, so the whole ecosystem has become cohesive,” Dhanrajani told Moneycontrol. When asked what the future holds for GCCs in India, Ahuja said CEOs might emerge from these India-based captive centres of global companies in the next three-four years.

The currency was down about 0.1 percent week-on-week, extending its losing streak to the fourth straight week. The slip came amid outflows from local equities, volatility in the Chinese yuan, and expectations that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may allow the currency to weaken slightly as it seeks to correct its overvaluation. Foreign investors have net sold about $1 billion worth of Indian equities since July 23, when the government decided to raise taxes on profits from equity investments and on equity derivative transactions.

The Nifty 50 also managed to scale a new peak in the last minutes of trade. While the Nifty 50 ended the session just shy of its record high of 24861.15 hit a few minutes before close, the Sensex too settled with strong gains. Positive cues from Asian markets combined with a sharp upmove in pharma stocks and other heavyweights helped the two indices record stellar gains. At close, the Sensex was up 1,292.92 points or 1.62 percent at 81,332.72, and the Nifty was up 428.75 points or 1.76 percent at 24,834.85.

This upturn was driven by positive reactions to the better-than-expected US GDP, which augurs well for global demand. Investors are adopting buy on dip strategy, refocusing on quarterly earnings and stock-specific trends. Notably, gains were observed across sectors, with Metals and IT leading, and midcaps outperforming. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities The Nifty has experienced a downward consolidation breakout on the daily chart, suggesting a rise in optimism. A sustained trade above the very short-term moving average, the 21 EMA, gave the index bulls the strength to take the Nifty to new highs amid global market weakness. A fairly large green candle after several insignificant candles clearly signals a bullish trend ahead. The trend might remain positive as long as it stays above 24,500. On the higher end, the index might move towards 25,250.

An insider, who did not want to be named, pointed out that perhaps the Twitter brigade was using the same images they used to make a denim maker's name trend recently. Towards the close of June, various influencers were talking about a denim maker, saying that the company was a multibagger waiting to be discovered. However, the influencers made no mention of the corporate governance issues faced by the company, such as the resignation of the statutory auditor, who claimed that they were not being paid enough for the work that needed to be done. Moneycontrol has written about how social media and influencers' reach are being used frequently to pump and dump stocks. It starts with the operators providing the text of the message that needs to be shared online, which allows them to control the narrative and maximize profits.

Ashish Gupta, Chief Investment Officer at Axis Mutual Fund, believes that the recent hike in long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) to 12.5 percent may be just the beginning. ""To my mind, this looks like a first step. 12.5 percent is an unusual rate, and I wouldn’t be surprised if it moves up to 15 percent by February next year,"" Gupta told Moneycontrol. Gupta noted that while the market has generally accepted the budget, the increase in capital gains tax is a notable point of concern. He highlighted that the tax changes have introduced a layer of uncertainty, which the market typically dislikes. However, he outlined the other side of the argument, suggesting that this might be an effort to stimulate consumption, which has been an area of concern. ""While the capital gains tax has increased, the higher collections are being redirected to provide tax breaks in lower personal income tax slabs. This could be an attempt to revive consumption,"" Gupta explained.

A significant increase in the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on futures and options trades was also announced. Shankar Sharma, a renowned investor and market commentator, expressed strong dissatisfaction with the tax revisions. He criticized the increase in both long-term and short-term capital gains tax as unnecessary and poorly executed. ""I’m not happy. As simple as that,"" Sharma stated. He was particularly scathing about the increase in the long-term capital gains tax rate and the substantial rise in short-term gains tax. ""Although the rise from 10% to 12.5% looks small, it is a 25 percent rise in the long-term capital gains tax rate, and then there is a significant increase in short-term capital gains tax. It's a substantial increase,"" he said. Also Read | Will overseas funds see a revival after budget relief on capital gains tax? Sharma dismissed the government's attempt to alleviate the impact by raising the exemption limit from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1.25 lakh as insufficient. ""I mean, that's a palliative. That's like nothing at all,"" Sharma remarked. He also criticized the timing of these tax changes, pointing out that the equity market had already experienced lower-than-fixed-deposit returns in the past. ""Equity market investors had three good years, but prior to that, for 6-7 years, the market delivered risk-adjusted returns lower than fixed deposits,"" Sharma added. Sharma further emphasized the adverse effects of previous tax hikes on market performance. He recalled how the imposition of long-term capital gains tax in 2018 led to a sharp market downturn. ""In 2019, following the imposition of LTCG tax, India was the 18th worst-performing market globally. Europe was up 25 percent, the S&P 28 percent, the Nasdaq 35 percent, and most of Asia around 18-25 percent. India was up only 6-7 percent,"" Sharma said. ""So that is the effect that an imposition of taxation had on the stock market. So I hope it does not repeat."" Follow our live blog for all the market action Samir Arora, founder and fund manager of Helios Capital, shared similar concerns about the impact of the tax changes on post-tax returns. He expressed disappointment that the impact of the tax change is being downplayed by some fund managers and analysts. ""India has performed well on a pre-tax basis compared to other countries. However, the tax changes are likely to lead to a permanent reduction in post-tax returns."" He noted that while India has performed well relative to other markets in recent years, the tax increase could diminish future post-tax returns. ""I'm saying big picture, let us make India at least tax-neutral. Then everything else is in our favour and we are the biggest beneficiaries if the market does well.""

Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), however, saw modest gains of 2 percent. While there was no clear trigger for the steep rally, a potential factor behind this surge could be the notably low public float of these companies. For instance, the government holds an 85.4 percent stake in New India Assurance, with LIC and GIC-Re holding 1.3 percent and 8.7 percent, respectively, leaving only about 5 percent available for public trading. Similarly, the government holds an 85.8 percent stake in GIC-RE, with LIC holding 8.7 percent stake, leaving only about 5.5 percent available for public trading.

MFs see silver lining in tax hike: Higher tax could lead to longer holding periods for investors,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/mfs-see-silver-lining-in-tax-hike-higher-tax-could-lead-to-longer-holding-periods-for-investors-12779348.html,Market,"July 26, 2024 02:30 PM","While the stock market seems to be shrugging off the hike in capital gains tax on equities, mutual fund companies are hopeful that the increase in the long-term capital gains tax rate could actually result in investors adopting a longer-term view to minimize the tax impact. In an interview with Moneycontrol following the budget announcement, A Balasubramanian, MD & CEO of Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, noted that while the hike was not in line with market expectations, it could still have a positive impact on the mutual fund industry. “An increase in short-term capital gains tax by five percent might lead investors to hold their assets longer, which could be beneficial for the equity and mutual fund markets,"" he said. While presenting the Union Budget on July 23, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed increasing the tax on LTCG from 10 percent to 12.5 percent and the STCG from 15 percent to 20 percent. Edelweiss’ Trideep Bhattacharya said that for a two-year holding period, investors will see an impact of 1.25 percent per annum on the total returns; as the holding period is longer, the impact will continue to diminish. “Typically, investors should aim to hold their equity investments for 3 to 5 years. Considering a 5-year holding period, under the revised tax-rates, a 2.5 percent impact (12.5% versus 10%) over this time would result in ""lower returns"" by 50 basis points per annum. This 50 basis points per annum reduction is relatively minor and does not significantly influence investment decisions, as equity investors generally aim for double-digit returns from equity markets,” explains Bhattacharya. Karthik Kumar, Fund Manager at Axis Mutual Fund, said that while investor behavior might adjust somewhat to these changes, he added that taxes are typically one of many factors influencing investment decisions. ""The increased cost of short-term trading could lead some investors to hold investments longer, but this would be just one of several considerations,"" he said. He also noted that the increase in short-term capital gains tax to 20 percent seems intended to encourage longer-term investments by making short-term trading more costly. ""This measure aims to dissuade frequent market churning, thus impacting shorter-term retail trading strategies while incentivizing a longer-term investing culture,” he said. Besides, Kumar said, ""While the tax hike does slightly affect investors, it's not a game-changer, especially considering typical holding periods and market returns."" ITI AMC's Mayukh Datta concurs. ""Possibly, people will now invest for a longer period. This extra tax, which they have to pay, diminishes in impact if you hold the investment for a longer time,"" he explains, adding that the chances of achieving above-average returns are higher with a longer holding period. A fund manager who wished to remain unnamed agreed that this could add to the stickiness of investors but added that this was a rather ""optimistic view."" He said, ""It could make people think through whether the cost of moving to another fund is justified or if they should consider another product. We're not saying it will definitely happen, but it could encourage more long-term investment."" Overall, fund managers say that the tax changes do not impact the core strategies of mutual funds. ""The emphasis remains on encouraging longer-term investments, with 'long term' typically meaning a holding period of three to five years, depending on the strategy. The focus will remain on encouraging investors to stay through market cycles rather than timing the market or sectors,"" says Kumar. Indian mutual funds continued to see inflows across funds. Currently, there are about 8.99 crore (89.9 million) SIP accounts through which investors regularly invest in Indian mutual fund schemes. The total amount collected through SIP during June 2024 was Rs 21,262 crore, up from Rs 20,904 crore in May 2024 and Rs 20,371 crore in April 2024.

"Gold prices drop by Rs 5,000/10gm post Budget; bring cheers to retail investors",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gold-prices-drop-by-rs-500010gm-post-budget-bring-cheers-to-retail-investors-12779268.html,Market,"July 26, 2024 01:10 PM","Gold prices have corrected sharply by 7 per cent or Rs 5,000 per 10 grams in the local markets after the government slashed basic custom duty on gold, and the lower costs will encourage more people to invest in the yellow metal, both as a commodity and as a financial asset, experts say. Analysts said customs duty cut has made gold imports cheaper. The move will help curb the rampant issue of gold smuggling, leading to growth in the organised jewellery sector. ""The cut in basic custom duty on gold prices makes the yellow metal cheaper. While this can lead to weaker market sentiments due to the sudden change, retail investors stand to benefit from the new, more attractive pricing for gold,"" Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst of Commodity and Currency at LKP Securities told PTI. Echoing similar sentiments, Krishnan R-Director & CEO of Unimoni Financial Services said lower costs will encourage more people to invest in gold, both as a commodity and as a financial asset, which is often seen as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Following the Budget announcement by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman that the government has slashed basic customs duties on gold and silver from 15 per cent to 6 per cent, gold prices crashed by Rs 3,350 to Rs 72,300 per 10 grams in the national capital on Tuesday. The precious metal prices continued the downtrend and plunged by Rs 650 on Wednesday. The yellow metal rates saw another steep fall on Thursday, nosediving by Rs 1,000 to settle at Rs 70,650 per 10 grams, as per the All India Sarafa Association. After the duty cut, the yellow metal has declined Rs 5,000 per 10 grams or 7.1 per cent in the past three sessions, since July 23 when it had fallen Rs 3,350 to end at Rs 72,300 per kg. Also, gold of 99.5 per cent purity declined by Rs 1,000 to Rs 70,300 per 10 grams on Thursday. It had also lost ground by Rs 5,000 per 10 grams in the three previous sessions. On Thursday, silver rates also lost ground by Rs 3,500 per kg to Rs 84,000 per kg. In the past three sessions, the rates of the bright metal fell sharply by Rs 7,000 or 8.3 per cent to Rs 84,000 per kg from Rs 91,000 per kg. Traders also said that a sharp correction in gold prices have revived the demand for jewellery among consumers as they flocked to jewellery outlets to take advantage of lower prices. ""The reduction in basic custom duties have spurted the demand for jewellery in the domestic markets. Further, this will act as a sales booster for jewellers before the festive seasons, encouraging fresh buying by the consumers due to lower prices,"" PC Jeweller Managing Director Balram Garg told PTI. Low gold prices will help domestic jewellers, particularly the organised ones, Garg said. According to MP Ahammed, Chairman, Malabar Group, the reduction has been a long-standing demand of traders in the gold sector, as it is expected to curb the rampant issue of gold smuggling, which poses a substantial threat to the Indian economy. ""With the new rates, the duty on one kilogram of gold drops from Rs 9.82 lakh to Rs 3.93 lakh, making smuggling less attractive and more manageable. ""This move will help dismantle the mafia chain involved in smuggling, leading to growth in the organised jewellery sector and increasing government revenue through GST and income tax,"" Ahammed said. Meanwhile, in futures trade on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), gold futures have partially recovered after three days of slump on Friday. The most traded August contract jumped Rs 288 to Rs 67,750 per 10 grams on the MCX. It had settled at Rs 67,462 per 10 grams in the previous session on Thursday. However, silver contracts for September delivery continued its downward trend by declining Rs 241 to Rs 81,090 per kg. It had closed at Rs 81,331 per kg in the previous session on Thursday. As per the market experts, there will be stability in bullion prices once there is clarity on several economic and political factors such as interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve. ""Stability in gold prices is expected once there is clarity on several economic and political factors including, potential interest rate cuts in the US and India, and the outcome of the US Presidential elections will provide a clear direction for gold prices,"" Jateen Trivedi said.

Conversely, the Banking sector exerted downward pressure, with Nifty Bank ending 3.5 percent lower, and Metals seeing a 6.5 percent decline.

Nilesh Shah’s early warning signal to FM Sitharaman: Don't let gold become the next oil,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nilesh-shah-warning-signal-fm-sitharaman-watch-gold-12779229.html,Market,"July 26, 2024 04:17 PM","Kotak Mahindra AMC's Managing Director and CEO Nilesh Shah has urged Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to keep a watchful eye on any surge in India’s gold import bill in the wake of the customs duty cut and rising international prices. Shah made his submission to Sitharaman on 26 July at an exclusive Open House hosted by CNBC-TV18. ""One early warning signal Madam, we (India) are importing about 700 tonnes of gold, which is (worth) about $35-40 billion. With the reduction in gold import duty, gold imports will rise,” said Shah at the Open House, adding that he expects the price of gold to appreciate. The Union Budget 2024 has proposed to slash the import duty on gold, effectively halving the taxes. “It should not happen that our gold import bill starts exceeding our oil imports bill,” said Nilesh Shah. Also read: How Rs 10 lakh crore wealth in gold got destroyed in a single day Earlier this week, in Budget 2024, Finance Minister Sitharaman proposed to cut the basic customs duty on gold to 6 percent from 10 percent, and Agriculture Infrastructure & Development Cess (AIDC) to 1 percent from 5 percent. It will effectively reduce the overall taxes on gold to 9 percent (including GST) from around 18.5 percent. She also announced a reduction in customs duty on silver to 6 percent and that on platinum to 6.4 percent. India depends on imports to meet nearly 88 percent of its crude oil requirements. In the last financial year 2023-24, India’s net oil and gas imports (net of crude oil and petroleum products imports and exports) were at $121.6 billion. This was down from $144 billion a year ago. However, India’s dependence on imported crude oil rose to a new high of 87.7 percent in FY24, up from 87.4 percent in the previous year, showed the government data. India is also among the largest consumers of gold, depending on imports for nearly all of the yellow metal it purchases. While domestic gold prices saw a sharp fall on Budget day -- to Rs 69,269 per 10 grams on 23 July from Rs 72,875 a day before -- international prices are likely to continue to rise, say experts. Gold price are up nearly 15 percent so far this year. This rise in price, combined with the allure of the lower taxes, may prompt Indians to buy more gold, which Nilesh Shah sought to equate with oil imports. “The stress will be slow, but please keep a watch on the same,” he told the Finance Minister. Separately, on the government’s disinvestment programme, Nilesh Shah suggested Finance Minister Sitharaman to take up the low float PSUs first for stake sale. “Please give priority to the low-floating stock PSUs, where the valuation has gone on the higher side. If you supply, those prices will get corrected and there will be proper market discovery,” he said.

Well, that’s up for debate. And does being a man guarantee more success than being a woman? Ha! And surely, being younger beats being older, right? Rofl! Well, guess what? When it comes to intraday trading success, all these clichés get flipped upside down! The latest study from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) shows that things aren't as straightforward as they seem. Want to trade? Get married first! According to the study, married traders not only experience a lower proportion of losses but also generate a higher proportion of profits.  Besides, married traders engage in more trades compared to their single counterparts. In FY23, 75 percent of single traders were loss-makers, while the number of married loss-making traders was lower at 67 percent. In terms of profit, married traders were ahead. In FY23, the proportion of married profit-makers was 33 percent, while single profit-makers stood at 27 percent. Also, the average number of trades executed by married men was significantly higher at 86, compared to single men at 43. However, the number of married traders and single traders in FY23 was almost equal, at 28 lakhs and 27.4 lakhs, respectively. Young blood bleeds more There has been a sharp rise in participation by young traders in the intraday segment over the years. The proportion of individual traders under 30 years of age increased from 18 percent in FY19 to 48 percent in FY23. Participation by traders under 20 also increased from 0.2 percent in FY19 to 3.4 percent in FY23.  But in the world of trading, being young is no advantage; in fact, it’s quite the opposite. Individuals in the lower age group had a higher percentage of loss-makers compared to those in higher age groups.  Among individuals under 30 years old, 81 percent were loss-makers, while among those over 60, only 53 percent incurred losses in FY23. Meanwhile, 76 percent of traders in the 20-30 age group were loss-makers in FY23. Seems like youth might not be wasted on the young, but their money certainly is! Women make more profits Female traders had a lower proportion of loss-makers than male traders since FY19, according to the study. The proportion of female loss-making traders was 66 percent in FY23, while for male loss-making traders, this number was higher at 72 percent. Similarly, the proportion of women profit-traders was higher at 33 percent in FY23, compared to male profit traders at 28 percent.  However, the share of female traders declined to 16 percent in FY23 from 20 percent in FY19. Clearly, women aren’t just breaking the glass ceiling; they’re also cracking the trading code! Participation beyond cities The participation of individual traders from Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 cities has increased to 3x, 5x, and 10x in FY23 compared to FY19, the study revealed.  Interestingly, the proportion of loss-makers was lower in Tier 1 cities compared to Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. In FY23, the proportion of loss-makers in Tier 1 cities was 66 percent, while it was 68 percent and 70 percent in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, respectively. It seems like city dwellers have a bit of an edge—or maybe just better Wi-Fi! Other key findings of the study include:Around one in three individuals who trade in the equity cash segment trades intraday.The proportion of loss-makers increased to 80 percent for traders with very frequent (more than 500 trades in a year) trading activity. Maybe less is more?Seven out of ten individual intraday traders in the equity cash segment incurred net losses in FY23. Ouch! ",NEGATIVE

Capital gains tax structure changes will help IFSC,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/capital-gains-tax-structure-changes-will-help-ifsc-12779069.html,Market,"July 26, 2024 11:15 AM","The union budget’s proposals on capital gains tax structure has potentially a significant impact on foreign portfolio investors and the attractiveness of India’s international financial services centre (IFSC). The likely fallout are as follows. FPIs The proposals seek to increase the capital gains tax rates on listed equity shares from 10 percent to 12.5 percent and from 15 percent to 20 percent for long term capital gains and short term capital gains, respectively. The higher rates are applicable for all transfers of listed shares from today onwards. The increase in tax rates could potentially impact NAVs of offshore FPIs that provide for tax on accrued gains. IFSC IFSC is emerging as an important destination for Fund Managers to set up funds, especially to raise monies from offshore investors for investing in capital markets. Currently, there is a separate tax regime for Category III Alternative Investment Funds set up in IFSC which is broadly comparable to taxation regime for offshore Funds set up in jurisdictions such as Singapore and Mauritius. To provide further impetus to Funds in IFSC, it is proposed to extend the same regime to retail schemes and ETFs set up in IFSC (currently, there is no separate tax regime for such Funds in IFSC). With this announcement, Fund Managers may want to explore the setting up of retail schemes and ETFs in IFSC. The reduction in the long term capital gains tax rates from 20 percent to 12.5 percent and the period of holding to qualify as ""long term"" to twenty four months would help outbound Funds set up in IFSC which are raising monies from resident investors for investing outside India. Finance companies/global treasury centres set up in IFSC are eligible for a 10-year ""tax holiday"" (to be availed within 15 years from their date of registration with the IFSCA). There are ""thin capitalisation"" norms in the tax law that restrict the deduction of interest paid to 30 percent of EBIDTA. Domestic NBFCs were excluded from these norms. It is proposed to extend the benefit to finance companies (subject to conditions to be prescribed) set up in IFSC (relevant for non-""tax holiday"" period). This will encourage setting up of finance companies in IFSC for cross-border funding.

The Black Day for Gold: How Rs 10 lakh crore wealth got destroyed in a single day,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/the-black-day-for-gold-how-rs-10-lakh-crore-wealth-got-destroyed-in-a-single-day-12778810.html,Market,"July 27, 2024 06:59 PM","The pen is known to be mightier than the sword, and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proved it in one fell swoop. By announcing a cut in gold customs duty in the Union Budget 2024, gold prices tumbled over five percent, wiping off over Rs 10.7 lakh crore in value in a single day. When compared to the equity markets, this move caused the sixth-largest wealth erosion recorded so far. More importantly, the wealth destruction is likely to have hit far more households than the damage caused by the big falls in equities because the number of households owning gold is far higher in comparison. The fall in gold prices primarily impacts Indian households, which combined, own some of the largest reserves of gold across the world.  Currently, Indian households own approximately around 11 percent of the entire world's gold. This is more gold than large, developed nations like the US, Germany, Switzerland and the IMF combined. Why did gold prices fall on Budget Day? Since the year began, gold prices had been on a tearaway rally, jumping 14.7 percent and outperforming the Sensex, which has risen around 11 percent during the same time. Thus far in July, MCX gold has dropped by nearly 5.2 percent.  However, during the Budget, the Finance Minister announced a reduction on Basic Custom Duty on gold and silver from 10 percent to 6 percent and Agriculture Infrastructure & Development Cess (AIDC) from 5 percent to 1 percent. It will effectively reduce the overall taxes on gold from around 18.5 percent (including GST) to 9 percent.  Who does it impact and how? Gold traders were not happy with the move to reduce the value of the precious metal and began selling off their holdings, booking profits. Gold financiers were also none too pleased with the move, as it reduces the value of gold and will significantly reduce their loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, making them less financially secure. A lower LTV ratio means that the value of the gold used to secure loans is less compared to the total loans issued, thus reducing the companies' margin of safety. Even Indian households and temples, which combined own over 30,000 tonnes of gold, saw the value of their holdings sharply. However, the beneficiaries that will benefit from the move are organised jewellery players. The reduction in duty has been a long-standing demand of traders, as it will slow down smuggling as well. For the exchequer, lower smuggling is always positive. How this will impact the Centre’s revenues going ahead remains to be seen, as India is a net importer of gold. Some catalysts that could push gold prices back up are a weak dollar, festive time demand, US elections, geopolitical risk and Central Bank policy, noted Jigar Trivedi, senior commodities analyst, Reliance Securities.

Capital gains rationalisation is fine but there’s a reason for the backlash,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/capital-gains-rationalisation-is-fine-but-theres-a-reason-for-the-backlash-12778301.html,Market,"July 26, 2024 08:27 AM","By Sudhir Kapadia  The topic which has generated maximum heat and dust in Budget 2024 has been the capital gains tax proposals. To be sure, before every Budget over the years, there would be widespread discussion and debate on the need and nature of changes required to be made in respect of capital gains tax provisions. It is also obvious that there would be some level of asymmetry of thought amongst relevant stakeholders on any kind of changes attempted in the area of capital gains tax depending upon their individual interests. Undoubtedly, even much before the advent and subsequent scorching growth in investments in modern financial products like mutual funds, PMS, and AIFs, the provisions of capital gains taxation in India have been highly complex and contentious. Simultaneously, political parties, economists, professionals and academicians alike have periodically showered their wisdom on the ideal capital gains tax system for India and not infrequently, with inconsistent positions guided by expediency. In this heady mixture of proliferation of capital market products, robust growth in capital gains due to sustained high levels of stock market valuations and plethora of piecemeal tinkering of provisions over the years, any attempt to simplify and rationalise capital gains tax provisions must be applauded and supported. The background and design principle of the changes have been well explained in the Memorandum to Finance Bill 2024 and subsequent FAQs. So the question which needs focus and attention is simple - why has there been so much angst and backlash rather than applause for the attempt to rationalise and simplify the capital gains tax structure in Budget 2024? Anatomy of capital gains restructuring Firstly, there will be only two holding periods - 12 months and 24 months for determining whether the capital gains is short term or long term. For all listed securities, the holding period will be 12 months and for all other assets, it shall be 24 months. Thus, units of listed business trusts (REITs and InvITs) will now be at par with listed equity shares at 12 months instead of earlier 36 months. The holding period for bonds, debentures, and gold will reduce from 36 to 24 months. For unlisted shares and real estate it shall remain at 24 months. Secondly, the rate of short term capital gains on STT paid equity shares, units of equity oriented mutual funds and units of a business trust will increase from 15 percent to 20 percent ‘as the present rate is too low and the benefit from such low rate is flowing largely to high net worth individuals’. The rate of long-term capital gains will be 12.5 percent for all categories of assets. Thirdly, along with this reduced rate, benefit of indexation to calculate adjusted purchase price which is presently available for property, gold and other unlisted assets, will no longer be available. ‘This will ease computation of capital gains for the taxpayer and tax administration’.  Further, ‘for the benefit of lower and middle income classes’, the exemption limit of long term capital gains will be increased from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1.25 lakh. Where is the data? To begin with, the assertions made about the benefit of lower rate of 15 percent on short term capital gains flowing largely to high net worth individuals needs deeper scrutiny and analysis. There have been various data shared by market regulators and participants suggesting a broader and deeper proliferation of investors across the country beyond Tier 1 cities and increasingly encompassing middle class people. Thus, the foundational basis for the rate increase needs more empirical data, which if available with government authorities, should be shared in public domain to buttress this rationale. For the same reasons, a modest increase in exemption limit to Rs 1.25 lakh for long term capital gains seems unlikely to provide any material benefit to the middle classes as the frequency and growth in SIPs and investments in equity oriented mutual funds would suggest far greater number of investors falling way above the enhanced exemption limit. Indexation can’t be based on a template Next is the question of ‘retroactive’ application of the prospective removal of indexation benefit for assets like real estate albeit at the lower rate of 12.5 percent. Whilst Ministry of Finance officials have taken pains to clarify its impact, the fact of the matter is that these clarifications are purely theoretical in nature as the application of the new basis of taxation will significantly differ across myriad factual situations across the country. This is illustrated by the following typical example in a city like Mumbai:-  Thus, there is a steep increase of Rs 74 lakh for the taxpayer in the above scenario. Given the rapid pace of redevelopment of old properties in cities across India, it is not unusual for middle class home owners to monetise their older properties and create a safety retirement corpus with the liquid funds generation and these cases will be adversely impacted by the change in computation mechanism. Let us take another example of investment in debt oriented mutual funds (like PSU and Bank Debt Fund) subscribed in 2020/2021 during the pandemic years.  A typical example of this type of investment is given below:-  Since investments in debt oriented mutual funds made before 1st April 2023 were ‘grandfathered’ in Budget of 2023, many middle class investors who would be holding these kinds of debt mutual funds purchased earlier will now discover, to their dismay, that their returns are further diminished due to the additional tax outgo. An alternative approach It is eminently desirable to provide an option to taxpayers to calculate their long-term capital gains tax liability on real estate, gold and other unlisted​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ assets under either higher rate of 20 percent (with indexation) or lower rate of 12.5 percent (without indexation) rather than force a potentially more detrimental scheme (like in cases outlined above) on a taxpayer. The reason adduced for removing indexation benefit namely, ‘complexity in computation of capital gains’ seems rather tenuous as this computation mechanism has stood the test of time over the decades and there doesn't appear to be any serious disputes on the computation methodology. As per post budget clarifications, it appears that the incremental tax revenues on account of these capital gains tax changes are a relatively modest Rs 15,000 crores. Therefore, government should seriously consider restricting the changes to the laudable simplification in definition of holding period (12 and 24 months across all asset classes) without any need to increase either the short term or long term tax rates on listed securities. Under this scenario the higher rate of 20 percent (with indexation benefits) can be retained for gold, real estate and other unlisted assets. Government should consider a more comprehensive​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ feedback mechanism from all stakeholders and defer any changes in capital gains tax scheme till the larger simplification of the tax laws as announced by Finance Minister is undertaken.

"Hero Moto's appeal upheld, tax tribunal sets aside Rs 2,337 crore tax demand",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/hero-moto-itat-tax-demand-ruling-12778759.html,Market,"July 26, 2024 08:34 AM","Two-wheeler major Hero MotoCorp has got a favourable ruling from the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), setting aside an income tax demand of Rs 2,336.71 crore for AY12, the company informed stock exchange on July 25. The ITAT verdict upholds Hero Moto's appeal against the reassessment order and rules it invalid, rejecting the tax addition. The case pertains to Hero's JV with Honda, which was terminated in 2010, and Honda exited JV by selling its entire stake to the Hero Group, to enable both Hero Group and Honda to independently focus on two-wheeler business in India. The 26% stake held by Honda in HHML (JV) was to be taken over by Hero Group through Hero Investment Pvt. Ltd. In the appeal, the Hero Group said in an off-market deal in March 2011 acquired 5.19 crore equity shares, representing 26% stake in HHML, from Honda at Rs 739 per share, for a total Rs 3,841.83 crore being paid to Honda, on which due tax was paid. Hero MotoCorp has separately received tax demand notices amounting to nearly Rs 605 crore, inclusive of interest for Assessment Year (AY) 2013-14 to AY 2017-18 and FY19-20 from the income tax department.

Ford's stock plummets 18 due to warranty issues. Rupert Murdoch secretly manoeuvring to ensure his son Lachlan controls the family media empire. South Korea plans to lower inheritance taxes, easing financial pressures on billionaires. Jack Dorsey restructuring Block. All this and more on this edition of World Street. Search Wizardry OpenAI on Thursday announced a prototype of its search engine, called SearchGPT, which aims to give users “fast and timely answers with clear and relevant sources.” The company said it eventually plans to integrate the tool, which is currently being tested with a small group of users, into its ChatGPT chatbot. The rollout could have implications for Google and its dominant search engine. Warranty Woes Ford stock plunged 18.3 percent, marking its worst daily decline since 2008 and the second-worst performer of S&P 500 companies — after the company missed Wall Street’s bottom-line earnings expectations due to warranty problems, a recurring issue with the company. Succession Scramble Billionaire Rupert Murdoch, 93, is in a secret legal battle to secure Lachlan Murdoch’s control of the family’s media empire, according to the New York Times. Murdoch aims to change the family trust's terms, which would have given his other children, James, Elisabeth, and Prudence, a say in company decisions. Currently, the trust hands control to Murdoch’s four eldest children upon his death. However, sealed court documents reveal Murdoch wants Lachlan to have sole control over key assets, including Fox News, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post, the Australian, and the Sun and the Times in the UK. Heir Help South Korea is set to lower its inheritance tax ceiling from 50% to 40% and scrap additional payment requirements for owners, offering significant relief to billionaire families. For decades, firms like Samsung Electronics have faced up to 60% inheritance tax, forcing complex financial manoeuvres. President Yoon Suk Yeol's plan marks a contentious shift in policy, the Finance Ministry announced Thursday. Electric Edge US-listed Chinese electric car companies are now spending more on research as a percentage of sales than Tesla, according to a CNBC analysis of the four automakers’ first-quarter earnings. Many Chinese automakers already match or exceed their global peers in R&D spending as a percentage of revenue, a notable increase from previous years. This increased investment is a survival strategy in China’s highly competitive auto market, the largest in the world. Dorsey Shuffle Twitter (now X) founder Jack Dorsey is reorganizing Block, the fintech company behind Cash App, Square, and Tidal. In an internal memo to employees, Dorsey—Block’s CEO and cofounder—announced an overhaul of the internal reporting structure, breaking down the boundaries between business lines and grouping employees by roles like engineering, design, and sales. Lilly's Lament Eli Lilly & Co's market value dropped by over $120 billion, and its leading position in the weight-loss drug market is under threat due to promising developments from at least two competitors. The company’s shares fell 4.5 percent on Thursday, reaching their lowest level since May. New obesity drug updates from Viking Therapeutics and Roche Holding AG over the past week have triggered the selloff in Lilly’s shares. AI Armor Payments giant Visa is using artificial intelligence and machine learning to counter fraud. The company prevented $40 billion in fraudulent activity from October 2022 to September 2023, nearly double from a year ago, reported CNBC. In the last five years, the firm has invested $10 billion in technology that helps reduce fraud and increase network security.

However, the Finance Minister had other plans, and market fears became a reality when the government raised the capital gains tax. Experts now suggest that markets will likely adjust to the new taxes. They believe the hike is not too significant, and the transition will be smooth. With the budget behind us, Q1 earnings are now key factors in determining investor direction. For the auto industry, the Union Budget was expected to introduce new measures, especially given the push towards sustainability and the government's goal of net-zero emissions. At this pivotal juncture, industry stakeholders believed central government support was crucial for maintaining growth momentum. However, the lack of announcements regarding EVs, hybrids, and battery manufacturing could hamper progress. Federal Bank (Rs 204.67, +1.7%)Announced KVS Manian as new CEO, released Q1 results Bull case: Impressive revenue growth, stable asset quality. KVS Manian’s appointment as the new CEO ushers further optimism. Manian’s solid experience in banking (retail, commercial and corporate) along with non-banking financial service businesses a healthy fit in the areas where the lender has been looking to grow in recent years, KIE wrote. Bear case: Strong stock outperformance in recent months has taken it at par with IndusInd Bank, although with a lower return ratio, which could potentially cap returns, KIE believes. Hindustan Zinc (CMP: Rs 611, -3.34%) Govt considers divesting 3-5 percent stake Bull case: If the government stake sale goes through, the higher float would make Hindustan Zinc stock more attractive for large private investors. The stake sale would also pave the way for the long-pending demerger and restructuring of the company. Moreover, the company had guided for on-track capex progress as their fumer and alloy plants commenced commercial production in the prior fiscal. The company's net cash position is also higher at Rs 1,700 crore as compared to debt at Rs 400 crore, which bodes well for the stock's prospects. Bear case: Tepid demand in the European and Chinese economies can spill trouble to the Indian economy, spoiling metal production and Hindustan Zinc's stock outlook. The de-rating of the stock is also possible if there is a delay in the divestment process or it doesn't get through. Adani Green Energy (Rs 1,849, +7.75%) Consolidated net profit leaps 95 percent on-year to Rs 629 crore and total income increases 22.5 percent to Rs 3,122 crore in Q1FY25. Bull Case: Adani Green Energy's strong business model, with 25-year fixed-term PPAs, ensures predictable cash flow and stability. Despite high current valuations, analysts expect its robust growth trajectory to maintain these valuations over time. Bear Case: A sharp global economic slowdown, coupled with execution delays leading to cost overruns and high debt levels with increased borrowing costs, could severely strain Adani Green Energy's financial stability and impact revenue generation.

Oil edges up on strong US GDP data but Asia economic woes limit gains,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/oil-edges-up-on-strong-us-gdp-data-but-asia-economic-woes-limit-gains-12778729.html,Market,"July 26, 2024 06:33 AM","Oil prices were up slightly on Friday on stronger-than-expected U.S. economic data that raised investor expectations for increasing crude oil demand from the world's largest energy consumer. But concerns about soft economic conditions in Asia's biggest economies, China and Japan, capped gains. Brent crude futures for September rose 7 cents to $82.44 a barrel by 0014 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for September increased 4 cents to $78.32 per barrel. In the second quarter, the U.S. economy grew at a faster-than-expected annualised rate of 2.8% as consumers spent more and businesses increased investments, Commerce Department data showed. Economists polled by Reuters had predicted U.S. gross domestic product would grow by 2.0% over the period. At the same time, inflation pressures eased, which kept intact expectations that the Federal Reserve would move forward with a September interest rate cut. Lower interest rates tend to boost economic activity, which can spur oil demand. Still, continued signs of trouble in parts of Asia limited oil price gains. Core consumer prices in Japan's capital were up 2.2% in July from a year earlier, data showed on Friday, raising market expectations of an interest rate hike in the near term. But an index that strips away energy costs, seen as a better gauge of underlying price trends, rose at the slowest annual pace in nearly two years, suggesting that price hikes are moderating due to soft consumption. China, the world's biggest crude importer, surprised markets for a second time this week by conducting an unscheduled lending operation on Thursday at steeply lower rates, suggesting authorities are trying to provide heavier monetary stimulus to prop up the economy.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average hung onto early gains to close higher on stronger-than-expected U.S. gross domestic product data. Small-cap stocks also rose as investors sought out value away from the megacaps, with the Russell 2000 rising 1.3% to partially recoup some of Wednesday's losses. Megacap stocks recovered from a shaky start to trade higher at mid-afternoon but many slipped later, with Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Nvidia ending between 1.7% and 2.4% down. Alphabet's shares fell for a second straight day, dipping 3.1% to its lowest close since May 6, but Tesla rose. Lackluster earnings from the Google parent and the electric vehicle maker had pummeled the so-called Magnificent Seven group of tech stocks on Wednesday, prompting the Nasdaq and S&P 500 to log their worst day since 2022. The Cboe Volatility Index, known as Wall Street's fear gauge, extended its recent gains to close at 18.46, a fresh 14-week high. ""I think the market is kind of lurching,"" said Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment officer at BMO Wealth Management. ""The concern had been building and yesterday was a bit of a crescendo of that concern, but some of that has been alleviated today."" While investors are still trying to grapple with Wednesday's disappointing earnings reports, and political and economic uncertainty, Ma said ultimately recent data shows a resilient U.S. economy. Thursday's GDP report showed the U.S. economy expanded 2.8% in the second quarter versus an estimate of 2%. Inflation subsided, leaving expectations of a September Federal Reserve interest rate cut intact. All eyes are now on Friday's personal consumption expenditures price data to confirm bets of an early start to Fed rate cuts. While heavyweight stocks have powered the market to all-time highs this year, Wednesday's sell-off reinforced fears that these stocks might be over-stretched and are in for more turbulence. This concern has driven value investors, speeding up their rotation into smaller-cap stocks and other sectors outside megacap technology. The S&P Small Cap 600 rose 1.4% on Thursday. The S&P 500 lost 27.91 points, or 0.51%, at 5,399.22 points, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 160.69 points, or 0.93%, to 17,181.72. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 81.20 points, or 0.20%, to 39,935.07. Among earnings-driven moves, IBM shares jumped 4.3%, also boosting the blue-chip Dow, after the tech company beat estimates for second-quarter revenue and raised the annual growth forecast for its software business. American Airlines rose 4.2% after cutting its annual profit forecast. Southwest Airlines climbed 5.5% after saying it would implement changes including ending open seating and offering seats with extra legroom. Advances by airlines and logistics firms, with Old Dominion  up 5.7% and J B Hunt rising 4.3%, helped the Dow Jones Transportation Average  gain 1.3%. Ford  slumped 18.4% after the automaker's second-quarter adjusted profit missed estimates by a wide margin. Edwards Lifesciences  tumbled 31.3% after it missed second-quarter revenue estimates. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 13.23 billion shares, compared with the 11.60 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

"Trading Plan: Will Nifty 50 climb towards 24,600, Bank Nifty snap 3-day weakness on Friday?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trading-plan-will-nifty-50-climb-towards-24600-bank-nifty-snap-3-day-weakness-on-friday-12778682.html,Market,"July 25, 2024 11:58 PM","The Nifty 50 recovered almost all its opening losses and finished flat on July 25. Consistently holding 24,400, the index may march towards the 24,500-24,600 zone. If it fails to do so, 24,200 is the level to watch on the downside. The Bank Nifty may attempt to climb above the 51,000 mark, given the momentum indicator RSI is looking a bit oversold. However, in case of correction, it may take support at 50,500, and below that, it may break the 50,000 mark, according to experts. On Thursday, the Nifty 50 was down 7 points at 24,406, and the Bank Nifty dropped 428 points to 50,889. On the NSE, 1,213 shares declined, while 1,138 shares advanced. Nifty Outlook and Strategy Deven Mehata, Equity Research Analyst at Choice Broking The Nifty experienced a gap-down opening and traded volatile on its monthly expiry day. However, it closed at the day's high above the 24,400 level. On the downside, 24,200 serves as a robust support level. Given the current momentum, Nifty has the potential to approach the 24,650 level in the coming days. Investors should monitor these support and resistance levels closely for further market cues. The strong closing above the 24,400 level indicates underlying bullish sentiment, suggesting the possibility of continued upward movement in the near term. Key Resistance: 24,500, 24,650 Key Support: 24,300, 24,200 Strategy: Buy on dips near the 24,300 level for a target of 24,500 and 24,650 levels, with a stop-loss of 24,200 on a closing basis. Chandan Taparia, Head - Equity Derivatives & Technicals, Broking & Distribution at Motilal Oswal Financial Services The Nifty continued its losing streak for the fifth consecutive day but formed a bullish candle on the daily scale on Thursday as it closed higher than its opening zones. Now it has to hold above 24,200 for an up move towards the 24,700 zone while on the downside major support exists at 24,200 and 24,075 levels. India VIX corrected from 16 to 11.28 levels in the last three trading sessions but witnessed some recovery near the 12.50 zone. Overall lower volatility is ruling out any major panic and suggests that declines could be bought in the market. Key Resistance: 24,600, 24,750 Key Support: 24,200, 24,075 Strategy: Buy on decline with support of 24,200 for a target of 24,600 & 24,750 levels. Mitesh Karwa, Research Analyst at Bonanza Portfolio After opening with a big gap down, Nifty has finally taken support from the crucial support zone of 24,200 and closed near 24,400 on spot, signaling that buyers are dominating at lower price levels. The EMAs (20, 50, 100, 200) are also indicating bullish strength, which is a positive sign. Overall, the market appears to be moving in a positive direction and looks favourable, though short-term negativity cannot be ruled out. Key Resistance: 24,450, 24,600 Key Support: 24,150, 24,350 Strategy: Buy near 24,350 with a stop-loss of 24,290 for a target of 24,450. Bank Nifty - Outlook and Positioning Deven Mehata, Equity Research Analyst at Choice Broking Bank Nifty has traded sideways after a gap-down opening. On the lower side, it has strong support near the 50,500 level. On the higher side, it has resistance near the 51,000 level, which is also close to its 50-day EMA level. Once Bank Nifty sustains above the mentioned level of 51,000, we can witness a strong up move in the index towards the 51,800 level. The overall chart structure looks bearish, but the index has support at the mentioned levels. We can witness further correction if Bank Nifty closes below the mentioned support levels. Traders are advised to trade with a strict stop-loss and should book quick profits. Key Resistance: 51,600, 51,800 Key Support: 50,600, 50,500 Strategy: Buy on dips near the 50,600 level for a target of 51,600 level, with a stop-loss of 50,500 on a closing basis. Chandan Taparia, Head - Equity Derivatives & Technicals, Broking & Distribution at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Bank Nifty corrected by around 2,800 points from its high of 53,357 to 50,559 levels. It has recently given a breakdown from its trading range of 51,750 to 52,800 zones and is trading below its 50 DEMA. Now till it holds below the 51,250 level, the overall upside could be capped for a decline towards the 50,500 and 50,250 levels, while the hurdle is placed at the 51,250 and 51,500 levels on the higher side. Key Resistance: 51,250, 51,500 Key Support: 50,500, 50,250 Strategy: Sell on bounce with a hurdle of 51,500, for the downside target towards the 50,250 level. Mitesh Karwa, Research Analyst at Bonanza Portfolio Bank Nifty should remain in a sideways to bullish trend in the coming week. The index has seen heavy correction in the last 15 days and may halt for a couple of days before deciding the new short-term trend. Overall, the short-term correction in the index from the top is expected to halt. For Bank Nifty to continue its upward trend, the price needs to sustain above 50,500. Key Resistance: 51,500, 52.000 Key Support: 50,000, 50,500 Strategy: Buy on dips till 50,500, for a target of 51,500.

The momentum indicator RSI at 40 seems to be looking oversold now.  3) Nifty Call Options Data According to the monthly options data, the 24,400 strike holds the maximum open interest (with 2.2 crore contracts).

The increasing PCR, or being higher than 0.7 or surpassing 1, means traders are selling more Put options than Call options, which generally indicates the firming up of a bullish sentiment in the market. If the ratio falls below 0.7 or moves towards 0.5, then it indicates selling in Calls is higher than selling in Puts, reflecting a bearish mood in the market.  9) India VIX The volatility rebounded after a sharp fall in the previous couple of sessions but remained below all key moving averages on a closing basis.

Tech Mahindra's telecom sector sees glimmer of hope as declines narrow,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/tech-mahindras-telecom-sector-sees-glimmer-of-hope-as-declines-narrow-12778497.html,Market,"July 25, 2024 10:46 PM","Tech Mahindra expects a year-on-year improvement in its telecom business, despite recent challenges, Mohit Joshi, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of Tech Mahindra said in a post-earnings conference call. For FY24, the company reported a 12.4 percent decline in its telecom sector revenue, with a steeper drop of 16.5 percent in Q4 FY24, Joshi said. However, there's a silver lining on the horizon with Q1 FY25 figures showing that the declines have now reduced to single digits. ""I expect to see some level of year-on-year improvement in the telecom business over time. I believe that our sort of position in telecom from a comparative position remains very strong,"" Joshi said. Joshi said that despite the ongoing challenges and visible spending pressures within the telecom sector, Tech Mahindra, as a major industry player, stands to gain as the sector recovers. While he doesn't expect immediate improvements, he believes that, given the sector's size, a positive trend will emerge over time. Also Read | Tech Mahindra adds 2,165 employees in Q1FY25 The communication vertical's performance fell nearly 2 percent QoQ and nearly 10 percent on an annual basis, according to the press release shared by Tech Mahindra. Communications, Media, and Entertainment (CME) accounts for nearly 40 percent of the company's revenue which includes telecom as well. Telecommunication is a key differentiator for Tech Mahindra which serves seven of the top ten operators. ""If I look at the priority that operators have, these are broadly in three areas,"" Joshi said and went on to highlight cost management, revenue generation, and AI integration as the three areas. ""Whether it's a vendor consolidation or it is autonomous operations and autonomous networks, we are active in that space,"" Joshi said regarding the cost side. ""The second is revenue generation, both on the B2B and B2C side, and the wholesale network side."" Also Read | Tech Mahindra Q1 earnings preview: Analysts forecast 30% profit boost, marginal revenue increase ""And finally, working with our clients to help them become AI-native telcos,"" Joshi added. Tech Mahindra reported its Q1 FY25 earnings on July 25 wherein the company's consolidated net profit rose nearly 29 percent QoQ to Rs 851 crore, on low base effect. Revenue from operations rose 1 percent to Rs 13,005 crore. Both net profit and revenue came in slightly below Moneycontrol's estimates of Rs 861 crore and Rs 12,968 crore. Meanwhile, the company's EBIT margin expanded by 110 basis points to 8.5 percent on a QoQ basis, surpassing Moneycontrol's estimate of 8 percent. The company attributed the increase in EBIT margin to cost-saving measures under Project Fortius and operational efficiencies.

"Ramco Cements Q1 Preview: Weak prices, realisations, stiff competition pour concrete on profit hopes",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/ramco-cements-q1-preview-weak-prices-realisations-stiff-competition-pour-concrete-on-profit-hopes-12778609.html,Market,"July 25, 2024 09:11 PM","Ramco Cements is set to present its earnings report for the first fiscal quarter of FY25 on July 26. The cement manufacturer is expected to deliver a subpar performance in Q1FY25 with net profit and revenue declining, primarily due to weaker cement prices because of increase in intense competition and higher regional concentration lately. According to a Moneycontrol poll, Ramco Cements' net profit is expected to slump 51 percent on-year to Rs 38 crore. Revenue is seen falling around 1.3 percent YoY to Rs 2,221 crore. Even the most optimistic estimate sees Ramco Cements' net profit falling 31 percent on-year. The most pessimistic projection suggests that net profit might sink nearly 69 percent YoY.  On a sequential basis, net profit and revenue are seen falling 68 percent, and 17 percent, respectively. Also Read | DLF's net profit jumps 22.5% to Rs 646 crore in Q1FY25, revenue down 4% What factors are driving the earnings? Weak demand: The slowdown in construction activities during the general elections in April and May adversely impacted cement sales in these months. Scorching heat, labour shortages, and unseasonal rain in some regions further dented demand during Q1FY25. Muted prices: Cement prices entered Q1FY25 with a steep hike announcement in some regions, but with lower-than-historical average demand and a sudden ramp-up of M&As among large players, sustaining any price hike became impossible. Hikes implemented in April were reversed during May and June due to soft demand and stiff competition. Decline in realisations: According to analysts at Motilal Oswal, price realization is likely to decline around eight percent YoY due to weak pricing in the southern region. Price realisation in cement refers to the average revenue a company earns per unit sold. It helps gauge the average income per ton, with higher realisation indicating better profitability per unit. High Costs: The cement maker's depreciation/interest expenses are estimated to increase by 14 percent and 12 percent on-year, respectively, according to Motilal Oswal. What to look out for in the quarterly show? Analysts will closely monitor Ramco Cements' management commentary on demand conditions during this seasonally weak quarter, price sustainability amid intensifying competition, and ongoing sector consolidation.

"Cisco launches AI firewall featuring self-writing, self-testing code",https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/cisco-launches-ai-firewall-featuring-self-writing-self-testing-code-article-12778408.html,Market,"July 25, 2024 05:11 PM","Enterprise networking and security firm Cisco on July 25 said its firewall is now AI-driven, which autonomously manages and updates itself, aimed at simplifying cyber-defence for its enterprise clients. The new firewall is designed to write its own codes, test them in real-time within the user's environment, and deploy them across different platforms, whether in data centers, the cloud, or a combination of both. The AI-powered firewall can also automatically remove rules once it deems unnecessary. “We've built a firewall now that writes its own rules, tests the rules in your environment, live with traffic, deploys these rules wherever the application is at, whether in your data center, cloud, or a combination thereof. When the rule is no longer needed, it takes out the rule,” said Raj Chopra, Chief Product Officer-Security Business Group, Cisco. This new feature comes at a time when enterprises face increasing cyber-attacks around the world. According to reports, the global cost of cybercrime is estimated to be over a whopping $8 trillion in 2023. Nonetheless, the AI-driven approach reduces manual oversight and comes with a feature to function without requiring manual upgrades. This is equivalent to a user experience by modern web browsers like Chrome, Safari, Edge, and Firefox, which updates automatically in the background. “You never have to upgrade ever again,” Chopra said while delivering a keynote address at the Accel Cybersecurity Summit 2024. “I don’t even know what version of Chrome I’m using. And I spend half my waking day in Chrome. I don’t even care what version it is,” Chopra further commented. Cisco’s move to integrate AI into its cybersecurity solutions reflects a broader trend in the technology industry, where automation and intelligent systems are being increasingly used. Cisco's Global Traffic Cisco claims that 80 percent of the world's internet traffic runs on systems that have been built by it. ""So if any system is connected to something else, Cisco has a role to play in that. (About) 80 percent of the world's traffic runs through something that is Cisco,” Chopra said. This near-monopoly in connectivity allows Cisco to “harness” and utilise vast amounts of data for contextual insights. The company said this happens in three phases: assistantship, augmentation, and automation. The first phase, assistantship, is already under playing out with AI functioning as an assistant, answering questions and providing guidance. “We have built this capability in a lot of our interactions in the console,” Chopra said. The second phase – augmentation - sees AI not just informing but augmenting workflows. This is particularly beneficial in high-stress environments like Security Operations Centers (SOCs), where AI assists professionals by augmenting their actions rather than replacing them. “So how can you augment a professional, not replacement, but augment the actions that they're trying to do? This is what we're working on next,” he added. The third phase, automation, builds on the trust established in the previous phases. Chopra warned that automation can make a good thing happen really fast, but it can also make a bad thing happen faster. “All of them are happening at the same time for different use cases. But it's a broad effort within Cisco,” Chopra added. Meanwhile, Cisco has been doubling down in India, launching its cloud-based Webex Calling for enterprises in partnership with Tata Communications in May.

Are water stocks set to make the next big splash?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/are-water-stocks-set-to-make-the-next-big-splash-12778361.html,Market,"July 25, 2024 04:38 PM","Infrastructure as a broad segment was always high on the market radar but now it appears that water treatment & distribution segment within the infrastructure space is fast emerging as a hot favourite following some of the announcements made in the Union Budget. Stocks like Va Tech Wabag, Ion Exchange, Welspun Enterprises, WPIL and EMS Limited are suddenly being talked about in the analyst and investor community and have also been gaining steady ground in an otherwise weak market. While presenting the budget on July 23, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the Centre will be working in partnership with the state governments and Multilateral Development Banks to promote water supply, sewage treatment and solid waste management projects and services for 100 large cities through bankable projects. More importantly, the Finance Minister announced a budgetary allocation of Rs 69,926.65 crore for the Jal Jeevan Mission, up from around Rs 69,846.31 crore in 2023-2024. This is the government's flagship mission that aims to provide “functional water connections” to every rural household. Further, the Department of Sanitation and Water Treatment has received a budgetary allocation of Rs 77,390 crore against Rs 77,032.65 crore in the previous budget (FY23-24). Also read: Why this water treatment stock merits attention, post Budget “This sector continues to remain under focus as it addresses the basic need for water availability, which the government needs to fulfil,” notes SBI Cap Securities' Sunny Agrawal in a latest report, adding that the schemes will continue to be a priority for the next 3-4 years, as the agenda is still a work in progress. Analysts further believe that the investment opportunity in India's water and wastewater sector is substantial, with an estimated market size of approximately Rs 25,000-30,000 crore per annum, split roughly 40:60 between water and wastewater. “Currently, only about 40 percent of sewage is treated, and many cities lack adequate sewerage networks and water supply. India still has a long way to go in enhancing its water infrastructure,” says Arvind Kothari, smallcase Manager & Founder of Niveshaay. The market is expected to grow by 12-15 percent over the next 4-5 years, according to research done by Niveshaay Investment Advisory. They expect to see investments of around Rs 50,000-60,000 crore in the space through government schemes over the next three years. “Many companies and sectors will benefit, including those involved in pipe structures, structural tube pipes, and large and small diameter pipes as well as water treatment companies. These companies have strong order books in water treatment or sewage treatment,” says Agrawal. Here are some of the key players in the segment to keep watch out for. Ion Exchange (CMP: Rs 674.75): The Mumbai-based company provides solutions for water, wastewater treatment, solid waste management and waste to energy. They offer products and services, including ion exchange resins, water treatment chemicals, and turnkey project execution with industrial, institutional, and municipal clients. The stock has gained around 266.7 percent over the last five years. Va Tech Wabag (CMP: Rs 1,378): Va Tech Wabag is India’s largest and the world’s third largest water treatment multinational. It specialises in water treatment solutions, offering a range of services including design, construction, and maintenance of water and wastewater treatment plants. The stock has gained around 337 percent over the last five years. Welspun Enterprises (CMP: Rs 512.4): Welspun Enterprises is a part of the Welspun Group and focuses on infrastructure development with projects such as road construction, water supply, and sanitation. The stock has gained around 365.79 percent over the last five years. WPIL (CMP: Rs 471.5):  WPIL Limited specialises in pumps and pumping systems. It serves a variety of sectors, including water supply, irrigation, power, and oil & gas. EMS limited (CMP: Rs 770.2): EMS is a multi-disciplinary EPC company which specialises in providing turnkey services in water and wastewater collection, treatment and disposal. Over the last five years, the stock has gained 510.13 percent. Vishnu Prakash R Punglia (CMP: Rs 225.4) : Vishnu Prakash is an integrated infrastructure company with its principal business operations in the field of water supply, railways, roadways and irrigation networks.  Valuations Regarding valuations in this segment, they are not very expensive, though slightly higher compared to other construction sectors due to strong profit and revenue growth visibility, Agrawal notes. Abhinav Kapadia, Research Analyst- Institutional Equities at Asit C. Mehta Investment Interrmediates concurs, “The sector has seen a significant rally. Valuations are a bit stretched at this point of time. Having said that, if growth is higher than our expectations, companies may see an up move.” Currently analysts do not see many headwinds for the sector except for slow execution. “In the past, several significant water projects have stalled due to delays in receiving payments from government authorities. However, this issue has been largely addressed for projects funded by multilateral agencies such as the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank,” says Kothari.

However, the Bank Nifty maintained its underperformance. The Nifty index also managed to defend the 20-day SMA (Simple Moving Average 24,373) for the third straight session, which is also the middle of the Bollinger band. Experts noted that if the index decisively closes below the 24,400 level, a downmove towards 24,100-24,000 can't be ruled out. Conversely, if it defends the 24,400 level, then the 24,500-24,600 zone is worth watching. The Nifty 50 opened sharply lower at 24,231 and hit an intraday low of 24,211 in early trade. However, it immediately started recouping those losses as the day progressed and finally finished at 24,406, down 7 points. The index recovered nearly 200 points from the day's low and formed a bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts. ""We believe that the index is undergoing a counter trend pullback which can extend towards 24,500 – 24,550, which coincides with the 61.82 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the fall,"" said Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. The daily momentum indicator has a negative crossover, suggesting this rally is likely to fizzle out. Ideally, this rally should be sold into, he advised. The options data indicated that 24,400 is expected to be a crucial level for market direction, with support at 24,000 and resistance at 24,800. According to the monthly options data, the maximum Call open interest was seen at the 24,400 strike, followed by the 24,800 and 24,500 strikes, with maximum Call writing at the 24,400 strike, and then the 24,500 and 24,800 strikes. On the Put side, the 24,400 strike holds the maximum open interest, followed by the 24,300 and 24,000 strikes, with maximum writing at the 24,400 strike, and then the 24,300 and 24,200 strikes. Bank Nifty The Bank Nifty continued to underperform the benchmark Nifty 50, falling 428 points or 0.83 percent to 50,889 on the first day of the August series. The index extended its downtrend for the third consecutive session with a lower high-lower low formation and closed below the 50-day EMA (50,940), forming a bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts as the closing was higher than the opening level. ""Now, until the index holds below the 51,250 zone, some weakness could be seen towards the 50,500 then 50,250 levels, whereas on the upside, a hurdle is seen at 51,250 then 51,500 zones,"" said Chandan Taparia, Senior Vice President | Analyst-Derivatives at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

In an interview with Moneycontrol, Mishra praised the budget's allocation for these states as an essential step for national development. While the central government's ability to favour certain states is now restricted, it can still influence national infrastructure projects.

Gold loan stocks to feel the pinch from duty cut as margin of safety shrinks: Analysts,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gold-loan-stocks-to-feel-the-pinch-from-duty-cut-as-margin-of-safety-shrinks-analysts-12778320.html,Market,"July 25, 2024 03:43 PM","While jewellery stocks danced on reduced customs duty on gold to 6 percent from 15 percent, but shares of top gold loan issuers Manappuram Finance, Muthoot Finance - took a hit, plunging over 5 percent each after the Budget announcement. Analysts believe that this reduction in gold duties could lead to lower gold prices, which could negatively impact gold loan companies in the near term by diminishing their financial cushion or 'margin of safety.' Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities explained that if gold prices start to decline, gold financing companies might experience a reduction in their loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, making them less financially secure. A lower LTV ratio means that the value of the gold used to secure loans is less compared to the total loans issued, thus reducing the companies' margin of safety. ALSO READ: Mild overweight on equities; bullish on Indian government bonds: the post-Budget view Jasani also highlighted that fewer people and businesses might take out new loans backed by gold since the value of the gold collateral would be lower. He advised investors to consider taking profits from related stocks given these potential impacts. Analysts at InCred Equities shared similar concerns, noting that a decline in gold prices could lead to irregular repayments by borrowers if the value of their gold collateral falls below the loan amount. Despite these concerns about LTV ratios, analysts at SBI Funds Management believe that gold financiers will navigate these challenges effectively in the medium term. They noted that the LTV ratios for gold financiers are in the low 60s and do not expect significant asset quality issues. Muthoot, Manappuram Finance glitters on rising gold prices Over the past five years, rising gold prices have significantly benefited Muthoot Finance and Manappuram Finance. Gold prices have nearly doubled to Rs 68,918 per 10 gram from Rs 34,943 per 10 gram, leading to increased lending by gold financiers and boosting gold loan assets under management (AUM) in recent quarters. Muthoot Finance's gold loans grew at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16 percent in 5 years, driven largely by a 14 percent CAGR in gold prices. In contrast, Manappuram Finance's gold loan portfolio expanded at modest 11 percent CAGR during the same period. ALSO READ: 21 Budget stocks that may benefit from FM Nirmala Sitharaman's announcements As gold loans account for 96 percent of Muthoot Finance's standalone assets under management (AUM), compared to 51 percent of Manappuram Finance's consolidated AUM, it indicates that Muthoot Finance's loan book is more heavily reliant on gold price fluctuations. In contrast, Manappuram Finance's AUM is more diversified, including micro-financial institutions (26 percent of AUM), vehicle loans (10 percent of AUM), and home loans (4 percent of AUM) in addition to gold financing. The way ahead Looking ahead, market participants will closely monitor gold's performance in dollar terms, as it will influence local gold prices. Independent market expert Ambareesh Baliga believes that the recent fall in gold prices due to the government’s move is already reflected in the market, and future trends will be driven by other market forces. Similarly, Gaurang Shah, Senior Vice-President at Geojit Financial Services, expects that the festive season and monsoon activity will impact gold prices and, consequently, the performance of gold financiers. Shah noted that, as global gold prices have not decreased significantly, a rebound in domestic gold prices is anticipated now that the domestic event is out of the way.

"MC Exclusive : Be extra cautious while approving SME IPOs, Sebi tells exchanges",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/be-extra-cautious-while-approving-sme-ipos-sebi-tells-exchanges-12778228.html,Market,"July 25, 2024 03:09 PM","As part of its attempts to address the concerns around the SME IPO segment, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has directed the stock exchanges to be extra cautious while approving the documents for initial public offers of small and medium enterprises. According to persons familiar with the development, the capital market watchdog has told the bourses to enhance the level of due diligence done while vetting these documents even if it leads to a slowdown in terms of the pace of approvals for SME IPOs. “The exchanges are now asking additional questions related to objects of the issue and capex plans, among other things,” said an investment banker who has managed a few SME IPOs. “The last couple of months have even the quantum of correspondence between the exchanges and bankers managing SME IPOs increasing manifold to seek clarity on various disclosures made in the IPO document,” he added wishing not to be named. This assumes significance as the Sebi directive comes close on the heels of concerns raised by none other than the Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch. In March, Buch had said that the capital market watchdog has observed signs of manipulation in trading and issuance in the SME space. She had further said that Sebi is working on to introduce additional disclosures in the SME space. “We do see signs of manipulation in the SME (small and medium enterprises) segment… We are able to see certain patterns. However, as per our regulation, the way that we need to construct the entire case, we do need to take some time to do that in a robust manner,” Buch had said in March. Incidentally, the regulator is already working on strengthening the eligibility criteria for the segment to ensure that fundamentally strong companies enter the market through the SME platform, which was launched in 2012. Also read: A Budget proposal that could help Sebi address SME IPO concerns “One of the things that Sebi is exploring is allowing only cash flow positive companies to apply for raising money via the SME route,” said a banker in the SME IPO segment. Currently, any SME making an operating profit in two out of the three years preceding to the IPO document filing is eligible for listing in the SME space. Another investment banker who has been managing SME IPOs for many years said that while earlier most of the queries were around the pricing and valuation, now questions are asked about working capital, loan repayment, and disclosures around business model. “The exchanges are now questioning the necessity of raising public funds for loan repayments. They, at times, ask if the interest rate the company is paying on its loans is equal to or less than the industry average,"" said the banker. The latest move, however, is another step towards the joint efforts of the regulator and the exchanges to address concerns related to the unusually high level of subscription and listing premiums that have become the norm in the segment. In July, the National Stock Exchange (NSE) said it will place an overall cap of 90 percent over the issue price for SME IPOs during special pre-open session. The frenzy in the SME IPO segment, however, has continued unabated amidst all the regulatory monitoring. Recently, the SME IPO of HOAC Foods was subscribed 2013 times. The public issues of Kayce Energy & Infra and Medicamen Organics was subscribed 1,052 times and 993 times, respectively. Further, 49 SME IPOs have filed their draft documents with the exchanges since June, as per data from Prime Database. In the current calendar year till June, as many as 117 SME IPOs have hit the markets with the cumulative fund raising pegged at Rs 3,644 crore. Emails sent to BSE, NSE, and Sebi remained unanswered till the time of filing this story. Moneycontrol will update the story once they respond.

"Rollback of LTCG, STCG hike unlikely; modifications for pre-2012 homebuyers possible if...: Neelkanth Mishra",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/rollback-of-ltcg-stcg-hike-unlikely-modifications-for-pre-2012-homebuyers-possible-if-neelkanth-mishra-12777642.html,Market,"July 25, 2024 02:18 PM","With respect to real estate, rolling back the capital gains tax changes seems unlikely, although there may be some modifications or grandfathering provisions for specific groups, particularly those who bought real estate between 2001 and 2012, Neelkanth Mishra, Chief Economist at Axis Bank, told Moneycontrol. The budget 2024 announced the removal of indexation benefit available on sale of property and reduced the rate from 20% to 12.5%. Indexation adjusts the cost of assets for inflation to calculate capital gains more fairly. Without indexation, capital gains are simply the difference between the sale price and purchase price. For long-held assets like property, this can lead to disproportionately high gains. The government clarified that properties purchased before 2001 will retain indexation benefits for tax purposes, using either the 2001 price or the indexed price up to 2001, whichever is lower. Properties bought after 2001 will be taxed at a flat rate of 12.5 percent without indexation. Follow our live blog for all the market action For example, a Delhi house bought in 2001 for Rs 80 lakh and now worth Rs 12 crore would show a capital gain of Rs 11.2 crore without indexation. With indexation, the acquisition cost adjusts to Rs 2.9 crore, reducing the capital gain to Rs 9.1 crore. Mishra said that for real estate purchased after 2001, the removal of indexation benefits means early investors may face larger capital gains taxes if they sell now. ""While there is no denying that it is a concern, the reduced number of sales could actually benefit the real estate market. With fewer sellers and steady demand from buyers, this could create upward pressure on prices,"" Mishra said. He said, ""The likelihood of rolling it back seems very low. If there is a severe concern about certain brackets of homebuyers -- people who bought between 2001 and 2012 which was a period of high inflation -- maybe some modifications possibly can be considered.” Mishra qualified that adding, “I have no idea how the government thinks about these things. But a rollback seems very unlikely."" Also Read | MC Exclusive: Political limits to central government capital spends; capex to grow at nominal GDP growth: Neelkanth Mishra Although it's unfortunate for those facing higher taxes on older properties, the overall market outlook might not be severely impacted, said Mishra. Despite concerns about reduced inflation indexation making real estate less attractive, Mishra does not foresee a significant decline in its appeal. Real estate performance is more influenced by market cycles than by tax rate adjustments. Given that the rationalisation of tax rates has been a topic since the 2023 budget and has been continuously highlighted by senior finance ministry officials, including discussions following the 2024 vote, it's unlikely that a complete rollback will occur, Mishra said. He added that for those buying real estate for residential purpose (as opposed to investing), these tax changes won’t mean much. Also Read | Capital gains tax hike won't significantly deter investors, especially FIIs, says Neelkanth Mishra The changes announced under the Union Budget on the capital gains would be effective starting July 23. This means that even if an advance has been paid prior to the announcement, but the agreement hasn't yet been signed, then the loss on indexation would be applicable. Mishra said that real estate has underperformed over the last decade, with only a recent upswing in the past 2-3 years following Covid. This, Mishra said, suggests that the real estate market is still in the early stages of recovery.

According to Bloomberg estimates, Power Grid is expected to report around 8.4 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase in revenue at Rs 11,978 crore in Q1FY25 over Rs 11,048.1 crore in Q1FY24. Net profit is also expected to grow to Rs 4,028.2 crore in the quarter ending June 2024 compared to Rs 3,382.8 crore in the quarter ending June 2023. Currently, around 13 brokerages have buy calls on the stock and eight have sell calls. PGCIL is a central public sector undertaking (CPSU) under the ministry of power dealing in power transmission as well as telecom and consultancy. The stock has gained around 183 percent over the last five years and around 78.9 percent over the last one year. What are the factors impacting the earnings? Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities expect the company to report a modest revenue growth (7.7 percent YoY) due to asset capitalisation of Rs 7,600 crore in the trailing 12 months, while they expect them to report a healthy growth in PAT (11 percent YoY). EBITDA margin is expected to grow 2 basis points YoY from 87 percent in June 2023 to 87.2 percent in June 2024. Here are some of the factors that analysts expect will impact the earnings. Growth in capex – The company has set a capex target of Rs 15,000 crore in FY25, 20 percent higher than the FY24 capex of Rs 12,500 crore, say Elara Capital analysts. Capitalisation is likely to double in the range of Rs 1,50,000 – 1,60,000 crore in FY25. Power demand - Power generation across the sector grew 11 percent YoY growth to 490BU in Q1FY25 due to severe heatwaves with peak demand at 250GW in May, up 13 percent YoY, say broking firms. Growth of telecom and consultancy segment: Analysts see improved PAT as a result of increased contributions from the telecom and consultancy segment. In Q4, the telecom segment saw 11.8 percent YoY increase in revenue contribution to Rs 2,49,700 crore from Rs  2,08,800 crore in Q4FY23. Sustained growth in projects: Analysts at Elara Securities note that the quantum of work-in-hand projects rose to Rs 86,700 crore that includes ongoing regulated projects worth Rs 11,200 crore, new regulated projects at Rs 24,700 crore and other projects at Rs 508 crore. What to look for in the results?Analysts will be watching out on continued growth in capex and order realisations. Absence of new order or reduced orders due to challenges from the tariff-based competitive bidding route could be a concern. In Q4, the company, according to a May 2024 JM Financial report, had highlighted an estimated Rs 17,000 crore outlay in other businesses such as solar generation, smart metering and data center over the next 7-8 years. With continued government push for these segments, analysts will be awaiting announcements on the same.

Shriram Finance is expected to report a 17.3 percent increase in net profit at Rs 2,000 crore in Q1FY25 on a year-on-year (YoY) basis, as per mean estimates by Bloomberg. Net revenue, however, is likely to fall 37.3 percent to Rs 5,000 crore in the June quarter. What are the factors impacting the earnings?

Dr Reddy's Labs Q1 Preview: Tepid US sales likely to put brakes on earnings growth,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/dr-reddys-labs-q1-preview-tepid-us-sales-likely-to-put-brakes-on-earnings-growth-12777670.html,Market,"July 25, 2024 01:41 PM","Pharmaceutical major Dr Reddy's Laboratories is slated to release its results for the April-June quarter of FY25 on July 27. Largely flattish sales in the US amid rising competition in key drugs, combined with increased research and development spends are expected to weigh on the drugmaker's net profit in Q1. According to a Moneycontrol poll of eleven brokerages, Dr Reddy's Laboratories' revenue is estimated to grow 7.5 percent to Rs 7,242 crore in Q1 of FY25, compared to Rs 6,738 crore recorded in the same quarter of the previous fiscal. Net profit is predicted to fall 3.6 percent to Rs 1,351 crore, down from Rs 1,402 crore in the year-ago period.  There's significant contrast when it comes to brokerages' expectations regarding Dr Reddy's Q1 earnings performance. The most optimistic forecasts predict around 16 percent profit growth, while the most pessimistic predict a 15 percent decline. Among brokerages, Elara Capital anticipates the strongest profit growth for Dr Reddy's. On the opposite end of the spectrum stands Nomura, which forecasts the weakest net profit for the drugmaker, citing heightened competition in key products in the US. What factors are driving the earnings? Dr Reddy's Q1 earnings will rely heavily on the contribution from blockbuster cancer drug Revlimid, especially at a time when other key products in the US are facing increased competition. The product mix will also be a key factor determining the margin performance of the drugmaker. Competition in US business: The pharma company is facing increased competition in ear drop medication Ciprodex and cardiovascular drug Vascepa, which is expected to impact its US sales in the quarter. Nomura factors in a $20 million decline in sales in the US. In addition, a high base of the year-ago quarter will also weigh on Dr Reddy's growth in Q1. The firm had recorded its highest ever US sales in Q1 of the previous fiscal. However, expectations of double-digit growth in domestic sales are expected to somewhat offset the increased competition in key US drugs. Revlimid sales: The drugmaker generates 60 percent of its revenue from the US market, and within that segment, it is Revlimid that has been the biggest sales contributor for the company since its launch. Hence, revenue contribution from Revlimid remains crucial for the drugmaker's topline growth, especially as it is the only major upside trigger for the company. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities pegged Revlimid sales to be around $110 million in Q1, higher than its near $100 million contribution in the past quarter. R&D expenses: The company has been spending more on R&D in the last couple of quarters, largely towards the development of complex drugs to ensure future growth. However, at a time when US sales growth seems unlikely, the high R&D bill is expected to drag down the drugmaker's operating margins. Nuvama also anticipates higher R&D costs (as a percentage of sales) to sustain for the next couple of years due to Dr Reddy's pipeline for the Horizon 2 program, which includes biosimilars and complex products. Likewise, Moneycontrol's poll of nine brokerages estimated Dr Reddy's EBITDA margin at 27.3 percent in Q1, sharply down from 30.5 percent recorded in the year-ago period. What to look out for in the quarterly show? Analysts and investors will closely watch the management's guidance on R&D expenses and EBITDA margin for FY25, as well as the areas of inorganic growth the drugmaker might target. Additionally, attention will be on identifying the expected revenue contribution from Revlimid in FY25.

He expressed disappointment over fund managers and analysts downplaying the impact of the tax change, which is likely to cause a permanent reduction in post-tax returns over the life of equities. Arora pointed out that analysts often react strongly to small earnings changes that are short-term in nature and affect only a few quarters, yet seem to overlook a significant tax change that alters returns over the long term. Arora said, “I am rather amused that analysts who agonize over tiny changes in corporate earnings and other short-term corporate events are blissfully missing the permanent hit to returns.” Follow our live blog for all the market action He further added that when a tech company reports a quarterly growth increase from 4 percent to 5 percent, stock prices can surge by 10 percent the next day, and analysts are quick to change their stance on the stock, with many rushing to buy. “But when you have a 25 percent increase in the tax rate, which will alter your return permanently, there is no impact on markets, and everyone says the market can digest this… I don’t get this logic,” Arora added. Arora noted that India has performed well on a pre-tax basis compared to other countries. Over the past year, India has been the third-best performing market, delivering a dollar return of 18.2 percent compared to 4.85 percent for the MSCI Emerging Market Index. The only country that delivered better returns than India were US, Taiwan, and Pakistan.

Additionally, he highlighted that a stock like Google, with a market cap of $2.2 trillion, offers higher growth potential and has consistently delivered strong performance. “To compete effectively, India should aim to be at least tax-neutral,” Arora concluded. On other aspects of the Budget, Arora said that the best part was the push towards fiscal consolidation. A fiscal deficit projection of 4.9% is laudable, especially as many economies around the globe are facing tough fiscal situations.

The stock has been seeing a sharp rally since it reported stellar earnings earlier this week for the quarter ended June 2024. In the last five days, Suzlon has rallied around 14 percent compared to a 1.5 percent decline in benchmark Nifty, with some analysts seeing up to 18 further upside. After the renewable energy firm reported a 200 percent surge in net profit for the fiscal first quarter at Rs 302 crore and 50 percent surge in revenue from operations to Rs 1,348 crore, several brokerages have retained their bullish calls on Suzlon Energy and even raised price targets. In the FY24–26E period, Geojit Financial Services expects Suzlon’s revenue CAGR & ROE to surpass those of the industry peers. ""We anticipate order inflows to be strong in this period, supported by strong government tendering and from commercial and industrial (C&I) customers,"" it said. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action Despite factoring in the risks in execution numbers, analysts at Geojit expect the revenue CAGR of 53 percent to drive the EPS growth of 66 percent CAGR, resulting in ROE improvement from 18.2 percent in FY24A to 26.9 percent in FY26E. Improved executions, cost optimization from better work-force management, & better pass-through of commodity prices are expected to enable Wind turbine generators (WTG margin) improvement. ""Suzlon 2.0 is a de-levered, optimised, profit making business which has done away with its troubled past and is looking at a vibrant landscape of opportunities in India and abroad,"" said Geojit as it maintained a 'Buy' on the stock with a target price of Rs 73. JM Financial too has reiterated its 'Buy' rating in Suzlon and raised the target price to Rs 71 from Rs 54 earlier. ""We believe that gradual building of momentum for higher execution, healthy order book, more healthy bid pipeline, strengthening of balance sheet and the organization are driving the company for the next-level of growth,"" JM Financial said. Nuvama Institutional Equities, meanwhile, has downgraded the wind energy firm's stock, and while it stays long-term positive on Suzlon Energy, it said that the uptick in order inflows and profits is already factored in, as the stock now trades at 40 times estimated FY27 earnings per share (EPS) of wind turbine generator (WTG) business. ""We remain long-term positive on the sector and Suzlon Energy; however, the expected uptick in order inflow from H2FY25 seems to be already baked in the current market price,"" Nuvama said as it suggested a target price of Rs 64 on the stock.

Additionally, issues such as renewables curtailment, inadequate transmission evacuation, and delays in the auction of renewable projects pose challenges. Increased competitive intensity and a rising market share of Independent Power Producers (IPPs) further complicate the landscape.

"PFC, REC may benefit from enhanced 54 EC bonds attraction after real estate tax shift: Bernstein",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/pfc-rec-may-benefit-from-enhanced-54-ec-bonds-attraction-after-real-estate-tax-shift-bernstein-12778035.html,Market,"July 25, 2024 12:16 PM","The Indian government has recently reduced capital gains tax on real estate sales, but has simultaneously eliminated indexation benefits. This change is expected to lead to an increase in tax outflow for real estate investment gains, depending on the sale price and inflation, according to Bernstein. To mitigate this increased tax burden, investors have two primary options: reinvest the capital from the asset sale into another real estate property or invest in special government 54 EC bonds. The 54 EC bonds, which can only be issued by specific government-backed entities such as Power Finance Corporation (PFC), REC Ltd, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), and Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC), currently offer a coupon rate of 5.25 percent with a five-year duration. This rate is lower compared to the average cost of funds for PFC at 7.4 percent and REC at 7.1 percent. If demand for these bonds rises, it could potentially lower borrowing costs for these two lenders, thereby improving their spreads and return on equity (ROE), Bernstein said. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action The international brokerage had initiated coverage on both PFC and REC stocks with an 'outperform' rating and target prices of Rs 653 and Rs 620 respectively. It views both of these stocks as leveraged power sector plays, despite the associated risks. In its note, Bernstein highlighted that REC and PFC, long overlooked by investors, now boast market capitalisations between $15 billion and $20 billion, with trading volumes nearing $125 million. Despite this, both stocks trade at relatively low trailing price-to-earnings ratios of 8 to 10 times, it said, adding that three types of investors think about these two stocks: those who are enthusiastic about REC and PFC, those who question their relevance, and those who are unaware of these stocks. At 12:00 noon on July 25, REC and PFC shares were trading marginally higher at Rs 606.80 and Rs 525.15 apiece, respectively, on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). In the last one year, both stocks have zoomed 251 percent and 175 percent respectively, beating benchmark Nifty's returns of 23 percent during this period.

"Tech slump knocks Asia shares, yen towers at 2-1/2-month peak",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tech-slump-knocks-asia-shares-yen-towers-at-2-12-month-peak-12778014.html,Market,"July 25, 2024 11:56 AM","Asian shares were hammered on Thursday as a slump in global tech stocks sent investors fleeing into less risky assets, including short-dated bonds, the yen and Swiss franc. Chinese stocks, iron ore and oil prices dropped further after the country's central bank sprang a surprise cut in longer-term interest rates, only stoking further worries about the world's second-largest economy. European markets are set for a lower open, with EUROSTOXX 50 futures down 0.6% while FTSE futures slipped 0.2%. Nasdaq futures , however, rebounded 0.3% and S&P 500 stock futures rose 0.2%. The sell-off in stocks saw investors ramp up bets on rate cuts globally, with futures implying a 100% chance of a Federal Reserve easing in September. A spike in market volatility fuelled a vicious squeeze on carry trades which saw the U.S. dollar sink another 0.7% to 152.78 yen on Thursday. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 1%, while Japan's Nikkei tumbled 3.3%, exacerbated by a 11% plunge in Nissan Motor after its quarterly profit slumped 99%. Taiwan's markets were closed for a second day due to a typhoon. Chinese blue-chips  slid 0.9% with the Shanghai Composite index falling 0.9% to a five-month low. Hong Kong's Hang Seng plunged 1.7%, finding little support from Beijing's latest easing step. On Wall Street, the Nasdaq lost almost 4% - the worst one-day fall since 2022 - as lacklustre Alphabet and Tesla earnings undermined investor confidence in the already lofty valuations of the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks. That added to recent market volatility, with Wall Street's fear gauge jumping to a three-month high. Investors looked for the safety of cash and super-liquid short term debt, with U.S. two-year yields hitting their lowest in almost six months on Wednesday. ""Traders have played outright defence, as the saturated and well-owned tech position continues to be unwound,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone. ""We can also add an ongoing unease around China's growth trajectory, very poor PMIs in Europe and a bearish opinion piece from ex-New York Fed member Bill Dudley, and investors and traders derisked and de-grossed portfolios."" The other big mover in Asia was the safe-haven yen, up 0.7% to the strongest level in 2-1/2 months. It surged 1.1% overnight, with the upward momentum intact ahead of the Bank of Japan's meeting next week where policymakers will debate whether or not to raise interest rates. The Swiss franc also rose 0.2% to 0.8826 per dollar, having gained 0.7% overnight. Short-dated bonds rallied, supported by comments from former New York Fed president Dudley that the central bank should cut rates, preferably at its policy meeting next week. The yield on two-year Treasuries fell another 3 basis points to 4.3894%, having dropped 4 bps overnight. Ten-year yields also eased 2 bps to 4.2622% on Thursday. Markets are fully pricing in a quarter-point rate cut from the Fed in September, with even some risk for a 50 bp cut. For all of 2024, a total easing of 65 basis points has been priced in. ""The rate cut expectations are getting very elevated the same way as they were last year,"" said Andrew Lilley, chief rates strategist at Barreyjoey in Sydney. ""My worry is that the market is getting ahead of the economic data because we have seen previously that these short-term dips in inflation haven't been sustained."" Indeed, advance U.S. gross domestic product data is due later on Thursday and is forecast to show growth picking up to an annualised 2% in the second quarter. The closely watched Atlanta Fed GDPNow indicator points to growth of 2.6%, indicating some risk to the upside. In commodity markets, iron ore prices fell almost 1% as China concerns weigh, while oil prices were pinned near six-week lows. Brent futures fell 0.9% to $80.91 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude also dropped 1% to $76.84. Gold fell 1% to $2,373.62 an ounce .

The FMCG major's April-June earnings growth was helped by a better product mix and sales volume growth. However, the results missed estimates. A Moneycontrol poll of eight brokerages had pegged Nestle India's Q1 net profit at Rs 798 crore, and revenue at Rs 5,060 crore. ""Despite external challenges such as lower consumption growth, concerns on continued food inflation and volatile commodity prices, we have delivered growth across our product groups,"" said Suresh Narayanan, Chairman and Managing Director of Nestle India.

Megacap stock selloff shows investor concerns about too much tech,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/megacap-stock-selloff-shows-investor-concerns-about-too-much-tech-12777858.html,Market,"July 25, 2024 10:49 AM","A tumble in the heavyweight stocks that have powered markets higher this year is highlighting Wall Street's vulnerability to any weakness in the Big Tech trade and causing concerns that over-stretched stocks are in for more turbulence. Disappointing quarterly reports from Tesla and Google-parent Alphabet sparked a crushing market selloff on Wednesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite falling 3.6% in its worst day since October 2022. The benchmark S&P 500 slumped 2.3%, with the earnings reports causing concerns about upcoming results from the other big tech firms. ""This was the hair trigger for people saying, 'Wow, I've got way too much exposure to information technology and growthier type companies,'"" said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at GLOBALT, about Tesla's results, after the electric vehicle automaker posted its lowest quarterly profit margin in five years. ""The trade ... is to get more diversified."" The rout comes after optimism about artificial intelligence technology fueled a months-long rally in a handful of massive technology and growth companies including chipmaker Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon, pushing the S&P 500 to record highs this year. The megacap stocks - dubbed, with Meta Platforms and Apple, the Magnificent Seven - have accounted for around a third of the S&P 500's 14% gain in 2024, making their trajectories a key factor in how broader markets will perform. As share prices soared, concerns grew over companies' stretched valuations and comparisons to the dotcom bubble of more than two decades ago became more frequent. The S&P 500 is trading near 22 times expected earnings, its highest in over two years, and well above its 10-year average of 18, according to LSEG data. Signs of nervousness around tech stocks began to creep up in recent weeks, as the blistering rally in many of the market leaders seemed to run out of gas. One signal came from the rise in the Cboe Volatility Index, known as Wall Street's fear gauge because it measures demand for portfolio protection. The measure shot to its highest level in three months on Wednesday. Hedge funds have been reducing their exposure to markets for the last two weeks, prime brokers at both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley said in notes last week, amid fears that gains from earlier this year could evaporate if sentiment around tech stocks changed. Andrew Volz, chief operating officer at prime broker Clear Street, said hedge funds continued to deleverage their portfolios on Wednesday, selling long positions and covering bearish bets. ""There were definitely general liquidations of things like Nvidia, Tesla, all the big seven tech companies,"" said Volz. EARNINGS OPTIMISM OVER-DONE? Though the S&P 500 is still just 4% below an all-time high hit earlier this month, some investors worry that Wall Street may have become too optimistic about earnings growth, leaving stocks vulnerable if companies are unable to meet expectations in coming months. One example could be seen on Wednesday, when Alphabet's shares fell more then 5%. While the company reported better-than-expected revenues, investors grew wary that rising investments in AI infrastructure would squeeze margins and YouTube was facing tough competition for ad dollars. ""We set the bar too high on earnings,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management. ""Even Alphabet's earnings beat, but the market obviously wasn't impressed and they didn't beat by enough."" Many other Magnificent Seven stocks saw sharp declines on Wednesday. Tesla shares fell more than 12% in their worst daily drop since 2020, while Nvidia's lost 6.8%. Microsoft shares fell 3.6% and Apple lost 2.9%. Wednesday's selloff is likely to leave investors on tenterhooks in coming weeks, as more tech earnings come in. Meta, Microsoft and Apple are all scheduled to report next week, potentially ramping up volatility if any one of them disappoints or assuaging investor fears if the results are strong. ""We're in a little bit of a pullback. But to me, it's really just a short-term thing,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York. ""If we see some good numbers in the coming days, it could reverse just as quickly.""

Even though this net profit came in well above the Street's estimate of Rs 5,797 crore, it was the rise in non-performing assets that worried investors. Sequentially, the lender's gross non-performing assets rose 11 basis points to 1.54 percent in Q1 while net non-performing assets were up 3 basis points to 0.34 percent. Puneet Sharma, the chief financial officer of the company, in a post results press call, stated that this pressure on asset quality was due to seasonality on the retail agri business in the first quarter.

Credit costs refer to expenses incurred by a lender due to default or potential default on loans. The management indicated that roughly 55 percent of the increase in credit costs was due to lower recoveries and upgrades in the corporate loan portfolio. Although they expect these recoveries to eventually take place, the timing could shift between one and two quarters. ""We need to factor in that seasonality played a spoilsport for sequential rise in non-performing assets (NPAs) and expect credit costs to go higher amid lower pace of recoveries,"" Axis Bank stated during its earnings conference call.

The block deal, worth Rs 1,100 crore, likely saw private equity firm EQT (formerly Baring PE Asia) exit the lender. Following the block deal, shares of RBL Bank slumped over 3 percent in trade. Around 4.8 crore shares of RBL Bank changed hands at an average price of Rs 229.50, implying an 3.5 percent discount to the previous closing price of the stock. Even though the buyers and sellers of the transaction could not be immediately confirmed, CNBC-TV18 had reported on July 24 that Baring PE, which has invested in RBL Bank through its vehicle Maple II BV was to sell 4.78 crore shares or 7.9 stake in the lender. Through the equity sale, Baring PE was looking to exit RBL Bank, making Rs 1,080 crore for its stake. The stake sale also tipped off a spike in volumes in the counter as 5 crore shares changed hands on the exchanges so far, manifolds the one-month daily traded average of 64 lakh shares.

The lender also announced plans for a Rs 3,500 crore Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) and a Rs 3,000 issuance of debt securities via private placement. These plans for a fundraise come at a time when the lender is targeting a 20 percent growth in its loan book over the next two financial years, primarily led by an increase in secured retail assets.

India may introduce a simpler regime to improve ease of doing business for overseas investors  India could take steps to create a simpler regime for overseas investment by diluting the rigid distinction between foreign portfolio investment and foreign direct investment, economic affairs secretary Ajay Seth told the Economic times. Rules could also be revisited to help Indian industrialists whose overseas investments are greater than those in the country to invest locally more easily. Why it’s important: Current regulations do not make for smooth sailing for these categories of investors, which the government wants to address. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her budget speech said FDI and overseas investment rules will indeed be simplified. 2. Corporate India ready for capex spree to expand capacities once demand shows uptick  CEOs across business sectors are ready to expand capacities, expecting the government’s target to invest a record Rs 11.11 lakh crore on infra development will act as a catalyst for a jump in consumer demand, the Business Standard reported. For the past few years, the investment scene in India has been dominated by government capital expenditures and private investments in manufacturing sector have remained muted. Why it’s important: Capex will rise only when domestic consumption becomes stronger and external demand rises. A flood of cheap Chinese imports has also made local firms wary of expanding capacities. 3. Over 70 percent of intraday traders incurred losses in 2022-23, regulator’s study finds  Over 70 percent of intraday traders in the equity cash segment incurred losses in 2022-23, the Hindu Businessline reported, citing a study by the Securities and Exchange Board of India. The number of individuals participating in such trades rose by 300 percent in the four financial years ending March 2023. Why it’s important: The share of young intraday traders under 30 years of age has grown to 48 percent in 2022-23, up from 18 percent in 2018-19. The losses indicate overconfidence in a trader’s ability to generate regular income by predicting daily price movements. More awareness is needed in this matter. 3. Global capacity centers may expand footprint on stable taxation and litigation regime Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s proposal to provide certainty in international taxation and reduce litigation for global IT firms operating in India can further spur the massive expansion of global capability centers, the Economic Times reported. The Centre aims to expand the scope of safe harbor rules and streamline transfer pricing assessment procedure, which could see a near threefold expansion of captive units to a $120 billion sector by 2030. Why it’s important: The GCCs are India-registered entities providing services to global parents and thus attract strict transfer pricing provisions under tax laws. Any easing will lead to lead to better predictability and acceptance. It would an industry boosting measure. 5. Tax deducted at source for income from government bonds may deter retail investors  Just when retail investors are warming up to investing in central and state government securities via online platforms such as RBI Retail Direct, a budget proposal on deduction of tax at source on income from these instruments could prove to be a dampener, the Hindu Businessline reported. From October 1, investors may have to factor in a 10 percent TDS outgo when investing in G-Secs and State Development Loans. Why it’s important: Participation of retail investors in the G-Sec market has been rising in the past few years through online portals. Although the TDS proposal would improve tax compliance, practical implications need careful management to avoid discouraging investment in these financial instruments. 6. Piramal’s financing arm eyes overseas bond markets to diversify fundraising  Piramal Capital & Housing Finance, currently reliant on bank funding, plans to continue accessing the overseas bond market to diversify its borrowing sources, the Business Standard reported. The diversified NBFC aims to increase its borrowing from global sources to 10 to 12 percent over the next 2-3 years, up from the current 4 percent. It issued its maiden dollar-denominated bond this week, raising $300 million. Why it’s important: The macroeconomic environment in the country is prompting many bigwigs of India Inc to tap the overseas bond market for funding. Piramal is the latest to join that bandwagon. 7. Changes in capital gains tax will benefit most people, says top tax bureaucrat  The changes in the capital gains tax announced in the budget for 2024-25 are rational decisions that will benefit people in most scenarios, and it is for the government to decide on the suggestions that come up, Central Board of Direct Taxes chairperson Ravi Agarwal told the Mint in an interview. Why it’s important: There has been all-round consternation on the raised rates and changed time periods in calculating capital gains tax. Whether it does benefit most taxpayers remains to be seen. 8. Government mulling industry call to lift restrictions of Chinese foreign direct investment  The central government is holding discussions on industry’s calls for easing restrictions imposed on Chinese investment into the country as also granting visas to experts for setting up plants, but is yet to take a final decision, the Economic Times reported, citing top government officials. The Economic Survey tabled in Parliament has also batted for easing Chinese investments into the country. Why it’s important: Industry lobby groups want an easier visa regime for expats, including those from China, at a par with the one proposed for firms in the sectors under the government’s production-linked incentive schemes. The finance minister, too, has hinted at a revamp of foreign direct investment regime. 9. Lower customs duty for gold and jewelry could see consumer rush ahead of wedding season  The budget proposal to pare customs duty has sparked a gold rush at jewelry stores as consumers hurry to stock up on the yellow metal ahead of a busy wedding season, the Economic Times reported. Customers have begun flocking to jewelry stores to benefit from the reduced rates of gold, mostly buying heavy stuff that had eluded them for the last six months as gold prices scaled a record Rs 74,000 per 10 gm. Why it’s important: There are worries, which could be unfounded, that the extraordinary surge in demand could prompt a rollback of the lower customs charges. The fears could be overblown. 10. Higher user fees at 16 major airports in India adds to rising airfare burden for fliers  Since the beginning of the current financial year, 16 airports have raised user development fees, the Mint reported. Airports at Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Mangaluru, Thiruvananthapuram, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Lucknow, Kannur, Kochi, Chennai, Kozhikode, Kolkata, Goa, Bhubaneswar, Patna, and Srinagar have raised these fees in a range of 2 to 200 percent, the civil aviation ministry said. Why it’s important: The widespread increase in airport charges is an additional burden to fliers facing higher airfares this year and comes on the back of airline firms struggling to find enough aircraft to serve soaring demand.

According to analysts, L&T has a dominant position and market share in most operating verticals which imparts flexibility to cherry-pick projects, which helps optimise overall business profitability. Larsen and Toubro's consolidated net profit for the quarter ended June 2024 jumped 12 percent on-year to Rs 2,786 crore, and its revenue from operations rose 15 percent YoY to Rs 55,120 crore. International brokerage Citi has maintained a 'Buy' rating on L&T with a target price of Rs 4,396, highlighting its strong positioning to benefit from growth in capex in India and the Middle East. L&T continues to be Citi's top pick in the sector. Emkay Global has maintained its 'buy' rating on L&T, albeit lowering the target price to Rs 4,100 from Rs 4,200 per share earlier due to an earnings cut in FY26-27E on account of lower other income estimates. According to the brokerage, while the capital goods major's Q1 performance surprised positively, muted execution was seen in the domestic market mainly due to heat-waves and general elections during the quarter. However, execution is likely to see pick-up in the second half of the year. While the management guided lower order prospects (both YoY and sequentially, especially in Hydrocarbon) at Rs 9.1 lakh crore, FY25 guidance on order inflow, revenue and margin has been maintained. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action The management pointed to labor availability challenges across markets which should improve gradually. According to Nuvama Institutional Equities, transportation, factories and buildings segments will drive growth for the company in the near future. ""Strong projects pipeline over the next five years in verticals like transportation (railways, metro and roads) and factories and buildings augurs well for L&T. Moreover, proven execution record and huge balance sheet equip it to garner a higher share of the huge Rs 40 lakh crore infra capex opportunity over FY21-23E,"" the brokerage said. L&T has been amongst the few players to exit from non-core businesses generating huge balance sheet muscle over recent years, according to analysts.

Here's an in-depth analysis on our World Street's July 25 edition. Wall Street sees worst declines in 2 years A market wipeout overnight led US stock indexes to their worst losses since 2022, as disappointing profit reports from Tesla and Alphabet dampened Wall Street's enthusiasm for artificial intelligence technology. The S&P 500 fell 2.3 percent, marking its fifth decline in six days. The Dow Jones dropped 504 points, or 1.2 percent, while the NASDAQ composite slid 3.6 percent. Ford Motor in slow lane Ford Motor fell short of Wall Street's second-quarter earnings expectations but exceeded revenue forecasts, largely due to ongoing warranty costs. Despite increasing its full-year target for free cash flow, the automaker kept its 2024 earnings guidance unchanged, which disappointed some investors anticipating an upward revision. Ford's annual guidance includes adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) between $10 billion and $12 billion. As a result, the company's shares dropped about 11 percent overnight. IT outage trouble CrowdStrike has pledged to enhance its software testing procedures following a faulty content update for Windows systems that caused a global IT outage on July 19. The cybersecurity company's error led to significant disruptions for banks, hospitals, and airlines, as millions of PCs experienced ""blue screens of death."" Big Tech earnings begins! Google parent Alphabet kicked off Big Tech’s earnings season on July 23, providing Wall Street with an initial glimpse into digital ad and cloud spending for the quarter. The company reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, driven by strong Search ad performance and ongoing cloud growth. However, it fell short in YouTube ad sales. What's sizzling? Chipotle Mexican Grill reported quarterly earnings and revenue that exceeded analysts' expectations, driven by increased traffic at its restaurants despite an industry slowdown. The company reaffirmed its full-year outlook, projecting same-store sales growth in the mid- to high-single-digit percentage range. Additionally, Chipotle expects to open between 285 and 315 new restaurants this year. US house demand depressed US existing home sales fell more than expected in June, despite the median house price reaching a new record high.

India may tweak rules to check hot flows on bond index entry,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/india-may-tweak-rules-to-check-hot-flows-on-bond-index-entry-12777631.html,Market,"July 25, 2024 07:38 AM","India may amend rules for the issuance of new bonds that are eligible to trade on global indexes if large inflows spur volatility, according to a top finance ministry official. The government has an option to tweak the fully accessible route for securities that will be issued in the future, the person said, asking not to be identified as the discussions are private. It may impose a limit on foreign inflows in the so-called FAR bonds if there’s an excessive surge in flows, the official said. A Finance Ministry spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request seeking comments. The central bank has designated a class of bonds that can have full foreign ownership. JPMorgan Chase & Co. has included securities from this set of bonds into its emerging markets index that India joined last month. Foreign funds have poured $12 billion in these index-eligible bonds since the inclusion announcement in September. The US bank has said about $25 billion of inflows may come in as India’s weight on the index goes up to 10% by March. The nation’s central bank has been mopping up most of the dollars coming in, with its foreign exchange reserves swelling to a record. It also sold bonds in the secondary market this month to sponge off some of the rupee liquidity. Earlier this month, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das said he was not worried about any deluge of inflows resulting from the index inclusion. The RBI has “multiple instruments” to deal with it, Das said.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 fell 3.7% weighed down by its largest constituents. Alphabet Inc. slid 5% after sinking more resources into its drive to outmatch rivals in AI, with spending higher than analysts expected. Tesla Inc.’s profit miss and the Robotaxi delay spurred a 12% stock plunge. Nvidia Corp fell 6.8%. “Investors are finally waking up to all that AI spend and realizing it is much more of an expense right now rather than a revenue generator,” said Peter Boockvar at The Boock Report.  The yen steadied Thursday after rallying more than 1% to the strongest levels against the US currency since May in an advance that reflected an unwind in carry trades. The move is “potentially squeezing the yen short positions, given yen-funded carry trading has been a popular strategy over the last few years,” Saxo Capital Markets’ head of FX strategy Charu Chanana wrote in a note. The Bank of Japan is likely to stand pat on interest rates for longer in a boost to the nation’s equities, according to BlackRock Inc., which has a high conviction investment view on Japanese stocks. The BOJ meets later this month. In the bond market, Treasuries gained Thursday in Asian trading after the curve steepened in the previous session on bets the Federal Reserve is close to cutting rates. Australian and New Zealand longer-dated yields rose Thursday. Former New York Fed President William Dudley called for lower borrowing costs — preferably at next week’s gathering. For many analysts, such a move would be worrisome as it would indicate officials rushing to avoid a recession. Later Thursday in the US, investors will see further evidence of the health of the economy with US GDP and initial jobless claims data being released. An index of dollar strength was little changed Thursday after a similarly flat Wednesday. The Canadian dollar held declines from the prior day as the Bank of Canada cut rates for a second consecutive meeting and signaled further easing was ahead. In the Philippines, the nation’s central bank suspended currency trading for a second day due to Typhoon Gaemi. Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea’s economy flipped back into reverse last quarter adding to challenges for policymakers as they struggle to stimulate investment and consumption. Big Tech PullbackAfter driving the rally in stocks for most of 2024, big tech slammed into a wall. Traders rotated from megacaps to lagging parts of the market, spurred by bets on Fed rate cuts and concern AI still needs to pay off. “Tech’s problem isn’t just that earnings are less than perfect, but the group is still caught up in the violent rotation trade that kicked off with the June CPI,” said Vital Knowledge’s Adam Crisafulli. “Many assumed the anti-tech rotation would be ephemeral and the fact it’s proving durable is compounding anxiety toward the group and spurring additional selling pressure.” The drubbing in these stocks has seen some of the air come out of valuations. While that’s something that could argue in favor of dip buying, the earnings season is just getting started. Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are all due to report results next week. In commodities, oil steadied after posting its first gain in five sessions. Gold was little changed early Thursday after a 0.5% drop in the prior session.

Not only was the Budget a disappointment but also a sobering reminder that stock market sentiment does not figure high up on the list of the policy makers' priorities. The market has now fallen for four sessions in a row, but benchmark indices are down barely 1.5 percent. ""Prima facie, hiking the rates is negative, but the rebound from the Budget Day lows is telling you that people are still ready to buy into equities,"" answers Rahul Arora, CEO of Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities. Still, it is not a conviction in fundamentals, but rather the fear of missing out that is drawing retail investors in hordes, say market watchers. Last night, US equities plunged with the Nasdaq diving 3.6 percent, its steepest decline in 21 months. The S&P 500 fell 2.3 percent, its worst single day fall in over 18 months. Globally, investors are fretting about expensive valuations and Indian investors may soon realise that stock prices cannot stay disconnected from valuations indefinitely. Coforge (Rs 6,318, +2.2%) Q1 FY25 results met expectations. Bull case: Signs of recovery in BFSI and increased headcount suggest strong growth potential. Merger with Cigniti expected to enhance operating margins by FY27. Bear case: EBIT margins declined due to higher visa and headcount-related costs. Pace of new project initiation was slow. Failure to realise merger synergies, higher-than-expected deflation in Cigniti’s testing services pose key risks. KNR Constructions (377.50, +5.31%) Stock rallied in response to Budget announcements of infra projects Bull case: Rs 2.52 lakh crore or nearly 50 percent of the capex has been budgeted for the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, thereby providing larger opportunities. Further diversification into other segments bodes well for the company. Has de-risked its transportation business with diverse geography and low client concentration. Bear case: Lower project awarding, delay in execution of irrigation projects and new orders at lower margin owing to aggressive bidding by developers endangers its future growth prospect. Higher input costs may also impact margins. Kajaria Ceramics (Rs 1,466, +1.87%) Profit fell more than expected in Q1FY25 Bull case: The company expects double-digit volume growth despite a slow start in first quarter of this fiscal year. Pickup in exports and robust demand in real estate sector can help bolster investors' sentiment around the stock as well. Bear case: After June-ended quarter was impacted due to elections, a lot depends on the demand pickup. Tiles exports for the industry was flat YoY in April and May due to high freight rates. If freight rates fail to normalise, it can be negative for stock's future prospects as it can offset strong domestic sales as well. HUL (Rs 2,720.95, down 1.64%) Reported a decent set of first quarter earnings. Bull case: The firm will see low-single digit volume growth as near term operating environment continue to be competitive, in the best-case scenario. The premiumisation thrust could pay off, giving higher returns at better margins. Bear case: An overzealous focus on the premium portfolio could isolate its rural consumers. Margins are expected to remain flat, according to guidance. (With inputs from Lovisha, Neeshita, Zoya, and Harshita)

MC Exclusive: Political limits to central government capital spends; capex to grow at nominal GDP growth: Neelkanth Mishra,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/political-limits-to-central-government-capital-spends-capex-to-grow-at-nominal-gdp-growth-neelkanth-mishra-12777059.html,Market,"July 25, 2024 09:27 AM","Neelkanth Mishra, Chief Economist at Axis Bank and an influential voice in the government suggested that government capex will likely see a modest growth in coming years compared to what we have in the post-pandemic period. He said that the growth in capex will align with nominal GDP growth for two main reasons. Firstly, the government doesn't need to spend more because its primary objective is to make counter-cyclical adjustments in demand. As steady-state demand picks up, evidenced by the real estate cycle, and expansions in steel and power capacity, the government should slow down its spending, as macroeconomic conditions require. Read: L&T Q1 Results: Net profit jumps 12% to Rs 2,786 crore Secondly, there's a political limitation on how much the central government can spend. Under the constitution, its control extends only to national highways, railways, airports, and telecom. Mishra discussed the limitations of infrastructure spending. On roads, there is a cap on expenditure given the current capacity; with 150,000 kilometres of national highways needing repairs every decade, the annual repair rate maxes out at 16,000-18,000 kilometres, making the scope for increasing road repairs limited. Read more: India losing skilled labor to infrastructure projects in Middle East: L&T CFO Railway spending is growing, which is promising, but the growth will be gradual, potentially reaching Rs 4.5-5 lakh crore annually in five years. However, this increase won’t be immediate, he added. In telecom, significant funds have been allocated to BSNL, which is expected to launch its network by Diwali or the end of the year, setting the stage for future 5G investments. Also read: Direct tax relief for middle class in Budget 2024 is ‘sufficient’: Revenue Secy For major ports and airports, Mishra said that spending is constrained by the nature of the projects—airports, for instance, involve limited expenditure on runways and buildings. Mishra also highlighted that the pace of defence projects limits rapid acceleration in government spending. As a result, the industrial and investment cycles are shifting, with the private sector beginning to play a more prominent role. From a stock market perspective, this will mean moving away from some of those stocks into stocks that are driven more by a surge in private capex. He suggested that the stellar rally in sectors like defense and railways have stretched valuations. ""How much do you want to pay for it? That has to be corrected in railways. I mean, there's a pace at which these companies can grow. Some of these stocks will be trading at 100 times earnings is ridiculous,"" the market veteran added.

"Oil prices ease on concerns over weak China demand, Middle east ceasefire talks",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/oil-prices-ease-on-concerns-over-weak-china-demand-middle-east-ceasefire-talks-12777623.html,Market,"July 25, 2024 07:19 AM","Oil prices eased on Thursday as concerns over weak demand in China, the world's largest crude importer, and expectations of a nearing ceasefire deal in the Middle East overcame gains in the previous session after draws in U.S. inventories. Brent crude futures for September fell 38 cents, or 0.5%, to $81.33 a barrel by 0129 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for September slid 33 cents, or 0.4%, to $77.26 per barrel. Benchmarks settled higher on Wednesday, snapping three straight sessions of declines after the Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude inventories fell by 3.7 million barrels last week. That compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1.6-million-barrel draw. [EIA/S] U.S. gasoline stocks dropped by 5.6 million barrels, compared with analysts' expectations for a 400,000 draw. Distillate stockpiles fell by 2.8 million barrels versus expectations for a 250,000-barrel increase, the EIA data showed. ""Despite draws in U.S. crude and gasoline stocks, investors remained wary about weakening demand in China and expectations of advancing ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas added to pressure,"" said Hiroyuki Kikukawa, president of NS Trading, a unit of Nissan Securities. This year, China's oil imports and refinery runs have trended lower than in 2023 on lower fuel demand amid sluggish economic growth, according to government data. Slumping U.S. stock markets also reduced traders' risk appetite, Kikukawa added. All three main indexes on Wall Street ended lower on Wednesday. In the Middle East, efforts to reach a ceasefire deal to end the war in the Gaza Strip between Israel and militant group Hamas under a plan outlined by U.S. President Joe Biden in May and mediated by Egypt and Qatar have gained momentum over the past month. On Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sketched a vague outline of a plan for a ""deradicalized"" post-war Gaza in a speech to U.S. Congress and touted a potential future alliance between Israel and America's Arab allies. ""If Middle East ceasefire talks progresses, U.S. equities continue to slide, and China's economy remains sluggish, oil prices could fall to early June levels,"" said Satoru Yoshida, a commodity analyst with Rakuten Securities.

S&P 500 snaps longest streak without a 2% decline since 2007,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sp-500-snaps-longest-streak-without-a-2-decline-since-2007-12777615.html,Market,"July 25, 2024 06:39 AM","A steep selloff in high-flying technology stocks sent the S&P 500 Index to its worst day since December 2022, ending its best stretch without a 2% decline since the start of the global financial crisis in 2007. The US equities benchmark slid 2.3% on Wednesday, ending 356 sessions through Tuesday without a drop of at least 2% — its longest streak in 17 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This comes after the index rose as much as 15% above its 200-day moving average last week — a crucial level that has historically foretold past selloffs. “All good things must come to an end — but this isn’t the end of the world for the US stock market,” said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. “The rotation trade into small caps and value is still on, with volatility picking up as weak seasonal factors come into play ahead of US election season.”  Wednesday’s losses came as Tesla Inc. shares fell 12% in the biggest drop since September 2020 after falling short of second-quarter profit estimates. Google parent Alphabet Inc. also saw weakness in its YouTube advertising revenue, knocking the Nasdaq 100 Index about 3.7% lower for its worst day since October 2022. That pushed the S&P 500 4.2% below its all-time closing high. With Wall Street projecting that the tech behemoths’ profit growth is poised to slow, that means it will be key to see whether the dip-buyers come back again as more Big Tech companies unveil results in the coming weeks. Investors will continue to get a fresh look at Corporate America’s profit engine, with Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. all set to report next week. That said, declines in other corners of the market outside of Big Tech like small caps were not as severe as traders grow more confident about interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in the near future.  The S&P 500 had been on a torrid rally that’s pushed it above 5,600, notching 38 all-time closing records this year — among its best stretches of records at this point in the year this century, behind 2021, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The index’s current bull run has added $17 trillion in market value since it touched its nadir in October 2022. Of course, equities have been locked in a tight range of late, with the S&P 500 spending only 25 out of 141 trading sessions in 2024 moving at least 1% in either direction, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Now investors are heading into what’s historically been the worst stretch of the year for stocks in August and September. “This is more about a heavyweight tech unwind that’s influencing the benchmarks,” said Todd Sohn, managing director of ETF and technical strategy at Strategas Securities. “It’s painful, but good for the overall market beyond growth stocks since non-tech stocks are still hanging in there.”

'Fear gauge' hits three-month high as US stocks sell off,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/fear-gauge-hits-three-month-high-as-us-stocks-sell-off-12777612.html,Market,"July 25, 2024 06:27 AM","A hefty U.S. stocks sell-off sent Wall Street's most watched gauge of market volatility to a three-month high and boosted options trading volume on Wednesday, though strategists saw little evidence of panic. The S&P 500 slipped 2.3%, on pace for its worst daily loss since late 2022, after Tesla and Alphabet reported lackluster earnings, prompting investors to question if the 2024 rally fueled by Big Tech and artificial intelligence is sustainable. As stocks tumbled, the Cboe Volatility Index - known as Wall Street's fear gauge because it measures demand for protection against stock swings - shot to 18.46, the highest since late April. Options on the VIX changed hands at nearly twice the usual pace on Tuesday, Trade Alert data showed. The sell-off spotlighted the broader market's vulnerability to any weakness in Big Tech, which has boosted indexes even as it sparked concerns over stretched valuations and recalled the dotcom boom more than two decades ago. Still, the decline so far has been more an orderly retreat than a rout, options market participants said. ""We're not seeing a whole lot of fear in the marketplace, meaning that people aren't going out and trying to buy protection aggressively,"" said Matthew Tym, head of equity derivatives trading at Cantor Fitzgerald. ""It's kind of very orderly and kind of passive, which indicates to me that nobody's in a bad spot right here yet."" Despite the recent wobble, months of strong equity market returns have likely left investors in a strong position to stomach a modest uptick in volatility, Tym said. The S&P 500 is up 14% year-to-date, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 - which fell 3.5% on Wednesday - has gained 13%. The indexes are off 4% and 8% from their all-time highs, respectively. Nvidia , whose blistering rally has fueled a big part of the broader market's gains, fell 6% on Wednesday but is still up about 130% for the year. The VIX index at 18 remains below the peaks touched during recent weak market episodes. In October the index climbed as high as 23 during a sharp sell-off. Big tech earnings is not the only thing on investors' minds. Political uncertainty, an expected shift in Federal Reserve policy and the seasonally weak stretch for stocks in September and October have raised the allure of portfolio protection, for some investors. Others, however, were taking advantage of the greater market volatility to bet that calm will return soon. ""While the crowd is hedging and hoping to time the in and out with that hedge, I'm shorting UVXY/VXX outright, as it climbs, and will simply await the inevitable plunge in volatility,"" said Seth Golden, president of investment research firm Finom Group. He was referring to ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF and the Barclays iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN , ETFs that rise in value when volatility rises.On Wednesday, UVXY was up 20% and the VXX rose 14%.

About 1,748 shares advanced against 596 declining shares on the NSE. Consolidation is expected to continue, with 24,400 as immediate support followed by key support at 24,100, while 24,600-24,700 is the zone to watch out for on the higher side. Here are some trading ideas for the near term: Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital NTPC | CMP: Rs 393  NTPC has shown clear outperformance after breaking out of its multi-year resistance from the 2018 swing high in June 2023. Before this breakout, the stock had been in an underperforming zone, consolidating within a range. Following the breakout, the stock has consistently formed higher highs and higher lows, indicating robust momentum. During this rising trend, the stock has exhibited bullish mean reversion from minor dips, with purchases occurring around the 12-week and 26-week averages, highlighting strong price structural development. Another notable point is that the stock's RSI (Relative Strength Index) has not fallen below the 50 mark since December 2022, and the weekly RSI remains above 60, signifying a positive trend backed by bullish momentum. On the volume front, the stock has experienced substantial delivery volumes recently, indicating significant participation from large investors. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 472 Stop-Loss: Rs 360 Emami | CMP: Rs 800  Emami has been a standout performer, exhibiting strong price development that suggests a continuation of its upward trajectory.

On a weekly scale, Emami has consistently formed higher highs, reinforcing the trend continuation. The stock is also maintaining its position above key moving averages, such as the 12-week and 26-week averages. Additionally, the momentum indicator MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is trending higher, which denotes a positive trend supported by bullish momentum. Furthermore, on the ratio chart of Emami against Nifty, there was a notable reversal in April 2024 from a downward-sloping trend line. Since then, Emami has continued to outperform the broader market, showcasing its robust performance. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 966 Stop-Loss: Rs 730 Indian Hotels Company | CMP: Rs 633  Indian Hotels has been a standout performer from 2020 to 2024, consistently trending higher within a rising channel. The stock gained further momentum after breaking out in 2022 from a rising trend line connecting the swing tops from 2006, maintaining its upward trajectory since. Indian Hotels has successfully sustained above key moving averages. The momentum indicator remains in positive territory, indicating a robust alignment of trend and momentum on the monthly scale. The ratio chart of Indian Hotels against the Nifty reveals an interesting relative performance of the stock. It is on the verge of breaking out from the 2006 swing high, and currently, it is sustaining well, reinforcing the likelihood of continued outperformance in the future. Looking ahead, the stock appears poised for further gains. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 743 Stop-Loss: Rs 584 Castrol India | CMP: Rs 270.55  Castrol India has recently picked up momentum after a long period of underperformance since 2014, showcasing robust price structural development. On the monthly scale, the stock displayed a change in polarity in June 2024 and the current month, confirming the start of a fresh upward leg. On the weekly scale, the stock has shown resilient price stability. Notably, it has witnessed robust participation from investors, represented by the highest volume seen in the July series, further indicating the stock's readiness to outperform broader indices. The stock has also demonstrated bullish mean reversion, with every dip bouncing back from the 12-week and 34-week EMAs towards an upward trajectory. The RSI study shows a breakout from the sloping trend line and has formed a double bottom formation on the weekly scale, reinforcing the bullish momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 332 Stop-Loss: Rs 250 Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst, Capital Market Strategy at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas Mahindra Holidays and Resorts India | CMP: Rs 467  Mahindra Holidays was in a consolidation mode for the last four weeks. It has taken support at the support cluster zone of Rs 437 – 430 where support parameters in the form of the 40-day moving average and the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement levels were placed. The daily momentum indicator has triggered a fresh positive crossover, which is a buy signal. The stock has witnessed a sharp surge with above-average volume. Thus, technical parameters are suggesting a sharp rise over the next few trading sessions.

"Trading Plan: Will Nifty 50 manage to defend 24,400, Bank Nifty hold 51,000 on Thursday?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trading-plan-will-nifty-50-manage-to-defend-24400-bank-nifty-hold-51000-on-thursday-12777571.html,Market,"July 25, 2024 12:16 AM","The benchmark Nifty 50 continued its lower high formation since hitting a record high last week, falling by a third of a percent with higher volumes on July 24. However, it has consistently defended the 24,400 level for the third straight session. If the index breaks this level, the next support lies at 24,100, but if it manages to hold, then 24,600 can't be ruled out in the coming sessions. For Bank Nifty, 51,000 is likely to be an immediate support, with a 51,600-51,800 resistance zone, experts said. On Wednesday, the Nifty 50 slipped 66 points to 24,414 despite positive breadth, and the Bank Nifty declined 461 points to 51,317. On the NSE, 1,748 shares advanced, while 596 shares declined. Nifty Outlook and Strategy Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst, Capital Market Strategy at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas On the daily charts, we can observe that the Nifty traded within the range of the previous trading session. The intraday pullback fizzled out at the key hourly moving averages placed in the range of 24,480 – 24,520. The trend for the Nifty has changed to range-bound between 24,800 – 23,800. The daily momentum indicator has a sell signal, and thus the ideal strategy would be to sell on a rise around the resistance zone of 24,500 – 24,550. On the downside, we expect levels of 24,200 – 24,000 from a short-term perspective. Key Resistance: 24,550, 24,630 Key Support: 24,100, 23,800 Strategy: Sell Nifty on a rise to resistance at 24,500 – 24,550, with a stop-loss of 24,730 and a target of 24,250 - 24,100. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Nifty remained below the 21-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the hourly chart throughout the day, suggesting near-term weakness. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is showing a bearish crossover and is declining. On the options front, significant Put writing was visible at the 24,000 and 24,100 strikes, with maximum Put open interest at 24,000. Meanwhile, Call writers were very active at the 24,400 and 24,600 strikes. A decisive fall below 24,400 might trigger a correction towards 24,100-24,000. Key Resistance: 24,600, 24,800 Key Support: 24,400, 24,100 Strategy: Buy Nifty 24,350 strike Put (July 25 expiry) above Rs 50, for a target of Rs 100 and stop-loss of Rs 24. Shitij Gandhi, Senior Technical Research Analyst at SMC Global Securities For the upcoming session, we believe that the 24,200-24,100 zone would act as a strong support zone for the Nifty, and the trend remains in favor of bulls as long as we hold above this zone. Key Resistance: 24,600, 24,700 Key Support: 24,200, 24,100 Strategy: Buy on dips near 24,300, with a stop-loss below 24,100, and a target of 24,600. Bank Nifty - Outlook and Positioning Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst, Capital Market Strategy at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas Bank Nifty witnessed follow-through selling pressure and has been leading in the recent fall. We expect the weakness to continue. Some of the key heavyweights of the index, i.e., ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, and SBI, which were the key outperformers, have entered the correction phase, and hence the underperformance is likely to continue. Selling on a rise around 51,800 – 51,700 should be the ideal strategy to trade in Bank Nifty. On the downside, the target is placed at 50,600. Key Resistance: 51,800, 52,000 Key Support: 51,000, 50,800 Strategy: Sell Bank Nifty on a rise to 51,700, with a stop-loss of 52,000 and a target of 50,600. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Bank Nifty continued to fall, remaining below the short-term consolidation breakdown. Sentiment might remain weak as it closed below its support level of 51,700 and its 21-day Exponential Moving Average. A sell-on-rise approach might favor traders until the index closes above 52,000. The support is placed at 50,900, where the 50-day EMA lies. On the other hand, resistance is seen at 51,550 and 52,000. Key Resistance: 51,550, 52,000 Key Support: 51,000, 50,700 Strategy: Buy Bank Nifty (July 31 expiry) 52,000 Call at Rs 230, for a target of Rs 400 and a stop-loss of Rs 180. Shitij Gandhi, Senior Technical Research Analyst at SMC Global Securities The immediate support for Bank Nifty now stands at the 50,500-50,000 zone. On the higher side, Bank Nifty is likely to face a strong hurdle in the zone of 52,000-52,500. We expect some consolidation to be seen in the index as long as the 50,000-52,500 zone remains intact. However, any breakout from the defined range is likely to gauge further direction into the index. Key Resistance: 52,000, 52,500 Key Support: 50,500, 50,000 Strategy: Buy Bank Nifty on dips near 51,000, with a stop-loss below 50,500, and a target of 51,800.

India losing skilled labor to infrastructure projects in Middle East: L&T CFO,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/india-is-losing-skilled-labor-to-infrastructure-projects-in-the-middle-east-says-lt-cfo-12777466.html,Market,"July 24, 2024 10:02 PM","Engineering and infrastructure conglomerate Larsen & Toubro (L&T) on July 24 said that India is losing a large portion of its skilled labor to infrastructure projects that are being executed in the Middle East. ""Markets like Middle East which are investing lot of money in infrastructure development, there is so many Indians working there,"" L&T's chief financial officer R Shankar Raman said on July 24. Shankar Raman while speaking on the company’s post Q1FY25 earnings conference call said that the Indian government should look to provide better conditions for labor in India. ""So if we are able to provide the conditions appropriate to India, the biggest lever differentiator is tax-free income there (in Middle Eastern countries),"" Shankar Raman said. He added that there is a fundamental difference between tax-free earnings versus taxable earnings. ""I think the government in India requires tax revenue, it requires everybody to pay tax except this agriculture sector which I do not understand,"" Shankar Raman said, adding, ""For whatever reason, we have decided to keep the largest employment sector not taxed, but the rest of the sector increasingly are being sought to be taxed."" He added that just increasing the salaries of laborers by Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 is not the underlying issue with the Indian market, rather it is a deeper issue and it requires a lot of of concurrence between the government, private sector, and India's growing working population. Shankar Raman added that there is growing disinclination to doing manual work and instead people are looking for better automation, equipment, and living conditions. The CFO of the engineering conglomerate also said that increasing the salaries of laborers is not a big issue for large infrastructure companies. ""If you put all the labor costs at the higher emoluments together in the context of the overall project cost, it could possibly change the yield by 1 percent,"" Shankar Raman said. He added that he was not very sure as to how India would meet its aspirations with Indian labor. Last month, L&T had flagged that it was experiencing a ""severe"" shortage of skilled labor across various projects, attributed to factors such as extreme weather conditions and disruptions caused by elections. The company's managing director SN Subrahmanyan. had said that L&T was facing a shortage of approximately 25,000-30,000 laborers in June 2024. The Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) sector in India is indeed grappling with a shortage of skilled labor. One of the key factors contributing to the shortage is climate change, executives point out that extreme weather conditions have caused laborers to drop out of projects. ""We have specific a HR for Labour. We have private labor colonies... we also taken measures to transport people in buses, taking measures to give them health and energy drinks during breaks. Early morning when they come to us, we give them breakfast late night when they go we give them dinner. So such arrangements have been made,"" Subrahmanyan had said in June. He further pointed out the shortage of engineers in its IT business. ""There is a need for about 20,000 engineers within L&T... We are augmenting the shortage with training centres to upskill the with necessary requirements."" There is also 10 to 12 percent attrition at Larsen & Toubro, Subrahmanyan pointed out. As of March 31, 2024, the company had 59,344 total employees of whom 4,459 were women and the remaining men.

""As we look ahead, we see a very encouraging order prospect pipeline. And if you were to quantify that opportunity, it indicates a prospective pipeline of over Rs 9 trillion,"" L&T's Chief Financial Officer R Shankar Raman said. Shankar Raman , while speaking at the company's post Q1FY25 earnings conference call, said that around 60 percent of the prospective order pipeline of Rs 9 trillion will come from projects in India. The prospective order pipeline for the energy sector is about Rs 2 trillion rupees, he added. ""The thrust to infrastructure, the thrust to energy transition, that both the Indian government and the international governments have placed, augurs well and is supportive of the mix of the order pipeline that we are able to access presently,"" the CFO of the the engineering and infrastructure conglomerate said. The consolidated order book of the L&T group stood at Rs 4,90,881 crore or Rs 4.9 trillion as on June 30, 2024, with international orders having a share of 38 percent, the company had said on July 24. The order book of Rs 4,75,809 crore represents a growth of 19 percent over Rs 4,12,648 crore as on June 30, 2023 and Rs 3,63,448 crore as on June 30, 2022, L&T had said. The CFO said that the slowdown in order inflows seen in Q1FY25 from the Indian market was mainly on account of the Lok Sabha elections and should not continue going forward. In Q1FY25, L&T saw its order inflow rise to Rs 70,936 crore, a growth of 8 percent over the corresponding quarter of the previous year, due to strong ordering momentum from countries in the Middle East. However, Shankar Raman warned that the ongoing Israel-Hamas war can disrupt order inflows. ""My base case assessment is if things stay as they are today, this underlying tension will continue in the ecosystem,"" Shankar Raman said. He added that despite the on-going geopolitical concerns, countries like Saudi Arabia have created an in-depth plan for 2030 and 2035. Shankar Raman said that there exists opportunities worth $60 billion from infrastructure projects in the middle eastern countries, out of which L&T is targeting to win 5-10 percent.

Axis Bank expects credit costs to go higher after Q1 asset quality declines,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/axis-bank-expects-credit-costs-to-go-higher-after-q1-asset-quality-declines-12777413.html,Market,"July 24, 2024 08:36 PM","Following a decline in asset quality during the June-ended quarter, Axis Bank forecasts a continued increase in credit costs, primarily due to a slower pace of recoveries, which is expected to exert further pressure on the bank's financial outlook. ""We need to factor in that seasonality played a spoilsport for sequential rise in non-performing assets (NPAs) and expect credit costs to go higher amid lower pace of recoveries,"" Axis Bank stated during their earnings conference call. The private lender reported a gross NPA ratio of 1.54 percent for the quarter ended June, an 11 basis point increase quarter-on-quarter (QoQ). Similarly, the net NPA ratio increased by 3 bps QoQ to 0.34 percent in Q1FY25 amid rising credit costs. The net credit cost stood at 0.97 percent in Q1FY25, up 47 bps year-on-year (YoY). Credit costs refer to expenses incurred by a lender due to default or potential default on loans. ALSO READ: Axis Bank Q1 results: April-June net profit rises to Rs 6,035 crore The management indicated that roughly 55 percent of the increase in credit costs was due to lower recoveries and upgrades in the corporate loan portfolio. Although they expect these recoveries to eventually take place, the timing could shift between one and two quarters. ""Yes, there is deterioration seen in our asset quality across parts of the book, but it is not concerning enough because it has not breached our risk thresholds,"" the management assured. Axis Bank also reported a muted increase in net profit in Q1FY24 due to a substantial rise in loan loss provisions. The private sector lender’s net profit rose 4 percent YoY to Rs 6,035 crore in Q1FY25, while net interest income increased by 12 percent YoY to Rs 13,448 crore.

"STCG tax hike may extend holding period of equities, says A Bala",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/stcg-tax-hike-may-extend-holding-period-of-equities-says-a-bala-12777381.html,Market,"July 24, 2024 08:34 PM","The hike in long term capital gains tax and short term capital gains tax was not in-line with market expectations but could still have some positive impact in terms of longer holding period for equities, says A Balasubramanian, MD & CEO of Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC. “An increase in short-term capital gains tax by 5 percent might lead investors to hold their assets longer, which could be beneficial for the equity and mutual fund markets. Additionally, while the 20 percent rise in long-term capital gains tax might sound substantial, its impact over a 5-10 year holding period is relatively minimal,"" he said. He also discussed the changes in real estate tax. The removal of the indexation benefit means that property sales will now be taxed at a flat rate of 12 percent, compared to the previous rate of 20 percent with indexation. ""The removal of indexation could lead to higher taxes for long-held properties, but this change is more about simplifying the tax structure rather than making a significant impact on tax liabilities,"" he explained. ALSO READ: Markets are not kind to Budgets: Moneycontrol analysis Despite these adjustments, he sees a strategic purpose behind the tax changes. ""From a fiscal perspective, these changes make sense. The government needs to balance its budget, and raising taxes is one way to achieve that. The focus seems to be on smoothing out market volatility and directing funds where they're needed,"" he said. Turning to the implications for various sectors, Balasubramanian remained optimistic about the real estate market. ""The reduction in property tax rates is likely to boost the sector, especially as it starts to gain traction after years of stagnation. This move could make real estate a more attractive investment, benefiting both urban and rural housing,"" he added. He, however, believes that these changes are unlikely to divert significant investment away from equities. ""While the budget might bring some shifts, the overall attractiveness of equities for long-term returns remains strong.

Tandon observed that, aside from the tax changes, there haven’t been major shifts from the interim to the final budget. “There was concern about significant capex reductions and potential fiscal compromises, but the market has remained relatively stable post-budget.

Treating equities like other asset classes is flawed: Bharat Shah of ASK Group,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/treating-equities-like-other-asset-classes-is-flawed-bharat-shah-of-ask-group-12777243.html,Market,"July 24, 2024 07:19 PM","Veteran market expert Bharat Shah expressed disappointment over the Union Budget 2024's changes to capital gains tax, arguing that treating equities like other asset classes is flawed. He emphasised that equities are a crucial value-creating asset for households and inherently carry greater risk. ""Equities are clearly much, much higher up the ladder in terms of risk asset. And therefore, to harmonise the capital gains tax rate in the same way to some other asset probably is not the ideal comparison between the two asset classes,"" Shah, executive director at ASK Group said in an exclusive conversation with Moneycontrol. Shah explained that since equity markets are among the greatest allocator of resources in the desired channel, it promotes both capital efficiency for investors and raises capital for the listed entities. Secondly, the asset needs to be prioritised as it is still meaningfully low at 6 percent of household assets - a figure that ideally needs to grow to at least 25-30 percent over a period of time. ALSO READ: 21 Budget stocks that may benefit from FM Nirmala Sitharaman's announcements Further, Shah believes that since equities carry a greater degree of risk compared to other assets, the tax rates should have been in parity with that risk profile. ""If you see mutual fund houses, when they buy or sell stocks, neither do they pay any short-term gains tax nor any long-term gains tax. However, the same asset held by an individual needs to pay short-term as well as long-term tax,"" he pointed out. Given this context, Shah said that he would have preferred that the capital gains tax structure should have been kept unchanged for the time. Commenting on which sectors he has been bullish on, Shah said that he preferred businesses that enjoy growth higher than GDP growth. ""We are optimistic about energy, infrastructure, specialty manufacturing, and companies leveraging digitisation. Energy transition and infrastructure development offer significant growth opportunities. Additionally, businesses emphasising sustainable and circular economy practices are well-positioned for future growth,"" he added. While the budget reflects a strategic approach, focusing on fiscal discipline and prioritising capital expenditure, Shah said that the tinkering of capital gains tax structure could have been avoided.

Benchmark indices ended slightly lower on July 24, with activity being lacklustre. Moneycontrol takes a look at how some of stocks in different sectors reacted to the announcements in the Budget, now that the market has had sufficient time to digest the fine print. Sector: Banking and financial services Key measure: Three crore houses announced under PM Awas Yojana, two crore of that in rural and one crore in urban. Additionally, Rs 4,000 crore allocated for credit-linked subsidy schemes under PMAY-Urban, up from Rs 0 in FY24. Beneficiaries: Housing finance companies Market view: Allocation lower than expectations but can be revised upward later, says Kotak Securities. Affordable housing focused HFCs with a higher share of urban salaried borrowers to benefit more, says Kotak Stock performance: LIC Housing Finance (Rs 786, +2.5%), HUDCO (Rs 314.7, +2.41%), Can Fin Homes (Rs 850.3, +0.89%) Key measure: Increase in long term capital gains tax, short term capital gains tax and Securities Transaction Tax Losers: Broking firms Market view: Brokers earning a big chunk of revenues from derivatives trading commissions could be hit once higher STT on derivatives trades becomes effective from October 1.  Higher STCG may result in individual investors churning their portfolio less frequently, hurting cash market commissions as well. Stock performance: Angel One (Rs 2,180, -1.94%), 5 paisa (Rs 474.9, +2.14%), IIFL Securities (Rs 463, +2.81%) Sector: Auto Key measure: Focus on Rural Development and Agriculture & Allied Activities, with  total outlay of Rs 2.65 lakh crore and Rs 1.52 lakh crore, respectively. Beneficiaries: Two-wheeler companies Market view: Higher disposable income in rural areas could spur demand for two-wheelers. Stocks of two-wheeler companies have broadly lagged their passenger vehicle counterparts post Covid. Stock performance:  TVS Motors (Rs 2,456.25, -0.65%), Mahindra & Mahindra (Rs 2,815.7, -0,2%), Hero MotoCorp (Rs 5,440, -1.33%) Key measure: Customs duty rate on the import of minerals such as lithium, copper, cobalt, and rare earth elements required for manufacturing lithium-ion cells used in electric vehicle batteries fully exempted. Beneficiaries: Battery makers Market view:  Amara Raja Energy and Exide Industries to gain, says Axis Securities. Both stocks have run up over the last six months. Further gains could be gradual, say brokers. Stock performance: Amara Raja Energy and Exide Industries (Rs 1,571.1, +1.63%), Exide Industries (Rs 540.3, -1.18%) Sector: Consumption Key measure: Schemes to boost employment and skilling of youth through five schemes at an outlay of Rs 2.1 lakh crore. Beneficiaries: Consumer staples companies Market view: Higher employment means higher disposable income, which in turn will drive demand for staples. But the street will watch for signs of rural demand recovery as valuations already expensive. Stock performance: HUL (Rs 2,720.95, -1.64%), Dabur India (Rs 633.55, -2.87%), Emami (Rs 798, -0.28%) Sector: Real Estate Key measure: Reduction in long-term capital gains (LTCG) on property sales from 20% to 12.5%, but indexation benefit goes too. Beneficiaries/losers: Property developers Market view: Limited impact on buyers who purchase homes for personal consumption, says Kotak Institutional Equities. Bad news for investors in property, as it could dent returns in a high inflation regime.  This could reduce demand from investors in the short term. Stock performance: Kalpataru ( Rs 377.5, 3.78%), Prestige (Rs 1,880, 6.68%), Sobha (Rs 1,835, 3.44%) Sector: Hotels and tourism Key measures: Rs 2,479 crore allocate for the sector, a three-fold growth over the past two years' budget, most of which will go towards the Swadesh Darshan scheme. Beneficiaries: Hotels, airlines, luggage makers Market view: Not a game changer. Also, the Budget did not relax the GST slabs on travel and hospitality, nor did it grant the sector ""infrastructure"" status. Outlook on all three industries positive, but it is already reflecting in current valuations of the listed players. Stock performance: Lemon Tree ( Rs 149, 4.98%), Indian Hotels ( Rs 635, 1.84%), IXIGO ( Rs 172.01, 0.63%) Sector: Infrastructure Key measure: Aggregate capex of Centre at Rs 11.1 lakh crore unchanged, compared to the interim budget. Allocations for key verticals like roads, railways and water also remained unchanged. Key measure: 3 crore additional houses to be built under PM Awas Yojna over next 5 years. Allocation of Rs 26,000 crore for highway development in Bihar and Rs 15,000 crore for Andhra Pradesh's development Beneficiaries: Cement companies Losers: Capital goods, EPC companies, defence and railways Market view: A disappointment, considering that the allocations were expected to be increased. “Muted allocation is sentimentally negative for the infrastructure sector. Weak growth in allocation for Roads and Water is also reflective of slower project awards in FY23/24,"" said JM Financial. Stock performance: Ambuja Cements ( Rs 684.75, -0.95%), IRB Infra ( Rs 67.35, 1.65%), KNR Constructions (Rs 377.50, 5.31%) Sector: Fertilizers and Agriculture Key measure: Rs 1.52 lakh crore for agriculture and related sectors, including schemes on productivity, Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) for coverage of farmers and their lands over three years, a digital crop survey in 400 districts, and the issuance of Jan Samarth-based Kisan Credit Cards. Beneficiaries: Fertilizer companies Market view:  ""Fertilizer companies may further benefit due to higher agricultural spend,"" noted Axis Securities. Stock performance: Coromandel Fertilizer (Rs 1,628, 2.76%), Godrej Agrovet (Rs 862, 3.87%) Sector: Power Key measures: Continued focus on energy transition. PMi Suryaghar Yojana  has seen 1.28 crore registrations and 14 lakh registrations.  Pumped storage projects to be announced for renewable energy projects in the coming days. Research and development of nuclear reactors, also underway. Key beneficiaries: Power generating companies, and also power sector financiers Market view: Capital outlay for Reform Linked Distribution Scheme (RLDS) increased by 21 percent over FY24E RE. Higher allocation for RLDS likely to benefit power equipment manufacturers and EPC contractors, say analysts at SBI Securities.

"All stakeholders not satisfied, but Budget has something for everyone",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/all-stakeholders-not-satisfied-but-budget-has-something-for-everyone-12777366.html,Market,"July 24, 2024 06:11 PM","It is safe to say that the full Union Budget for 2024-25 has something for everybody. This is particularly impressive in light of the continued emphasis on fiscal consolidation. This budget also lays out the pillars that will drive India’s progress towards Viksit Bharat or developed India. According to the finance ministry’s latest numbers, the Indian government’s fiscal deficit is expected to be brought down to a five-year low of 4.9 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the current financial year ending March 2025. Moreover, the finance minister has reiterated the government’s commitment to “staying the course” and reducing it further to under 4.5 percent of GDP in 2025-26. It is worth recalling that this reduction in the fiscal deficit has been managed despite two crucial counteracting forces: an incredible increase in capital expenditure and the cleaning-up of the government’s finances. Please read: Our complete Budget coverage It is essential to not underestimate this dynamic. If achieved, this would be a tremendous achievement considering it usually gets more and more difficult to compress the deficit as it treads lower levels on account of the committed expenditure of the government, such as salaries, pensions, and subsidies. But crucially, the fiscal deficit for 2024-25 has also been reduced in absolute terms to Rs 16.13 lakh crore. The estimates for the central government’s borrowings have also been reduced in both gross and net terms compared to the interim Budget. This can only create more space for the private sector to access funds. The capital expenditure target has been retained at the interim Budget level of Rs 11.11 lakh crore, but it must be noted that this is still more than 17 percent higher from last year’s capex. India is, by far, the world’s fastest growing large economy. The challenge, recognised by one and all, is inclusion. Hence, creating enough and more jobs is paramount. In recent months, there has been plenty of debate on whether the economy has been providing the requisite amount of employment to the youth. While disagreements over the finer details are common in every discussion, it should not derail further progress. The government has not let that happen, with each of the nine priorities of the 2024-25 Budget – from ‘Employment & Skilling’ to ‘Next Generation Reforms’ – aimed at directly or indirectly boosting the availability of jobs in the future. The Budget continues to deliver on its promise to make the working environment more conducive for job generators, with the corporate tax rate on foreign companies being cut to 35 percent from 40 percent, the so-called ‘Angel tax’ being abolished, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises getting further support in various forms, and the development of ‘industrial parks’ in or around a hundred cities. Households have not been forgotten either, with the new personal income tax regime getting another boost in the form of a 50 percent increase in standard deduction to Rs 75,000 and improvements to the rate structure. Market has taken in its stride, increase in securities transaction tax, on futures and options trading and capital gains tax. The Budget-making exercise in India is rather complex. Invariably, not all stakeholders will be satisfied to the fullest extent. But it speaks volumes when the government is able to offer something to everyone even as it maintains the path of fiscal prudence. The finance minister has recognised what is essential for strong and stable growth and delivered on it.

And indeed at the macro level, we have done well with high real GDP growth and a macroeconomy that is approaching $4 trillion. On understanding complexities For a Survey of its breadth and depth, there are many things one can pick on, but none as quickly as the courageous statement that suggests that ‘few people outside government (living or dead) can understand the complexity of governance in India’ The complexities relate to economic, cultural, geographic, regional and others. Arguably, even within government the understanding of this complexity could be rare. For if such complexities were understood in their entirety, the government would eschew the temptation of making palpably unattainable promises and policy makers would push back against such targets. I am speaking of doubling farmer’s income in five years, increasing employment by 20 million and achieving $2 trillion worth of exports to name just a few. These are obviously political statements and acumen would demand they be appreciated as such. To however, mask the weaknesses of the economy, whether these are structural or cyclical, internal or external, self-inflicted or circumstantial and attribute the challenger’s narrative to a lack of understanding is disingenuous at best and an attempt to divert at worst. It is also unkind to the intelligence of academics, sociologists and economists, historians and demographers among others who spend their time engaging in deep and meaningful research of India and its peoples. The Cambridge economist Joan Robinson who visited India for only a few days but worked on the Indian economy for several years had famously said that whatever you say about India at a point in time, the exact opposite is also true at the same point in time. Many people within and outside government have quoted Joan Robinson no doubt because they agree with that assessment. Economic Survey leads to budget’s core theme Notwithstanding, I feel this year’s Economic Survey has played a crucial role in identifying the several difficulties that confront the Indian economy. Primary among these has been the slow employment creation especially in the formal sector even in the face of fast GDP growth.  The corporate sector has not only done well, but is ‘swimming in profits’. A high growth economy in which 800 million people receive some sort of food subsidy is neither economically nor politically sustainable is the message that is loud and clear in the Survey and to my mind it was the focus of the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s first budget in this election cycle. A thrust for employment creation is writ large in both the Survey and the budget. Development of industrial parks close to cities, reenergizing the smart cities program, bringing back the focus on transit oriented development (ToD), creation of urban rental housing and dormitories are examples of proposals that are aimed to encourage labour intensive manufacturing, possibly the only sensible way to address India’s employment challenge. While the Production Linked Incentive scheme is being reinforced by increasing allocations to sectors such as semiconductor and pharmaceuticals, the budget has buttressed this by an employment linked incentive scheme, or ELI.  The government will provide monetary incentive while the corporate sector would have to train interns or the youth entering the labour market for the first time.  Corporate funding is recommended from their corporate social responsibility pool. This comes on the back of an earlier not so successful scheme to encourage labour intensive employment where the government paid part of the provident fund contribution to first time employees in certain sectors. Multiple channels of enabling job creation The current internship scheme that seeks to train 10 million youth in five years has the potential to unleash the energy of youth in the companies they are placed in. It could create multiplier effects but the proof will naturally lie in the quality of implementation and the keenness of the corporate sector. The job creation agenda is also visible in the proposals to develop religious tourism and tourism in general in the eastern part of the country. Tourism is a labour intensive activity. The enhanced allocations for MSMEs under the Mudra scheme, especially labour intensive manufacturing is another reflection of the focus of employment. The principal message in this budget is to double down on skill and job creation, including for women. The responsibility of this agenda has been placed squarely on the profitable shoulders of India’s private sector. It is interesting that the budget speech did not mention public sector employment, which has remained an aspiration, especially among rural youth. The employment goal will perhaps reverberate and resonate in policy circles for the next five years in this election cycle.  Getting rid of process clutter Simplifying processes in India is work in progress. This budget moves the needle on that. Simplifications have been proposed in tax administration as well as in the bankruptcy code. It is a common occurrence in India that resources, whether tax revenues meant for the government or debt recovery for creditors, these get stuck in endless litigation because of our complex procedures resulting in deadweight losses. Simplification is therefore a welcome step and will get a further boost as the government finalises the economic policy framework in the next six months. These next generation reforms seek to cover all factors of production, namely land, labour, capital and entrepreneurship, and use technology as an enabler for improving total factor productivity and bridging inequality. Effective implementation of several of these reforms requires collaboration between the Centre and the states and building consensus, since development of the country is inextricably linked with development of states. Federalism, cooperative and otherwise The competitive and cooperative federalism that was the hallmark of several budgets between 2014 and 2019 has remained on paper except for the implementation of GST, which according to Arvind Subramanian, former CEA, was a monumental achievement in cooperative federalism. The Survey too emphasises the need for harmonisation across levels of government and across different policies between and within sectors.  Agriculture has been mentioned as a case in point in which subsidies to water electricity and fertilizers coexist with minimum support prices and export bans from time to time. These policies conflict and create rents, damaging the economic fabric. Inverted duty structures are also prevalent, creating policy conflicts that the FM has promised to address in the next six months. A budget to counter narratives  The fiscal consolidation agenda remains on track with a windfall from the RBI and higher than expected tax revenues. The middle class have received a little respite in tax liabilities but those investing in stocks and other assets will have to pay long-term capital gains of 12.5%. Incentives for the poor, tax breaks for the middle class and additional taxes for the rich in the budget seek to moderate the narrative that the rich are getting richer while the poor are finding it difficult to catch up. The budget is however only a start. It is not taxing the rich more that will address the problem. As Joseph Schumpeter observed, the market's achievement does not consist in providing silk stockings for queens but in bringing them within reach of factory girls. And the only way that can happen is to create productive employment opportunities for India’s burgeoning youth, including women. The budget has made a start. Now, for the follow through.

Baring PE, which has invested in RBL Bank through its vehicle Maple II BV, will sell 4.78 crore shares at a floor price of Rs 226 per share. This implies a discount of up to 5 percent from the current market price of RBL Bank's stock. On July 24, RBL Bank's shares on BSE closed 1.25 percent higher at Rs 238.7 apiece. This block deal could represent an exit for Baring from the lender as its latest shareholding pattern shows Maple II BV holds 7.89 percent stake. The private lender's standalone net profit jumped 28.95 percent to Rs 371.52 crore on 21.47 percent increase in total income to Rs 4,301.70 crore in Q1FY25 over Q1FY24. Net interest income grew 20 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 1,700 crore in the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Last month, RBL Bank said it will raise up to Rs 6,500 crore through a combination of qualified institutional placement (QIP) of shares and debt sale. The bank will raise Rs 3,500 crore through QIP and Rs 3,000 crore through issue of debt securities via private placement, according to an exchange filing. This will be RBL's first share issue via institutional placement since 2021 when the bank saw an abrupt management transition and the central bank increased scrutiny of the lender by temporarily appointing a director on its board amid reports of a large share of unsecured borrowing on its books. The fundraising comes at a time when the lender targets 20 percent growth in its loan book over the next two financial years, largely led by an increase in secured retail assets. RBL, however, did not mention how it would deploy the proceeds of the latest capital raise.

"Removal of indexation benefit raises tax burden, may dampen investor sentiment",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/removal-of-indexation-benefit-raises-tax-burden-may-dampen-investor-sentiment-12777309.html,Market,"July 24, 2024 05:47 PM","The Budget 2024 announced a significant change for the real estate sector by removing the indexation benefit on the sale of property, reducing the Long Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax rate from 20 percent to 12.5 percent, but applying it without the indexation benefit. Experts believe this will increase the overall tax burden for property sellers and dampen investor sentiment. However, they also see potential growth in affordable and mid-level housing segments due to government initiatives aimed at revitalizing MSMEs and infrastructure development. What is indexation benefit? Indexation is used to adjust the purchase price of an investment to reflect the effect of inflation on it. The government has clarified that the indexation benefit for properties bought after 2001 will be removed while retaining it for properties bought before 2001. Also Read | Investors likely to shy away from buyback offers post-budget proposal Tax burden or tax saving? Former president of CREDAI Jaxay Shah said the impact of the proposed changes would be neutral if the average property return is 12 percent over more than four years, with inflation at 5 percent. However, if the return exceeds 12 percent with 5 percent inflation, there could be a tax saving under the new amendment compared to the current rate, Shah added. Nitin Bavisi, CFO, Ajmera Realty & Infra India explained in a conversation with Moneycontrol that for the sale of a property acquired after 2001 in 2024 or thereafter, the capital gains tax will be 12.5 percent instead of 20 percent earlier. Meanwhile, the long-term capital gains tax on equities has been hiked to 12.5 percent from 10 percent. ""So, if one considers moving the capital out from long-term capital gains from shares and securities, they are moving out with a higher tax effect of 25 percent. However, with real estate they are moving out with a 37.5 percent reduced tax effect,"" he said. Impact on demand, supply Developers heavily reliant on investors will be adversely affected. However, the elimination of the indexation benefit when applying LTCG means the overall tax outflow will be higher under this new regime. This move is likely to dampen investor sentiment, removing key incentives and directly impacting developers dependent on investors, said Sachin Bhandari, Executive Director and CEO, VTP Realty. Shishir Baijal, Chairman and Managing Director, Knight Frank India believes that if the property's value has increased more than the inflation rate, the new 12.5 percent tax rate is expected to be more advantageous for real estate sellers compared to the previous 20 percent tax rate after adjusting for indexation. Also Read | Five key stocks expected to benefit from the Budget The removal of indexation benefits could potentially lower demand from investors since indexation adjusts the purchase price for inflation, thereby reducing capital gains tax on property sales. Sans this benefit, the tax liability increases, and this will reduce the attractiveness of real estate as an investment when viewed against other asset classes, said Prashant Thakur, Regional Director & Head – Research, ANAROCK Group. According to Jain, high-value properties will be most impacted, and we may see a reduction in demand for them. Primary home buyers might not be affected as much since their main motive for buying homes is to use them for residence, not for investment returns. However, overall market sentiment could influence even end-user decisions, he said. Price corrections in real estate? Real estate developers may respond by offering incentives and focusing on affordable housing to attract buyers in the primary sales market. ""It may reduce speculative demand and increase supply, leading to some price corrections. In the short term, this could result in a notable price decline as sellers compete for fewer buyers,"" Thakur said. However, over time, the market will regain stability and prices will reflect genuine end-user demand rather than demand by speculative investors. Developers may shift their crosshairs to affordable and mid-segment housing, he added. Mitesh Jain, Partner at Economic Laws Practice, noted the overall increase in capital gains taxes across various investments. He pointed out that while the LTCG rate on property has been reduced, the removal of indexation will likely result in higher taxes, particularly affecting lower and middle-income taxpayers. Meanwhile, Dhruv Agarwala, Group CEO of Housing.com and PropTiger.com, sees the removal of the indexation benefit as a major shift that could increase the tax burden on real estate transactions. Despite the reduction in the LTCG tax rate, he believes the changes could lead to higher taxes for property sellers. Overall, Budget 2024's strategic investments and reforms are expected to drive substantial growth in the real estate sector, benefiting both developers and homebuyers alike.” Impact on realty stocks Despite the concerns regarding the removal of the indexation benefit, shares of realty companies staged a sharp rebound on July 24, surging up to 8 percent. Shares of Macrotech Developers were up 3 percent, Sobha up 3.4 percent, Prestige Estates up 6.7 percent, Ajmera Realty up 3.21 percent and Oberoi Realty gained 3 percent.

Linde India stock jumps 5% after SEBI rebuke; shareholders eye refund of related party transaction monies,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/dishonest-misleading-defence-even-at-charitable-best-sebi-has-harsh-words-for-linde-india-in-its-final-order-12777329.html,Market,"July 25, 2024 12:48 PM","Linde India Ltd stock jumped on 25 July, a day after capital-markets regulator SEBI exchanged harsh words following the examination of the company's related party-transactions (RPTs) with Praxair India Pvt Ltd (PIPL) and Linde South Asia Services Pvt Ltd (LSASPL). After Linde India submitted that the capital-markets regulator has made ""bald innuendos"" in its interim order, the capital-markets regulator issued a final order that stated that the company's counter can ""at its charitable best, be termed as dishonest and misleading"". The interim order was issued on April 29 and the final order on July 24. In the final order, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has asked NSE to appoint a valuer to value the business lost to the related party transactions. The transactions were entered into through a joint-venture, shareholders' agreement signed between LIL and PIPL. Shareholders may expect that money to flow back into the company. Linde India stock was trading at Rs 8,333 in the early afternoon trade, up 5.7 percent from the previous close. Sebi has also asked LIL to reimburse the expenses incurred by NSE for the valuation and to test the materiality of future RPTs as per the threshold provided under Regulation 23(1) of the LODR Regulations on the basis of the aggregate value of the transactions entered into with any related party in a financial year, irrespective of the number of transactions or contracts involved. Also read: SAT sets aside Sebi's order against Linde India in related party transactions case Why the harsh exchange? The regulator started investigating the RPTs after receiving complaints from LIL's shareholders that the transactions were entered into without obtaining their approval and that they were not to LIL's best interests. After initial investigations, Sebi had passed an interim order, which noted that LIL had sought shareholder approval for the RPTs in its 85th AGM held on June 24, 2021. This resolution was rejected by the shareholders with 93.94 percent of the votes cast against it. The interim order also noted that the company sought legal opinion after this. The regulator's interim order said that the proposal put forward by the company at its AGM showed that the company understood that these RPTs would cross the materiality threshold, as given under Regulation 23 of the Listing and Obligations and Disclosure Requirements (LODR) Regulations. The company countered this by saying that Sebi was making ""bald innuendos"" to say that the company's interpretation of Regulation 23  was the same as Sebi's. The company stated that the resolution on the transactions was proposed at the AGM was “only out of apprehension that such RPTs might breach the specified sub-limits given under the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies Rules or that the value of a single contract with Praxair might cross the Materiality Threshold at a later date owing to the pandemic” This ""contention"" raised on behalf of the company, Sebi said, ""can, at its charitable best, be termed as dishonest and misleading"". Background The JV&SHA was entered into to set up Linde South Asia Services (LSASPL), in which both LIL and PIPL held 50 percent each. LSASPL was meant to provide administrative and support services to LIL and PIPL. But, the agreement also contained a clause which allocated products and geographies to LIL and PIPL. It gave PIPL got exclusivity in HyCO, Hydrogen, Carbon Monoxide, Green Energy, gasification and CO2 including carbon capture businesses (“HyCO”). LIL's shareholders raised issue with this, saying that the agreement essentially promised future business to PIPL at the expense of LIL. LIL countered that business allocation did not mean exchange of services or assets to PIPL and therefore did not need to approval of LIL's shareholders. But Sebi has held that transfer of business opportunities should be scrutinised.

A Budget proposal that could help Sebi address SME IPO concerns,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/a-budget-proposal-that-could-help-sebi-address-sme-ipo-concerns-12777327.html,Market,"July 24, 2024 05:42 PM","The government’s decision to lower the long-term capital gains tax rate for transfer of unlisted shares is likely to help address a growing concern in the SME IPO space, which is already high on the regulatory radar due to frequent instances of unusually high level of subscription and listing gains. While presenting the Union Budget on July 23, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that LTCG tax on unlisted shares will be reduced to 12.5 percent. Earlier, it was taxed at 20 percent with indexation benefit. “… the amount of income-tax calculated on such long-term capital gains (for unlisted securities)… at the rate of twenty percent for any transfer which takes place before the 23rd day of July, 2024; and at the rate of twelve and one-half percent for any transfer which takes place on or after the 23rd day of July, 2024,” stated the Finance Bill 2024. This assumes significance as this has done away with the spread that existed earlier in terms of the LTCG tax rates for listed and unlisted securities. For listed shares, it was 10 percent prior to the budget, which was hiked to 12.5 percent. Simply put, the LTCG tax rate now for listed and unlisted shares is same at 12.5 percent. Market participants say this would lead to many promoters of SMEs raising funds by diluting stakes in the private market as there would be no real tax incentive of doing that on the exchange platform. Also Read: SME IPOs continue to pour amidst regulatory concerns Doing a stake sale through an IPO also entails compliance and regulatory costs and those can be avoided as well when doing a private sale, they add. “This will give fillip to stake sales in the private space especially in the SME segment as the tax benefit spread is no more there plus such stake sales will be much easier and quicker to execute,” says Bhavin Shah, Partner, Private Equity Leader, PWC. This would be welcome news to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), which has been highlighting its concerns around the SME IPO segment, which was launched way back in 2012. “We do see signs of manipulation in the SME (small and medium enterprises) segment… We are able to see certain patterns. However, as per our regulation, the way that we need to construct the entire case, we do need to take some time to do that in a robust manner,” SEBI chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch had said in March. Also Read: 'We see signs of manipulation in the SME segment,' says SEBI chairperson Recently, the National Stock Exchange (NSE) also tightened the norms for the segment, while putting a 90 percent cap on the stock price movement on the day of listing. There have been nearly 22 SME IPOs this year that saw their respective share prices more than double on the day of listing itself. Market participants further believe that such a move was warranted as the current calendar year has also seen many SME IPOs that were subscribed in multiple of hundred times. The IPO of HOAC Foods India and Magenta Lifecare was subscribed 1963 times and 1003 times, respectively. Further, there were another 35 SME IPOs that were subscribed between 200 and 800 times each. Meanwhile, the current calendar year has already seen as nearly 120 SME IPOs till June with a cumulative fund raising of Rs 3,644 crore. This assumes significance as 2023 saw a record number of 182 SME IPOs getting launched with the total fund raising pegged at an all-time high of Rs 4,686.11 crore.

Capital gains tax hike: Déjà Vu of 2018 market trends?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/capital-gains-tax-hike-deja-vu-of-2018-market-trends-12777274.html,Market,"July 24, 2024 05:34 PM","When Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had introduced a 10 percent long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) in the 2018 Budget, markets dipped slightly on February 1, with the Sensex and Nifty each falling by about 0.1 percent. A week later, the indices dropped around 4 percent, with sectoral indices like Nifty Bank, Realty, and Energy declining 5.2 percent each, and Nifty MidCap 100 and SmallCap 100 losing 4.8 percent each. A month after the budget, the Sensex and Nifty fell over five percent. Nifty Bank dropped nine percent, while MidCap and SmallCap indices fell 6.1 percent  and 5.4 percent, respectively. With the 2024 Budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has proposed raising the LTCG tax on all financial assets, including equities, to 12.5 percent from 10 percent, and increasing short-term capital gains tax from 15 percent to 20 percent. Following the announcement, both the Sensex and Nifty fell by 0.1 percent each. Could we see a repeat of the 2018 pattern?  Many analysts disagree on whether the current tax changes will lead to a repeat of the 2018 market pattern. According to Neelkanth Mishra, Chief Economist at Axis Bank, the new tax framework aims to stabilize savings and won't significantly deter investors. He told Moneycontrol that even Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) won't be majorly affected, as attractive returns over the next three to five years will outweigh a minor reduction in returns. Although there was a temporary FII sell-off following the announcement, Mishra believes it won't have a lasting impact. The adjustments to capital gains tax aim to reduce distortions caused by varying tax rates across different asset classes. Rajesh Palvia, an analyst at Axis Securities, said market dynamics have changed since 2018. Back then, options had only monthly expiries, leading to higher premiums and a greater cost impact due to STT on premiums. Now, with weekly expiries, premiums are about one-fourth of what they were, reducing the impact of STT. Although profitability is lower with weekly expiries, the overall dynamics have shifted. Palvia doesn't expect the same market reaction as in 2018 solely due to capital gains tax changes. While LTCG and STCG could cause market corrections, STT won't have as much impact. Volumes may dry up when STT is applied in October, but if the market remains bullish, volumes could pick up again. Several analysts highlight that the highly anticipated post-election budget has passed. India remains one of the world's fastest-growing economies, with strong macroeconomic indicators, easing inflation, favorable monsoons, and robust growth. The government's fiscal discipline will encourage private investment. Emphasizing private capital expenditure (capex), the capex cycle stands to benefit from deleveraged corporate balance sheets, healthy profitability, rising domestic demand, and increasing capacity utilization. Although capex expenditure is unchanged from the interim budget, it shows a healthy 17 percent year-over-year growth. Tax benefits for the salaried class, focus on employment generation, and ongoing policies for housing and rural reforms (agriculture/allied sectors) are likely to positively impact consumption. Companies experiencing growth are now seeing high multiples, while those with low multiples have not yet delivered growth. Thus, short-term returns may be muted, but the long-term growth potential of the Indian equity market remains positive, analysts added. Gaurav Dua, SVP and Head of Capital Market Strategy at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, stated that Nifty is expected to remain stable without any sharp declines, though a 3-4 percent correction is possible annually. He noted that the risk-reward ratio for small-cap, mid-cap, and micro-cap stocks has become unfavorable, posing higher risks. Over the next 12 to 18 months, lagging sectors like IT services, pharma, services, and select stocks in consumer and specialty chemicals are expected to lead and outperform the index.

Should the Budget have set a higher capex target?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/should-the-budget-have-set-a-higher-capex-target-12777301.html,Market,"July 24, 2024 05:28 PM","The final budget while optically keeping its capex for FY25 unchanged at Rs 11.1 lakh crore, has many facets wherein the capex has actually increased. Before that, we need to understand that the interim capex outlay itself is a 17 percent YoY increase versus FY24. Such a large increase in capex is notable. Therefore, the need for further increase is not warranted within three months. It is necessary to understand that the final budget should be looked as an increment rather than an absolute. However, the final budget does present several areas of capex thrust. First, within an increased revenue spending the allocation is for increased support for states for capex (especially Andhra Pradesh & Bihar) for infrastructure projects, renewable energy, urban development, and affordable housing which in aggregate is over Rs 40,000 crore. The allocation to Andhra Pradesh and Bihar noticeably is for large projects with funding planned from external sources in addition to central government budget support. This should augment budgeted spend. Next, additional allocation from PSU capex largely HUDCO which is again for urban development is over Rs 25,000 crore. The aggregate capex spend to GDP therefore rise to 4.5 percent versus 4.3 percent in the interim budget including PSU capex. This ratio is perhaps the highest so far in the decade. This has to be looked in context of moderating revenue expenditure and focus on fiscal consolidation as well. Noticeably, fiscal consolidation is coming without any growth sacrifice which is a huge positive for growth and consolidation. Furthermore, the additional grants for employment support for youth (Rs 10,000 crore), and the target schemes for MSME and manufacturing via credit support and credit guarantee is also aimed to spur private capex. There are several announcements in the budget that are capex oriented – to name a few viz. infrastructure parks, shipping, critical mineral mission, digital public infrastructure, IBC reforms, transit development plan for large cities, creative development of cities, street markets, policies for energy security are aimed at public-private partnership for medium to long term investment. In addition, efforts aimed to simplify tax regime and increase confidence among taxpayers will go a long way in the ease of doing business. Rationalising tax structure and increasing the slab rates within the new tax regime of income tax will help boost consumption. In summary, capex need not be explicit all the time. This budget has more than many ways for a large implicit capex boost. In summary, India is not shying away from capex, but rather setting the stage for structural capex trends. The stage is set for structural long-term growth and rating upgrades down the road!

The consolidated order book of the group was at Rs 4,90,881 crore as on June 30, 2024, with international orders having a share of 38 percent, L&T said. The order book of Rs 4,75,809 crore represents a growth of 19 percent over Rs 4,12,648 crore as on June 30, 2023 and Rs 3,63,448 crore as on June 30, 2022, the company said. OUTLOOK Going forward, L&T expects India's economic growth momentum to continue in the medium term facilitated by both public and private capital investment. ""With the Union Elections behind and the likely political stability, the Government’s continued thrust on capex and business optimism augur well for investment activity.,"" the company said in a stock exchange filing. However, despite the strong growth momentum expected domestically, L&T expects a slowdown in the pace of infrastructure progress due to skilled labour shortage in certain sectors. L&T added that it expects a rebound in international orders though the run-up to the US Presidential elections in November can exhibit economic volatility. ""With the change of Government in UK, and a hung parliament in France, the concern about the European economic recovery remains. China’s economic recovery remains debatable with rising trade tensions threatening to overshadow growth in exports,"" L&T added. L&T Chairman and Managing Director SN Subrahmanyan said that the Union Budget released yesterday presented a detailed roadmap towards pursuit of a Viksit Bharat by 2047. ""With the expected policy continuation in India, the tailwinds in the Indian economic growth is likely to continue which will facilitate the Group to achieve its Lakshya 26 targets,"" Subrahmanyan said. He added that L&T has achieved steady growth across all financial parameters in Q1 FY 2024-25, despite the geopolitical situation across the globe. ""Amidst various transformational shifts happening worldwide, we are well-positioned to grasp these opportunities with our expertise in our traditional P&M business and technology driven new-age businesses,"" Subrahmanyan added. Back in May 2024 L&T had said it will aim for a 10 percent on-year growth in its order inflows and a topline growth of 15 percent on year in the financial year 2024-25. L&T's management had said that going forward it expects private order to continue to make up around 25 percent of L&T's order book. At the start of 2023-24, L&T's management had said that they expect the engineering major's revenue to grow at 12-15 percent and order intake growth at 10-12 percent in 2023-24. L&T ended 2023-24 with topline growth of 21 percent at Rs 2.21 lakh crore from Rs. nearly Rs 1.83 lakh crore last year. Similarly, the company's order inflow during FY24 stood at Rs 3 lakh crore, up 31 percent when compared with an order inflow of Rs 2.3 lakh crore seen in FY23. Infrastructure Projects Segment Segment-wise, L&T’s infrastructure projects segment secured order inflows of Rs 40,053 crore, during the quarter that ended June 30, 2024, which was slightly higher than order worth Rs 40,051 crore secured in the same period last year. The segment order book stood at Rs 324,879 crore as of June 30, 2024, with the share of international orders at 28 percent. The segment order book stood at Rs 311,665 crore as of March 31, 2024. Revenues from the segment rose 21.4 percent on year to Rs 27,179.45 crore while profit from the segment rose 41.2 percent on year to Rs 1,200.09 crore. The rise in profit was mainly on account of a rise in operating profit margin from the segment which rose to 5.8 percent in Q1FY25 from 5.1 percent in the same period a year ago. L&T's infrastructure projects segment had seen a sequential fall in operating margins for the seven quarters as the company won infrastructure projects at very aggressive prices after the post-COVID-19, post-Russia-Ukraine (conflict) period in 2022-23. The company's chief financial officer R Shankar Raman Raman said that L&T expects its operating margin to start improving from the next financial year as orders won at aggressive prices in 2022-23 will complete execution and new orders start being carried out. At the end of June 2023, around 35-40 percent of L&T's then order book of Rs 3,01,159 crore from the infrastructure projects segment was made up of orders that were won at aggressive prices. Energy Projects Segment L&T secured order inflows of Rs 8,792 crore in this segment, during the quarter that ended June 30, 2024, which was nearly 21 percent higher when compared to the corresponding quarter of the previous year. Energy Projects' Segment order book stood at Rs 117,724  crore as on June 30, 2024, with the international order book constituting 76 percent. Revenues from the segment rose 27 percent on year to Rs 8500.37 crore while profit from the segment rose 20.1 percent on year to Rs 669.15 crore. The EBITDA margin of the segment came in at 8.7 percent for the quarter that ended June 30, 2024, slight lower than the 9.1 percent over the corresponding quarter of the previous year, mainly on account of job savings in hydrocarbon and customer claim settlements in the powerbusiness. Hi-Tech Manufacturing Segment L&T secured order inflows of Rs 3,677 crore in this segment, during the quarter that ended June 30, 2024, which was three times higher when compared to the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The Hi-Tech Manufacturing Segment order book stood at Rs 33,765 crore as of June 30, 2024, with the international order book constituting 7 percent. Shankar Raman said that order inflow in the company's Hi-Tech Manufacturing segment has been slow in the first half of FY24 due to the delays in the government awarding defense contracts. ""Going forward we expect the government to aggressively come out with defense orders which will help order inflow of our Hi-Tech Manufacturing segment,"" Shankar Raman said. Revenues from the segment fell 2.5 percent on year to Rs 1919.72 crore while profit from the segment rose 5 percent on year to Rs 266.91 crore. The EBITDA margin for the segment was at 17.4 percent for the quarter as compared to 16.8 percent in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. IT & Technology Services Segment L&T's revenues from this segment rose to Rs 11556.74 crore during the quarter that ended June 30, 2024, which was 5.4 percent higher when compared to the corresponding quarter of the previous year. International billing contributed 92 percent of the total customer revenues of the segment. Profit from the segment fell 0.3 percent on the year to Rs 1911.46 crore. The EBITDA margin for the segment was at 20 percent for the quarter as compared to 20.6 percent in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The segment margin fell due to lower utilization levels in LTIMindtree.

"Changes in STT, LTCG, STCG will be forgotten quickly, focus to shift on US Presidential election",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/changes-in-stt-ltcg-stcg-will-be-forgotten-quickly-focus-to-shift-on-us-presidential-election-12777257.html,Market,"July 24, 2024 05:16 PM","Changes as envisaged in the Budget by the finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG) and Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) does not fundamentally impact the pricing of the stocks. The price of the stock is determined by various other factors like topline, net profit, earnings level and such other accounting related matters. From the valuation perspective, the change in STCG or LTCG is not a determining factor in pricing of the stock but yes, the change in these tax structure will have a negative impact on the market sentiment. Market doesn’t like negative surprises. The change in rate structure was a negative surprise for the market to an extent that the marginal hike in tax rates has become a mood spoiler. The only impact it will have is sentimental in nature and not economical/fundamental in nature. One may argue that the hike in LTCG from 10 percent to 12.5 percent is a hike of 25 percent, but if you see the overall scheme of the things, it is just a marginal. If an investor has LTCG of Rs 1 Lakh earlier, he had to pay Rs 10,000 in tax but now onwards he will have to pay Rs 12,500, fishing out additional Rs 2,500. I will call it as a sentimental impact and consider it as sentimental negative. As far as STCG is concerned, it will impact the short-term trading behaviour of the investor and will reduce the horizon of the investor to look at the market from the short-term point of view. According to me, this is a step in the right direction. Now the STCG rates have been increased from 15 percent to 20 percent. Investors will be disincentivised to invest in short term and will be incentivised to stay invested for a longer period of time. The arbitrage between the STCG and LTCG has gone up. Initially, the STCG was 15 percent and the LTCG was 10 percent with a arbitrage of 5 percent but now with the rates being hiked, the arbitrage has gone up to 7.5 percent. With these changes, the Government has sent signals to the market that it wants investors to stay in the market with a longer-term horizon and discourage those investors having short-term view on the market. I think this move by the Government is in favour of market, capital formation and for overall stability of the market. As far as changes in Securities Transaction Tax (STT) is concerned, it was on expected lines as the Economic Survey presented on Monday had raised concerns related to the Futures & Options (F&O) trading and already indicated some action on this front. The government has used hike in STT as a tool to rein in the excessive that it felt were present in the F&O segment. The STT has gone up by 60 percent and there will be some impact on the trading volume in the segment. Again, there is no change in the fundamentals of the businesses here as well but we expect the volumes in the Derivatives may go down by 10-15 percent because of these changes. Whatever be the impact of these changes in the tax structure, the market is going to forget this budget in next two-three days. From the beginning of the August, entire focus of the market will move towards the largest event, that is lined up at the end of this calendar year, the US Presidential election. Two parties participating in the US election; the Democrats and the Republicans have diverse thought process on issues ranging like the direction of the US economy, the direction of Global relationships, Tariffs etc. A lot of things will change depending on whether the Democrats retain the power or Republican succeeds in ousting the incumbent Government. Markets will be keenly watching these events and it will rotate and prepare itself in the direction in which it seems the outcome is going.

STT on F&O: Breaking down cost impact per contract on Index futures and options,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/stt-on-fo-breaking-down-cost-impact-per-contract-on-index-options-12777234.html,Market,"July 24, 2024 05:19 PM","The Budget proposal to hike securities transaction tax on derivatives trades has got market participants worked up. The consternation is understandable, as STT has to be paid irrespective of whether the trade results in a profit or loss. A higher STT means the breakeven threshold for a derivatives trade has increased. STT on the sale of an option in securities has been raised from 0.0625 percent to 0.1 percent of the option premium, and on the sale of futures in securities from 0.0125 percent to 0.02 percent of the price at which such futures are traded. We decode the cost impact of this rise in STT on index futures and some Nifty 50 stock index options. Calculations show that the STT on the sale of one lot of Nifty Futures is approximately Rs 77 at the old rates. With the revised STT, this would be Rs 123, an increase of Rs 46. For Bank Nifty futures, the net increase in cost impact is Rs 57. Futures of the Sensex, Finnifty, and Midcap Nifty indexes, which had approximate STT costs of Rs 100, 72, and 77 per lot on sale, will now have new STT charges of Rs 160, 115, and 123, respectively. Also read: Hike in STT on F&O trades a dampener, impact to be felt with a lag, say traders The table below shows the new STT charges across index and Nifty 50 stock futures and the potential cost impact:   Sheersham Gupta, Director and senior technical analyst at Rupeezy says the hike will have varying effects on these trades. ""Notably, the sale of futures contracts will experience a significant increase in STT, with an average rise of Rs 40-60 for index and stock futures. This could shift trader behaviour towards more positional trading and reduce intraday and scalping activities,” he said. “In contrast, the STT hike has a minimal impact on options trading since it is levied on the option premium, making it less likely to deter options traders,” he added. Gupta, however, notes that the overall impact on market liquidity remains to be seen once the revised STT kicks in from October 1. The regulatory measure comes into effect after SEBI's study showed a growing loss of wealth among retail participants in F&O trading. According to the study, nine out of ten individual traders in the equity derivatives segment incurred losses in FY22, up from 87 percent in FY19. Another study released by SEBI today on July 24 shows that more than 70 percent (7 out of 10) of individual intraday traders in equity cash segment have incurred losses in FY 2022-23. The study also noted the surge of over 300 percent in the number of individuals participating in intraday trading in equity cash segment in FY 2022-23 compared to FY 2018-19.

"Technical View: Bulls find support as VIX hits 3-month low, Nifty likely to climb above 24,600",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/technical-view-bulls-find-support-as-vix-hits-3-month-low-nifty-likely-to-climb-above-24600-12777220.html,Market,"July 24, 2024 04:33 PM","The Nifty 50 smartly defended the 24,300 as well as the 24,400 levels amid volatility on a closing basis, while trading within the previous day's range during the day on July 24, ahead of the monthly F&O expiry session tomorrow. The index seems to have digested the budget and is looking for cues from corporate earnings and global markets. As long as the index defends these levels along with VIX at a multi-month low, it may move towards the immediate hurdle of 24,600 in the coming sessions. Above that, the 24,855 all-time high can't be ruled out, although momentum indicators remained negative, according to experts. The Nifty 50 opened lower at 24,445 and remained ranged during the day. The index closed 66 points down to 24,414 with above-average volumes, continuing a downtrend for the fourth consecutive session after hitting a record high. It has formed a bearish candlestick pattern with a long lower shadow and a minor upper shadow on the daily charts, indicating volatile trade. ""Now the index has to hold 24,400 zones for an up move towards 24,600 and 24,750 zones, whereas supports are placed at 24,300 and then 24,200 levels,"" said Chandan Taparia, Senior Vice President | Analyst-Derivatives at Motilal Oswal Financial Services. According to the monthly options data, the maximum Call open interest was observed at the 25,000 strike, followed by the 24,800, 24,500, and 24,600 strikes, with maximum Call writing at the 25,000 strike, and then the 24,400 and 24,800 strikes. On the Put side, the 24,000 strike holds the maximum open interest, followed by the 23,500 and 23,800 strikes, with maximum writing at the 24,000 strike, and then the 24,100 and 23,500 strikes. The above options data suggests that the Nifty is expected to face a hurdle at the 24,500-24,800 zone on the higher side before making a strong move towards the much-awaited 25,000, which looks possible in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, 24,100 and 24,000 are the crucial support levels. Bank Nifty The Bank Nifty extended its downfall following the budget, falling 461 points or 0.9 percent to 51,317 amid volatility and continuing the lower high-lower low formation with high volumes on the monthly F&O expiry day. However, it defended the 50-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average 50,942) on a closing basis. The sentiment might remain weak as it closed below its support level of 51,700 and its 21-day exponential moving average, Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities said. Hence, according to him, a sell-on-rise approach might favour traders until the index closes above 52,000. ""The support is placed at 50,900, where the 50-day EMA lies. On the other hand, resistance is seen at 51,550 and 52,000,"" Rupak said. Meanwhile, the further decline in volatility suggested that the bulls may not have major pressure from bears. The India VIX, the fear index, dropped 7.73 percent to 11.76, the lowest closing level since April 26 this year. It has also decisively broken down the upward sloping support trendline, which is favourable for bulls.

As a result of packages and measures by the government, BSNL/MTNL have started earning operating profits from FY 2020-21, Minister of State for Communications Pemmasani Chandra Sekhar said in a written reply in the Lok Sabha. In line with the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, BSNL has placed a purchase order for 1 lakh 4G sites for deployment of indigenous 4G technology, Sekhar said, adding that the equipment is upgradable to 5G. According to the details of last five years' performance of BSNL shared by the Minister, EBITDA stood at Rs 2,164 crore in FY24, 38.8 per cent more than a year ago. The loss narrowed to Rs 5,371 crore in FY24, from Rs 8,161 crore in FY23. To another question on data breach in BSNL, the Minister said Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) reported possible intrusion and data breach at BSNL on May 20, 2024. ""The same was analysed and found that one File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server was having the data similar to the sample data shared by CERT-In. No breach into the Home Location Register (HLR) of the telecom network has been reported by the equipment manufacturer, hence no service outage in BSNL's network,"" he said. However, as a remedial measure to prevent such probable breach, BSNL has taken steps, and access passwords to all similar FTP servers have been changed. ""Further, an Inter Ministerial Committee (IMC) has been constituted to conduct an audit of the telecom networks and suggest remedial measures for prevention of data breaches in the Telecom networks,"" Sekhar said. The Minister further said that the government has taken various steps for the revival of BSNL and MTNL. In 2019, the first revival package amounting to around Rs 69,000 crore brought down the operating costs of BSNL/MTNL. In 2022, a revival package amounting to around Rs 1.64 lakh crore was given. It focused on infusing fresh capital, restructuring debt, viability gap funding for rural telephony among others. In 2023, the government approved the allotment of 4G/5G spectrum to BSNL with a total outlay of around Rs 89,000 crore.

"Hike in capital gains tax only a temporary concern, say MF players",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hike-in-capital-gains-tax-only-a-temporary-concern-say-mf-players-12777237.html,Market,"July 24, 2024 04:29 PM","The government’s decision to hike tax on both, long-term capital gains and short-term capital gains, took the mutual fund industry by surprise though industry participants are unanimous in saying that this is only a temporary concern and will not have any serious impact on the investors. While presenting the Union Budget on July 24, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed increasing the tax on LTCG from 10 percent to 12.5 percent while increasing the STCG from 15 percent to 20 percent. More importantly, the exemption limit for capital gains on certain financial assets has been increased to Rs 1.25 lakh per year, which, according to the government, will benefit lower and middle-income groups. Venkat Chalasani, Chief Executive, Association of Mutual Funds (AMFI) is of the view that the increase in exemption limit for LTCG tax is a welcome change. “While the changes in rates for Long Term Capital Gain (LTCG) and Short Term Capital Gain (STCG) were not anticipated, the markets will take them in their stride,” he said. Incidentally, AMFI, in a pre-budget note, had suggested that the LTCG on listed equity shares or units of equity-oriented fund schemes, held for more than one year and up to three years be subjected to tax at the rate of 10 percent on capital gains exceeding Rs 2 lakh in a financial year. Additionally, they had hoped for gains from such assets (if held more than three years) to be exempted from capital gains tax. Post the announcement in an interaction with CNBC-TV18, TV Somanathan, Secretary, Finance defended this move, stating that the move was a positive and would benefit both government and taxpayers. Short-term fears, long-term benefit Trideep Bhattacharya, CIO-Equity, Edelweiss MF told Moneycontrol that the announcement of an increase in the long-term capital gains tax from 10 percent to 12.5 percent represents only a small incremental increase for investors. For a two-year holding period, investors will see an impact of 1.25 percent (on the total returns), he says. “Generally, the holding period for investors is between 3 to 5 years. If we consider a 5-year holding period, the impact would be around 2.5 percent, or 50 basis points per annum. This marginal decrease does not significantly affect the liquidity of the equity market, as investors typically seek returns that are much higher than this. The 50 basis points per annum is relatively minor and does not materially alter investment decisions,” explains Bhattacharya. Another benefit, according to Bhattacharya, is the rationalisation of the tax rate across different asset classes, such as equities and real estate, to a uniform 12.5 percent. This eliminates previous arbitrage opportunities and could make equities a more attractive asset class, potentially leading to increased inflows from investors shifting funds from other assets. ""The consistent tax policy also removes uncertainty and overhang about future tax increases, which had been a concern in previous budget announcements,"" he says. Meanwhile Mayukh Datta, CBO at ITI Mutual Fund, highlights the fact that while the changes have been announced for equity funds, debt funds have not seen any changes and continued to be taxed in the same way. One aspect, he notes that is missing from the discussion, is hybrid schemes, particularly those with less than 65 percent in equities and more than 35 percent in debt where the long-term capital gains tax has decreased from 20 percent with indexation to 12.5 percent without indexation. “Additionally, the holding period to qualify for long-term gains has been reduced from 36 months to 24 months for these assets. This change is significant as it applies to various asset classes, including property,” he says. The increase in exemption limit for long-term capital gains, experts say, could benefit small investors and encourage them to invest in equities. Vinit Sambre, Head of Equity at DSP Mutual Fund, told Moneycontrol that at the end of the day investors will likely still focus on high-yielding assets for long-term outperformance. “With uniform taxation across asset classes, the key consideration will be the long-term returns generated by each asset class. From this perspective, the change is not expected to have a significant negative impact (for the mutual fund industry),” he said. Datta concurs, adding that the increase in capital gains tax does not significantly alter investment decisions for most people, as taxes are generally not the primary factor influencing such decisions. He adds that in India, capital gains tax is only applied when gains are realized, unlike in some other countries where taxes are applied to notional gains. Therefore, the impact of the increased tax is only felt upon exiting an investment.

Cipla Q1 Preview: Domestic business restructuring may moderate profit growth,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/cipla-q1-preview-domestic-business-restructuring-may-moderate-profit-growth-12777086.html,Market,"July 24, 2024 04:26 PM","Drugmaker Cipla Ltd is all set to release its results for the April-June quarter of FY25 on July 26. While US sales are likely to remain steady, a restructuring of the domestic business is expected to moderate the drugmaker's growth momentum. According to a Moneycontrol poll of nine brokerages, Cipla's revenue is estimated to grow a little over 7 percent to Rs 6,788 crore in Q1FY25, up from Rs 6,329 crore recorded in the same quarter of the previous fiscal. Net profit growth is expected to moderate to 12 percent at Rs 1,116 crore as against Rs 996 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. For context, the drugmaker clocked in profit growth of over 30 percent across all quarters in FY24.  Brokerages on the Street are largely along the same lines when it comes to profit growth expectations for Cipla, with the most optimistic ones predicting around 12 percent on year growth and the most pessimists anticipating a 6 percent increase. Among brokerages, Sharekhan has forecast the strongest profit growth for Cipla, backed by expectations of a pick up in domestic branded market. In contrast, Kotak Institutional Equities, which projected the weakest growth estimates, anticipates the bottomline to be impacted due to a change in Cipla's distribution model, undertaken in the trade generics segment. What factors are driving the earnings? While the drugmaker's US sales are likely to be steady, backed by contribution from the blockbuster cancer drug Revlimid and a ramp-up of other launches, the restructuring of the domestic trade generics segment is expected to dent earnings growth. However, the management is optimistic about mitigating the adverse impact in the coming quarters. Business restructuring: The Indian pharma market saw recovery in the first quarter of the current fiscal, after a slowdown in demand during the previous quarter. While that is a positive sign for Cipla's domestic sales, the recent changes in the trade generics business model is expected to offset its positive impact. Brokerage firm Nomura anticipates low single-digit sales growth in the domestic market for Cipla, impacted by disruption in trade generics due to the restructuring, which can lead to inventory drawdowns. Regardless, the management is not too worried as it stated in a previous earnings call that the sales impacted due to the disruption will be eventually recovered in the rest of the fiscal. Steady US sales: Despite some weakness in domestic sales, the steady performance in the US market is expected to come to the rescue for Cipla yet again in Q1. The drugmaker's US sales are likely to remain consistent, supported by Revlimid contribution, and new launches like  hormone drug Lanreotide, Prabhudas Lilladher said. Kotak Institutional Equities also estimates Revlimid sales to rise marginally to $28 million, slightly higher than $25 million in the past quarter. Lower trade generics contribution: The restructuring of the domestic trade generic business, which is expected to impact revenue adversely, is also likely to weigh on Cipla's profitability. Accordingly, the poll of seven brokerages estimates Cipla's EBITDA margin at 24.2 percent in Q1, slightly lower than the management's guidance of 24.5-25.5 percent. What to look out for in the quarterly show? Analysts and investors will be on the watch out for the management's commentary over the regulatory actions on the company's key manufacturing units. Along those lines, investors will also be anticipating more clarity about the estimated launch timeline for key drugs like Advair and Albuterol, to see if the USFDA regulatory actions have caused a further delay in these launches.

According to the average of 10 estimates compiled by Moneycontrol, Tech Mahindra's net profit is projected to increase over 30 percent quarter-over-quarter, reaching Rs 861 crore in Q1 FY25. Revenue from operations is expected to rise 0.8 percent QoQ to Rs 12,968 crore on the reversal of furloughs of the March quarter and stabilisation of the mortgage business. The growth, however, could be impacted marginally due to seasonal softness in its subsidiary-Comviva-a mobile application firm acquired from Bharti Group by Tech Mahindra in 2012.  Tech Mahindra Q1 FY25 Preview The EBIT margin is anticipated to improve by 60 basis points to 8 percent, reflecting the company’s operational efficiencies and cost control measures. Tech Mahindra's net profit for Q4 FY24 fell 40.9 percent YoY to Rs 661 crores, due to slowdowns in telecom, communications, media, and entertainment sectors. What factors are driving the earnings? 1.

Rupee falls 1 paisa to revisit all-time low of 83.70 against US dollar,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/rupee-falls-1-paisa-to-revisit-all-time-low-of-83-70-against-us-dollar-12777238.html,Market,"July 24, 2024 04:15 PM","The rupee depreciated 1 paisa to revisit its all-time closing low of 83.70 (provisional) against the US dollar on Wednesday, weighed down by a strong dollar against major crosses overseas amid investors' weak appetite for riskier assets. Forex traders said the increase in capital gains tax and removal of indexation benefits announced in the FY25 Budget on Tuesday was the main reason for dollar buying as foreign investors sold stocks. At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local unit opened at 83.69 and touched an intra-day high of 83.68 and a low of 83.72 against the dollar during the session. It finally settled at an all-time low level of 83.70 (provisional) against the American currency, registering a fall of 1 paisa from its previous close. On Tuesday, the rupee declined 3 paise to 83.69 against the US dollar after the government raised tax rates on capital gains in the FY25 Budget. Forex traders said US dollar buying continued to be the theme after the increase in long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) and short-term capital gains tax (STCG) and then the removal of indexation benefits. The government on Tuesday proposed reducing the long-term capital gains tax on immovable properties to 12.5 per cent from 20 per cent but removed the indexation benefits to adjust for inflation, a move experts termed as ""negative"" for sellers. As per the memorandum to the Union Budget, with rationalisation of rate to 12.5 per cent, indexation available under section 48 of the Income Tax Act is proposed to be removed for calculation of any long-term capital gains, which is presently available for property, gold and other unlisted assets. Meanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, was trading higher by 0.05 per cent at 104.50. Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, were trading higher by 0.79 per cent at USD 81.65 per barrel. In the domestic equity market, the 30-share BSE Sensex fell 280.16 points or 0.35 per cent to settle at 80,148.88 points, and Nifty dropped 65.55 points or 0.27 per cent to 24,413.50 points.

Shares of Macrotech Developers were up 1.1 percent, Sobha up 3.1 percent, Prestige Estates up 5.4 percent, Ajmera Realty up 2.8 percent, DLF up 2 percent and Oberoi Realty up 3.4 percent. The indexation benefit adjusts the asset’s purchase price for inflation. At the time of sale, this results in a higher purchase price and a lower capital gain, potentially reducing the tax liability or even eliminating it. Without indexation, the gain is calculated on the actual purchase price, likely leading to higher taxes. Following the proposal, realty stocks witnessed strong selling on July 23, with major names like Godrej Properties and Prestige Estates slumping as much as 5 percent intraday. However, to ease the increased tax burden and rationalise the capital gains tax regime, the finance minister also changed the LTCG tax rate to 12.5 percent across all financial and non-financial assets. This would result in the LTCG tax on property falling from 20 percent earlier. Follow our live blog for all the updates Market and industry participants still remain skeptical of the proposal while some like S Naren, CIO of ICICI Prudential, welcome the decision. ""Government steps to aid asset allocation like removal of indexation should increase transaction volumes,"" Naren said in an interaction with CNBC-TV18. On the other hand, analysts at CLSA's suggest that the change will affect short-term investments with market price growth of less than 10 percent. ""However, for investments held for over ten years with property price appreciation exceeding 10 percent per annum, the impact of the new regime would be neutral or slightly beneficial,"" CLSA added.

The deflation in certain commodities, coupled with price hikes and improved operating leverage shall support the staples giant’s margins and bottomline. According to a Moneycontrol poll of eight brokerages, Nestle is likely to report an eight percent jump in revenue at Rs 5,060 crore compared to Rs 4,659 crore reported in the same quarter last year. Net profit is likely to surge 14 percent to Rs 789 crore in the June quarter, from Rs 698 crore from the corresponding quarter during the previous fiscal year.  Earnings estimates of analysts polled by Moneycontrol are in a narrow range, so any positive or negative surprises may elicit a sharp reaction in the stock. The most optimistic estimate sees Nestle India’s net profit jumping 17 percent on-year, but the most pessimistic projection suggests that net profit will rise seven percent. What factors are impacting the earnings? Nestle India’s revenue is expected to grow 9 percent led by price hikes, rural-led distribution expansion and new product development, noted Axis Securities. Commodity prices: Nestle India’s EBITDA margin is expected to expand from 22.8 percent in Q1FY24 as a result of deflation in palm oil and milk prices. The company also passed on raw material inflation to the consumers, bumping up the price of chocolates and coffee. Segment performance: Brokerages are mixed on out-of-home products. While Kotak expects the segment to increase its contribution to the topline, Prabhudas Lilladher said, “OOH products had a setback due to heatwaves in many parts of the country whereas beverages did well due to intense summers. Volume growth: Kotak noted that volume (tonnage) growth might come in at 5 percent, which is largely in line with the previous quarter.

IT companies' buybacks might lose appeal after Budget shifts tax burden to investors,https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/it-companies-buybacks-might-lose-appeal-after-budget-shifts-tax-burden-to-investors-article-12776830.html,Market,"July 24, 2024 01:04 PM","Buybacks from information technology (IT) companies might lose their appeal following the Budget 2023-24 announcement that income from the buyback of shares will be chargeable to the recipient investor as a dividend. Analysts predict this change will make buybacks less attractive to investors because of the compliance burden and possibly higher taxes. The current regime states that buyback will be charged as an additional income tax in the hands of the company. Now, payment from the buyback of shares shall be charged to income tax at applicable rates, come October 1, 2024. “So I think overall for an investor in India, this will have implications for IT companies. They are creating hurdles from both a tax perspective and a compliance perspective,"" said Pareekh Jain, Founder and CEO, EIIRTrend. Top IT companies have bought back shares worth over 1 lakh crore in the last five years in at least 12 buybacks between 2020 and 2024, according to data.  Jain highlighted that the intention behind this move seems to be aimed at curbing speculative investment. However, he noted that this could also hurt genuine investors. ""Earlier it was hurdle-free for investors, now they have to consider all these implications. Dividend income is taxed at a higher rate compared to capital gains, too. These are unnecessary complications.” The government explained the rationale behind the move, stating in the Budget memorandum that both dividends and buybacks should be treated similarly as they are methods for the company to distribute accumulated reserves. At present, investors pay long-term capital gains (LTCG) and short-term capital gains tax (STCG) on the sale of shares, depending on the holding period. Holding period of 12 months attracts LTCG tax while anything less than that would attract STCG. The Budget, with effect from July 23, has increased LTCG to 12.5 percent from 10 percent while also increasing the short-term capital gains tax from the current 15 percent to 20 percent. The increase in tax on both long-term and short-term capital gains is a bit disappointing and could have been avoided, Sanjay Sanghvi, Partner, Khaitan & Co, told Moneycontrol. Institutional investors manage to handle the compliance burden and cash flow issues, but retail investors can’t afford a tax compliance team, says Sujith Kumar A, founder, of CFINANCIO Consulting. “Many retail investors are not aware of the tax regulations, which opens up the scope for non-compliance.” The IT industry, known for its significant contribution to India's exports, may see a decline in buyback activities as investors might grapple with the new tax burden, experts said. As analysts and investors navigate these new regulations, the full impact on the sector remains to be seen. Also read: LTCG rejig – making asset classes, other than equities, attractive? ",NEGATIVE

"Bullish on banks, pharma  says I-Pru MF's S Naren",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/bullish-on-banks-pharma-says-i-pru-mfs-s-naren-12776392.html,Market,"July 24, 2024 12:24 PM","“There is nothing wrong with banks at this point in time,” said S. Naren, Chief Investment Officer at ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, in a conversation with Moneycontrol. Banking stocks were the rage for much of 2023 as the sector benefitted from a strong credit cycle and better net interest margin during the initial period of rising interest rates. However, the struggle to raise low cost deposits and the plateauing of credit demand has tempered the sentiment for banking stocks over the last couple of quarters. In 2024 so far, the Nifty Bank index has risen 5.8 percent, compared to a 12.12 percent rise in the 50-share Nifty index. “The banking sector has underperformed in recent years, but as firm believers in mean reversion, we see potential in this sector moving forward,” Naren added. Naren is also optimistic about the pharmaceutical sector, citing a favourable U.S. generic drug cycle and reasonable valuations . Life insurance is another sector where Naren currently sees promise. Even with a slew of announcements indirectly benefiting the FMCG segment, Naren said that he is not so sure about the segment emerging as a theme post-budget because the valuations in the segment are pretty expensive right now. On the hike in Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on derivative trades, Naren said that if the announcement was so significant, the market would have reacted in a different way today. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman during her Budget 2024 sought to curb the incessantly rising futures & options (F&O) trading in India by proposing to hike the securities transaction tax (STT) on Futures & Options trading. The STT on sale of equity options will now be levied at 0.1 percent of the option premium, up from 0.0625 percent; and at the rate of 0.02 percent on sale of futures as against 0.0125 percent now.

"Titan, ITC seen benefitting most from consumption thrust in Budget 2024",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/titan-itc-seen-benefitting-most-from-consumption-thrust-in-budget-2024-12776742.html,Market,"July 24, 2024 11:46 AM","The Budget had more negative surprises than positive ones for the stock market, but investors in specific stocks have something to cheer about. According to analysts tracking consumer stocks, ITC and Titan are expected to benefit from some of the measures announced in the Budget. Why Titan? In the budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed to cut the customs duty on gold and silver from ten percent to six percent. Adding 5 percent AIDC or Agriculture Infrastructure and Development Cess, which remains unchanged, the total import duty on gold and silver has reduced from 15 percent to 11 percent. Also Read | Post-budget, high-quality stocks expected to yield steady returns The reduction in gold customs should improve Titan’s growth outlook, noted Macquarie. The brokerage raised its FY26/27E EPS by one/two percent on the Rakesh Jhunjhunwala stock to factor in the customs duty cut. Domestic brokerage Emkay Global concurred, saying that the duty cut-led moderation in gold prices will catalyze customers who have been on the fence as a result of the spike in gold prices. While Titan might see a moderate Q1 due to a spike in gold price, lesser wedding days, and election-related operating challenges, the second half of this financial year is expected to be better because of the duty cut and better operating environment. A likely accelerated shift of consumers towards the organized sector, moving away from the local players makes a strong case for valuation re-rating, Emkay added. Why ITC? An age-old adage says no news is good news. No changes, updates or hikes in excise duty or NCCD (National Calamity Contingent Duty) are good news for the tobacco sector, especially India’s largest player: ITC. Morgan Stanley said the Budget allayed one of the key concerns of tobacco tax hikes. ITC is extremely well-placed for sustainable growth, with strong business fundamentals. According to the brokerage, ITC is likely a re-rating play. Jefferies India upgraded ITC to a buy rating, raising the target price to Rs 585 per share, foreseeing a 25 percent upside. The last tobacco tax hike was 2 percent in February 2023. This stability allows ITC to focus on volume with minimal price hikes, Jefferies said. The brokerage further noted that GST taxes are expected to remain stable until March 2026 as the Centre settles state dues. Improving demand in the staple sector should benefit ITC's key businesses. The February 2025 Budget will be significant, but a modest price hike this year will lay the groundwork for next year. About 90 percent of cigarette taxes fall under the GST regime (GST rate at 28 percent + compensation cess), earmarked until March 2026, to repay state borrowings, ensuring tax stability for the next 12-18 months. Additionally, the outlook for the consumer staples sector is improving, which shall be a net positive for ITC as well.

In an order dated July 23, the insurance regulatory authority said that the issuance of stock options of the company to Saluja in her capacity as the executive chairperson of Religare Enterprises Limited (REL) is a violation of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority Act, 1999, and circulars, guidelines and directions issued thereunder. Also read: Religare Enterprises refutes allegations against Rashmi Saluja, investors book profit post rally The order asked CHIL to buyback 75,69,685 shares allotted to Saluja at the same price per share on the exercise price (Rs 45.32 per share) within 30 days and to cancel unexercised or unvested stock options within 15 days. It also stated that to secure the proper management of CHIL from the date of the order, any decision made by the board of the firm in relation to any remuneration, payment, perquisite or other benefit, monetary or otherwise in relation to any member of the board including MD & CEO of CHIL can be implemented by the company only after prior approval of IRDAI until further orders. How it all began The insurance company, formerly Religare Health Insurance Company, in 2021 had requested IRDAI for approval to issue stock options to Saluja, as the non-executive director (NED) of CHIL. The insurance regulator had rejected the request as the remuneration guidelines of 2016 permit payment of ""profit related commission"" to NEDs and sitting fees.Insurers also required to take prior approval for providing remuneration to NEDs who are common directors with insurance intermediaries. Saluja is also director with the insurance intermediaries Religare Finvest Ltd and Religare Broking Ltd. In 2023, a news article informed that CHIL had granted 2,27,11,327 ESOPs to Saluja despite rejection by IRDAI. When the regulatory authority asked CHIL for a clarification on this, CHIL confirmed that it had granted the ESOPs to Saluja out of which 75,69,685 were exercised by the director. IRDAI again, through a letter dated May 24, 2024, asked CHIL to comply with its directions within seven days. CHIL asked time till June 6 to respond.On June 6, the insurance company responded by saying that the stock options granted to Saluja as the executive chairperson of REL and not as a non-executive chairperson of CHIL after taking expert legal opinions. REL is the holding company of CHIL. CHIL submitted that the provisions of the IRDAI guidelines issued in 2016 and the authority's circular issued in 2018 were not applicable to the grant of ESOPs to employees of the holding company. IRDAI noted in its order that payment to Saluja who is an NED and chaiperson of CHIL and a common director of an insurance intermediary required the prior approval of the authority. The order stated, ""the fact that Dr Rashmi Saluja held the position of the executive chairperson of the REL does not dilute the requirement of complying with the directions of the IRDAI and the provisions of the regulations, guidelines, circulars issued by the IRDAI"".

The company's  EBITDA margin expanded to 31.6 percent in the quarter gone by, up from 30.5 percent recorded in the year ago period. On the other hand, gross margin surged to a multi-year high of 75.7 percent in the quarter, which was driven by strong growth in the India market, Jefferies stated. ""Torrent seems to be on the cusp of firing on all cylinders with strong Indiagrowth and international regions also joining the growth momentum,""  Jefferies said. ""High sales growth coupled with stable to soft raw material prices will continue to provide margin tailwinds for the company,"" it added. Along with that, the firm also retained its 'buy' call on the stock with a price target of Rs 3,540. Much like Jefferies, Nuvama also reiterated its 'buy' call on Torrent Pharma, but raised its price target for the stock by over 20 percent to Rs 3,606. Motilal Oswal Financial Services also sees Torrent Pharma as a promising play in the pharma space, as it derives 64 percent of its revenue from branded generics and delivers sustainable outperformance over the industry in domestic as well as Brazil markets. Meanwhile, the brokerage expects Torrent's drug approvals in the US to pick up, which would not only boost revenue growth but also improve the profitability of the US generics segment. Despite anticipating strong growth for Torrent, MOFSL still chose to retain its 'neutral' stance on the stock, citing limited upside from current levels. It has a price target of Rs 3,340 for the stock. At 09.20 am, shares of Torrent Pharma were trading  3.4 percent lower at Rs 3,032.80 on the NSE.

"Digital initiative, financial inclusion and MSME troika takes centre stage for Budget 2024",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/digital-initiative-financial-inclusion-and-msme-troika-takes-centre-stage-for-budget-2024-12776605.html,Market,"July 24, 2024 09:57 AM","By Gurpreet Chhatwal The Union Budget for full fiscal 2025 strongly emphasises the critical role the financial sector needs to play in supporting economic growth through a series of welcome announcements. These will arm the lenders in increasing credit flow to the crucial sectors of the economy and optimise outcomes in 3 critical areas — credit expansion, financial inclusion and stressed assets resolution. And the tools used are referred to as the DFM troika, i.e., digital or tech-enabled initiatives, financial inclusion, and MSME (micro, small and medium enterprise) support measures. Digital Initiatives First, technology initiatives in agriculture through successful implementation of the Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) can expand lending to this segment, supported by strengthened underwriting and monitoring to control the traditionally high non-performing assets in the sector. Technology is also expected to contribute to strengthening the recovery ecosystem, with an integrated technology platform to improve implementation of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. This, coupled with other proposed changes, such as strengthening of the tribunal and appellate tribunal, can improve its efficacy from the perspective of both enhancing recovery levels and speeding up the resolution process. Financial Inclusion Two, from an inclusion perspective, the government’s thrust on supporting affordable housing continues with a planned central assistance of Rs 2.2 lakh crore in the next five years. Together with the proposed interest subsidy, this will support growth for companies offering affordable-housing finance. These companies, on the back of a favourable regulatory dispensation and solid underlying demand, have been growing faster than traditional housing finance companies. Further, the proposed 3% interest subvention on education loans to youth currently not eligible for Government benefits should lead to robust growth in the segment. Several other steps focused on women and youth have also been announced. Boost to MSME Sector  Third, and perhaps the most overarching thrust, has been on the MSME front — a number of measures have been proposed to support credit flow to this sector, such as introduction of a credit guarantee scheme for facilitating term loans to MSMEs for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, solidifying credit assessment criteria of MSMEs by public sector banks and providing guarantee from a government-promoted fund to ensure flow of credit to this sector even during stress periods. Further, the role of SIDBI has been enhanced from its hitherto primarily refinance focus to expanding direct lending to MSMEs in addition to raising the limit of MUDRA loans. Also, for facilitating MSMEs to unlock their working capital by converting their trade receivables into cash, the turnover threshold of buyers for mandatory onboarding on the TReDS platform has been reduced. To be sure, today the Indian financial sector is in sound health with strong profitability and comfortable capital buffers. The banking system’s provisioning cover and net non-performing assets are also at their all-time best levels. The measures announced in the Budget are expected to bolster the efforts of the financial sector in supporting overall economic growth by expanding the addressable credit base across various borrower segments, while at the same time supporting lenders’ asset quality. All said, the criticality of the financial sector in achieving the government’s objectives of growth and development is clearly reinforced by the plan for a financial sector vision and strategy document. While the final contours are awaited, this budget is expected to set the agenda for the next five years and provide a framework to guide the efforts of the government, regulators, financial institutions and market participants.

At opening, the Sensex was down 0.16 percent at 80,303 and the Nifty was down 0.15 percent at 24,442. About 1,532 shares advanced, 691 shares declined, and 128 shares unchanged. Follow our LIVE blog for all the market updates ""The increase in capital gains was a sheer surprise but the Finance Minister is trying to bring some uniformity in incentives. There may be some knee-jerk reactions but the overall sentiment is bullish as equity remains one of the most attractive assets,"" Kranthi Bathini, director of equity strategy at WealthMills Securities told Moneycontrol. Read: Capital gains tax hike a sentiment spoiler; revised exemption limit of Rs 1.25 lk paltry, says Shankar Sharma Bathini added that the overall budget is encouraging with emphasis on rural consumption. The impetus to manufacturing and MSMEs too bodes well. The government has allocated Rs 2.66 lakh crore for rural development, including spending on rural infrastructure. Experts attribute a strong liquidity to be outweighing concerns about high valuations. Retail inflow has been robust, driven by direct equity investments, mutual funds, portfolio management services (PMS), and alternative investment funds (AIFs). Also read: Benefits of fiscal consolidation will outweigh capital gains tax hike impact, says Kotak's Nilesh Shah The broader market indices outperformed the headline indices to trade 0.2 and 0.5 percent higher, respectively. The two have nearly rallied 22 percent each since the start of the year. India VIX, also known as the fear gauge remained muted around 13. Among sectoral indices, FMCG was the top gainer after FM Sitharaman announced schemes to boost employment in the Budget, as higher income is expected to raise demand for staples. ""The government has five schemes to facilitate employment and skilling for 4.1 crore youth Central outlay of Rs 2 lakh crore,"" Kranthi Bathini said. FMCG bellwether Hindustan Unilever was buzzing in trade as most brokerages turned positive on India's largest consumer staples player. Laggards include the realty and metal index with the realty being the worst hit, dragged by DLF and Godrej Properties. From a technical standpoint, ""Nifty can find support at 24,400 followed by 24,350 and 24,300. On the higher side, 24,550 can be immediate resistance, followed by 24,650 and 24,700, Deven Mehata, research analyst at Choice Borking said. The charts of Bank Nifty indicate that it may get support at 51,600, followed by 51,500 and 51,300. If the index advances further, 52,000 would be the initial key resistance, followed by 52,200 and 52,500. ITC, Titan Company, HDFC Life, Tata Motors, and Wipro were the top Nifty gainers. Tata Consumer Products, HUL, Bajaj Finance, Nestle India, and Britannia Industries were the major laggards.

Gold prices flat as investors focus on US economic data,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gold-prices-flat-as-investors-focus-on-us-economic-data-12776610.html,Market,"July 24, 2024 09:41 AM","Gold prices struggled for momentum on Wednesday, with investors awaiting U.S. economic data that could influence the Federal Reserve's rate-cut timeline. Spot gold was little changed at $2,408.88 per ounce, as of 0208 GMT. U.S. gold futures ticked up 0.1% to $2,408.80. Investors expect key U.S. data releases this week, including the second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) reading on Thursday and the June personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index number on Friday, to offer more cues about the rate-cut timeline. ""If either the GDP or core PCE figures produce an upside beat, this could provide a stumbling block for gold in the short term on dollar strength,"" said Tim Waterer, KCM Trade's chief market analyst. But ""the near-term outlook for gold remains constructive from a fundamental point of view, given that the Fed appears to be on the doorstep of a rate cut."" The Fed will cut interest rates just twice this year, in September and December, as resilient U.S. consumer demand warrants a cautious approach despite easing inflation, according to a growing majority of economists in a Reuters poll. Bullion prices scaled an all-time high of $2,483.60 last week amid rising bets of rate cuts. Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold. Meanwhile, India slashed import duties on gold and silver to 6% from 15%, which ANZ said should support jewellery manufacturing in the world's second-biggest consumer of bullion and add to an already favourable backdrop for demand. Gold was trading at a premium in India for the first time in 11 weeks on Tuesday. Among other metals, spot silver fell 0.1% to $29.19 per ounce. ""Growth estimates in photovoltaic panel usage have been markedly revised higher, resulting in silver demand draws far exceeding supply. A price squeeze within a few years is becoming more likely,"" Sprott Asset Management said in a report. Platinum was steady at $943.90 and palladium eased 0.1% to $924.75.

Hindustan Unilever reported a 3 percent on-year rise in net profit to Rs 2,538 crore in Q1FY24, slightly beating analysts estimates. The FMCG firm's total sales for the April-June quarter rose 2 percent on-year at Rs 15,523 crore. Also Read | HUL Q1 results beat estimates, net profit up 3% at Rs 2,538 crore HUL noted a recovery in rural demand while continuing to focus on the premium portfolio, and expects its market share to gain from hereon. Nuvama Institutional Equities, Investec and Emkay Global were among the brokerages that have raised their fair value assumptions on HUL, with ICICI Securities upgrading HUL to 'Add'.  With commodity inflation weighing on HUL's margins over the past few years, FY24 saw commodity deflation which is continuing in Q1FY25 as well. However, the inflationary-deflationary cycle seems to be coming to an end. ""We are near the exit of adverse cycle of sharp inflation followed bysteep deflation, boding well for HUL from a market share gainsperspective,"" said Nuvama Institutional Equities. Nomura has stayed bullish on HUL and says the company is on an ""improving path"", with the market share too expected to improve in the medium term. This, coupled with the push to build categories in high-growth spaces and bet on premiumization will support Hindustan Unilever's topline in the coming quarters, Nomura said. Morgan Stanley was an outlier with an 'under-weight' call on HUL, adding that the commentary did not signal confidence of a strong recovery in demand for H2FY26. Price growth is expected to be near-zero in the near term, according to the firm's guidance, while the EBITDA margin seen at current levels of 23.8 percent. HUL's stock price is hovering around its 52-week high, after a sharp up move over the past two months. Shares settled at Rs 2,766 apiece on the NSE in the previous session, higher by 1.1 percent.

"Short Call: Why market veterans are wary; Oberoi Realty, Suzlon, Bajaj Electricals, Supreme Industries in focus",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/short-call-why-market-veterans-are-wary-oberoi-realty-suzlon-bajaj-electricals-supreme-industries-in-focus-12776544.html,Market,"July 24, 2024 07:35 AM","This was clearly not the Budget that stock market investors were looking forward to, even though Tuesday's closing levels seem to indicate that the market has made peace with the higher capital gains taxes. Given the massive liquidity in the system-domestic as well foreign-there is a feeling that the market simply cannot go down, no matter how bad the news. As one fund manager at a local mutual fund told Short Call, “(Retail) investors are not buying because fundamentals are good, they are buying because they think strong SIP flows will continue to support the market endlessly.” That could well be a dangerous assumption. Mutual fund inflows remain strong and new fund offerings (NFOs) too are selling like hot cakes. But liquidity alone cannot be a cure-all for the market, the fund manager said, recalling the massive subscription that UTI’s Mastergain 92 scheme had got in 1992. “It mopped up Rs 4472 crore during its NFO period, which as a percentage of the market capitalisation of that time was quite significant. But it still could not prevent the market from plunging over the next year when the Harshad Mehta scam broke,” the fund manager said. The market may have shrugged off the negatives in the Budget, but seasoned investors are wary. For a market rapidly running out of positive triggers to justify lofty valuations, the Budget has been a bigger dampener than it may seem at first glance. Also, liquidity cannot fix everything all the time, as these veterans have seen many times during their long careers. Suzlon Energy (57.83, +5%) Q1 net profit jumps 3x YoY, revenue from operations soars 50% in Q1FY25; brokerages bullish Bull Case: Strong balance sheet, increased demand driven by the government's ambitious renewable energy targets, positions the company well to benefit from rising demand in both utility and commercial and industrial (C&I) segments. Bear Case: Despite its growth potential, market underappreciation could limit Suzlon stock upside. Risks include ad-hoc government policy changes, intense competition, and slower-than-expected deliveries due to delays in site readiness. Bajaj Electricals (CMP: Rs 967, -3.07%) Anuj Poddar, MD & CEO resigns Bear case: Prabhudas Lilladher analysts believe that the exit of Anuj Poddar could be sentimentally negative given his pivotal role in the company's transformation. Profits have been under pressure over the last four quarters. Bull case: The company's Morphy Richards brands has been performing well, according to analysts. A high profile replacement for Poddar should lift near term sentiment. Oberoi Realty (Rs 1,686, -3.3%) Delivered a strong Q1 performance Bear Case: Valuations remain expensive and the company does not have meaningful pre-sales growth visibility beyond the financial year 2027. Furthermore, delays in project launches and regulatory setbacks could hamper financial health. Bull Case: Occupancy across the office portfolio is expected to rise, with management anticipating that all three Commerz towers will be fully leased by the end of the year. Currently, Commerz 3 is 70 percent leased. Supreme Industries (Rs 5,510, -3.2%) Saw broker downgrades, reduced targets as Q1 profit fell short of estimates. Bull Case: Demand expected to recover after mid-August as PVC prices stabilise. Demand from infrastructure and housing projects expected to support growth. Investment in new product capacities likely to drive near-term growth. Bear Case: High valuations. Disappointing results attributed to lower volumes and margins. Demand weakened during June-July due to falling PVC prices. (With inputs from Harshita, Veer, Lovisha, Neeshita)

Brent crude futures for September rose 46 cents to $81.47 a barrel by 0020 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for September increased 42 cents to $77.38 per barrel. U.S. crude oil, gasoline and distillate inventories fell last week, according to market sources citing the American Petroleum Institute (API), a trade organization. Benchmarks picked up accordingly. WTI had lost 7% over the previous four sessions and Brent shed nearly 5% in the previous three. The API figures showed crude stocks falling by 3.9 million barrels in the week ended July 19, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Gasoline inventories fell by 2.8 million barrels and distillates shed 1.5 million barrels. That would be the first time crude stocks in the United States fell for four weeks in a row since September 2023. Official government data on oil inventory data is due for release on Wednesday. Oil prices fell to a six-week low on Tuesday, with Brent closing at its lowest level since June 9 on ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas in a plan outlined by U.S. President Joe Biden in May and mediated by Egypt and Qatar. Prices also suffered on continued concern that economic softening in China, which is the world's biggest crude importer, would weaken global oil demand.

Before publishing numbers though, the electric vehicle maker's dropped 2%, with the Google parent's shares rising 0.1%. Earnings from technology giants will be key in determining if 2024's record rally can be sustained, or if U.S. stocks are overvalued. The question of whether a rotation away from megacaps in favor of underperforming sectors will continue is also on investors' minds. The small-cap Russell 2000 was up 1% on the day. ""We're paying attention to earnings, as that's what matters this week and next, and the price reaction to those earnings will be very telling,"" said Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers. On the rotation into smaller-cap stocks, he added: ""The jury is still out and we need some more proof of evidence that this is sustainable, and that's again going to come down to earnings."" The megacaps initially buoyed markets on Tuesday, with all three benchmarks trading in positive territory. However, despite most of the megacaps continuing to trade higher - Apple, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Amazon.com all gained between 0.3% and 2.1% - the overall market advances ebbed away in the afternoon, culminating in the small overall declines. Helping subdue equity markets were disappointing earnings from household names. United Parcel Service, seen as a bellwether for the global economy, slumped 12.1% after missing earnings estimates on subdued package delivery demand and higher labor-contract costs. The stock closed at its lowest level in four years. General Motors dropped 6.4% despite a second-quarter results beat and a higher annual profit forecast, while Comcast lost 2.6% after missing revenue estimates. NXP Semiconductors slumped 7.6% after forecasting third-quarter revenue below estimates, dragging the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index 1.5% lower. Among others, Spotify  jumped 12% after posting a record quarterly profit slightly ahead of expectations, while Coca-Cola rose 0.3% after it increased its annual sales and profit forecasts. Of the first 74 S&P 500 companies that reported quarterly results during this earnings season, 81.1% beat expectations, according to LSEG data. Janasiewicz cautioned that while it is early to draw specific conclusions, the pattern seen so far in the earnings season was that companies missing numbers were getting hit hard, while even outperforming doesn't guarantee much of a pop in your stock, given where market prices and expectations are currently. ""If you miss based on where we are right now, maybe there's going to be more punishment doled out,"" he said. The S&P 500 lost 8.67 points, or 0.16%, to 5,555.74 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 10.22 points, or 0.06%, to 17,997.35. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 57.35 points, or 0.14%, to 40,358.09. Eight of the major S&P sectors ended in negative territory, with the energy index the worst performer, down 1.6%, as U.S. crude prices hit a six-week low. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.45 billion shares, compared with the 11.33 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade TCS, Chemfab, Godrej Consumer Products, TTK Prestige, and others on Wednesday?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-tcs-chemfab-godrej-consumer-products-ttk-prestige-and-others-on-wednesday-12776498.html,Market,"July 24, 2024 12:58 AM","The market closed near 24,500 on the Nifty 50, down just 30 points after recouping over 400 points from the day's low on July 23, effectively absorbing the selling pressure following the budget speech. About 1,410 shares declined, while 933 shares advanced on the NSE. Experts see the Nifty 50 moving towards the 24,600-24,700 zone in the immediate term, as long as it holds 24,400 as a support. Here are some trading ideas for the near term: Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Avanti Feeds | CMP: Rs 645.35  Avanti Feeds jumped by more than 10 percent during the day on July 23 after Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that the central government would encourage financing and marketing for shrimp farming via the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD). Despite the sharp rise, prices failed to close above the consolidated zone. A close above Rs 650 is essential for the bullish momentum to continue. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) has shown a bullish crossover, but confirmation is still pending, requiring follow-up buying. The trend for Avanti Feeds is positive. A break above Rs 650 can lift the price higher towards Rs 680, followed by Rs 700, as long as Rs 625 holds on the downside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 680, Rs 700 Stop-Loss: Rs 625 Godrej Consumer Products | CMP: Rs 1,516.70  Godrej Consumer Products rallied around 3 percent on Tuesday. The Nifty FMCG index has rallied more than 10 percent since the beginning of July 2024. The budget announcement towards improving rural demand has fueled the rally in FMCG stocks. Prices gave a breakout of the Rounding Bottom pattern in the previous session, which is a positive sign. Prices also broke out of the upper end of the Bollinger Bands, showcasing a bullish trend. The KST (Know Sure Thing) indicator has turned above the signal line and continues to trade above zero levels, indicating good momentum. The overall trend of the stock is bullish. Use dips as a buying opportunity with a target of Rs 1,580 followed by Rs 1,620. On the downside, Rs 1,450 can act as crucial support. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,580, Rs 1,620 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,450 Chemfab Alkalies | CMP: Rs 787.85  Chemfab Alkalies has been moving higher recently and is in a strong uptrend. In the previous session, it closed with a massive gain of 9.17 percent. Prices formed a bullish candle and closed above Rs 744, confirming a breakout of the Rounding Bottom pattern. Prices continue to trade above the Ichimoku cloud, indicating that the short-term bias is likely to remain bullish. The trend for this stock is positive. Use dips towards Rs 770-780 as a buying opportunity for a move towards Rs 850-860 levels, as long as Rs 740 holds on the downside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 850, Rs 860 Stop-Loss: Rs 740 Dhupesh Dhameja, Technical Analyst at SAMCO Securities Tata Consultancy Services | CMP: Rs 4,302.35  TCS has recently achieved a significant breakout from its all-time high of Rs 4,254 and is currently sustaining above this level. On the daily chart, the stock has completed a Rounding Base chart pattern with a neckline at Rs 4,250. Price trading above its key averages on the daily chart indicates strong bullish sentiment. The weekly chart reveals a multi-year breakout, with the stock trading above its 10-week moving average, further underscoring the bullish trend. The RSI stands at 72 on the daily chart and 66 on the weekly chart, confirming strong momentum. We recommend buying the stock at the current market price of Rs 4,311. We anticipate an upside potential with target prices ranging from Rs 4,500 to 4,650. The bullish outlook remains intact as long as the stock price stays above Rs 4,170. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,500, Rs 4,650 Stop-Loss: Rs 4,170 Uno Minda | CMP: Rs 1,011.35  Uno Minda has recently experienced a substantial rally, nearly doubling from its previous low of Rs 600 to a high of Rs 1,200 in July. It has now completed a retracement to the 0.50 Fibonacci extension level at Rs 950, finding strong support at this point. The stock performed a fake-out from its 50-day moving average. On the weekly chart, it finds robust support at the 10-week moving average. The RSI is above 60 on the weekly chart, while the daily chart shows RSI support at the 40 level. Considering these factors, we recommend buying at the current market price of Rs 1,009.25. We foresee an upside potential with target prices between Rs 1,100 and Rs 1,180. The bullish outlook remains valid as long as the stock price stays above Rs 930. In the Union Budget, the government increased the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for automobiles and auto components to Rs 3,500 crore for FY25, up from Rs 604 crore in FY24. The reduced allocation for FAME is expected to benefit stocks in the future. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,100, Rs 1,180 Stop-Loss: Rs 930 TTK Prestige | CMP: Rs 914.8  TTK Prestige is trading near its 52-week high of Rs 918 and has recently broken out of its re-accumulation pattern following a strong markup phase. The stock is trading firmly above all key moving averages on the daily charts. After being confined within a range of Rs 905-860 with low volume, the stock has broken out of this range with significant volume. The RSI stands above 70 on both daily and weekly charts, highlighting strong momentum. The stock has regained and sustained levels above Rs 900 after nearly two years, indicating building strength. We recommend buying at the current market price of Rs 916 and accumulating up to Rs 900 levels. We anticipate an upside potential with target prices ranging from Rs 965 to Rs 990. The bullish outlook remains intact as long as the stock price stays above Rs 845. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 965, Rs 990 Stop-Loss: Rs 845 Riyank Arora, Technical Analyst at Mehta Equities Walchandnagar Industries | CMP: Rs 326.45  Walchandnagar Industries is showing a strong breakout above its January 2010 highs, gaining momentum along with a significant surge in volumes for July 2024. The RSI (14) on the monthly timeframe is around 78.91 and trending upwards from lower levels, indicating potential for further growth. We expect the stock to reach targets of Rs 590 and Rs 600, with an ultimate target around Rs 1,000. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 590, Rs 600 Stop-Loss: Rs 290 Coforge | CMP: Rs 6,179.35  Coforge has successfully broken above its recent swing high resistance level of Rs 6,143.90 and is holding above this level. With increased trading volumes and the RSI (14) approaching 70, we anticipate targets of Rs 6,650 and Rs 6,700. The positive outlook on IT stocks and Coforge's strong technical structure suggest that the stock will continue to gain momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,650, Rs 6,700 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,800 Persistent Systems | CMP: Rs 4,810  Persistent Systems has broken above its all-time high resistance level and is consolidating well above this mark. With trading volumes nearly double the 30-day average and a rising RSI (14), we expect targets of Rs 5,100 and Rs 5,200. A stop-loss should be set at Rs 4,490 to manage risk effectively. With the IT index being bullish and Persistent Systems being one of the best in the pack, we expect the stock to perform well.

"Trading Plan: Will Nifty 50 return to record high, outperform Bank Nifty post budget?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trading-plan-will-nifty-50-return-to-record-high-outperform-bank-nifty-post-budget-12776496.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 11:53 PM","The market considerably cut down intraday losses following the Budget speech, ending with just one-tenth of a percent down after defending the 10-day as well as 21-day EMAs, raising hopes for an upward journey in the coming sessions. The 24,700 level is expected to be an immediate hurdle, followed by 24,855, the record high, provided it holds the 24,200 support. The Bank Nifty may face resistance at 52,500, with 51,300 as support in the coming session, experts said. On Tuesday, the Nifty 50 declined 30 points to 24,479, and the Bank Nifty dropped 502 points to 51,778. On the NSE, 1,410 shares declined, while 933 shares advanced. Nifty Outlook and Strategy Apurva Sheth, Head of Market Perspectives & Research at SAMCO Securities On the daily charts, Nifty has completed a mean revision retest of the 20-day moving average, finding strong support. Following the budget announcement, Nifty dipped to near 24,000 but quickly rebounded, closing above 24,450 with a recovery of 400 points or 1.60 percent, indicating strong buying at lower levels. Nifty's ability to sustain above its previous swing low of 24,150 suggests the bullish trend remains intact. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is above 60, and the index is trading above its 20-day moving average, confirming the strength of the trend. We believe Nifty has absorbed the budget's impact and remains strong as long as it stays above 24,100. A buy-the-dip strategy is recommended, with the index expected to trade in the 24,000-25,000 range next week. Key Resistance: 24,800, 25,000 Key Support: 24,250, 24,100, 24,000 Strategy: Traders can go for a Short Strangle Strategy, selling the 24,000 strike Put at Rs 65 and the 25,000 strike Call at Rs 45 with August 1 expiry. Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Budget 2024 did not give any strong cheer to the street. Nifty reacted sharply lower post the announcement of an increase in taxes, but prices respected the Gann level of 24,103 and showed a sharp recovery from there. For now, it will be important to see if Nifty can manage to get back above 24,580. A break above 24,580 will extend this move to 24,728. On the downside, immediate support is at 24,270 levels. Key Resistance: 24,850 Key Support: 24,270 Strategy: Long positions can be created above 24,580 with 24,450 as a stop-loss for a target of 24,710. Riyank Arora, Technical Analyst at Mehta Equities The benchmark Nifty 50 continued to show a positive trend, effectively absorbing selling pressure following the budget. Key Resistance: 24,600, 24,850, 25,000 Key Support: 24,400, 24,075, 24,000 Strategy: Buy Nifty at the current market price (CMP) with a strict stop-loss at 24,000, targeting 25,000. Bank Nifty - Outlook and Positioning Apurva Sheth, Head of Market Perspectives & Research at SAMCO Securities Bank Nifty has been lagging behind the Nifty index, exhibiting a sideways to negative trend in recent weeks. The index is on the verge of breaking down from near-term support at 51,700 and has closed below the 20-day moving average, indicating weakness. However, it is still trading above its previous swing low of 51,100, which is its last chance to regain upward momentum. The RSI on the daily chart is below 50, suggesting a halt in the momentum and visible selling pressure. We anticipate that Bank Nifty will underperform the Nifty index and continue to stay in a sideways to bearish trend in the coming week. Key Resistance: 52,700, 53,000 Key Support: 51,300, 51,100, 51,000 Strategy: Traders will look for the conditional Sell on Rise strategy in the index. If it fails to retest 52,300, then they will look to sell the futures for a target of 51,300 and a stop-loss of 53,050. Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors The Bank Nifty looks weak. A breach below 51,300 can confirm a short-term trend change. Key Resistance: 52,600 Key Support: 51,100 Strategy: Short positions can be created below 51,300 with 51,600 as a stop-loss and a target of 51,000.

The index did not see a recovery like the Nifty 50, down 502 points at 51,778.  3) Nifty Call Options Data According to the monthly options data, the 25,000 strike holds the maximum open interest (with 1.12 crore contracts). This level can act as a key resistance level for the Nifty in the short term. It was followed by the 25,500 strike (86.41 lakh contracts) and the 24,500 strike (69.07 lakh contracts). Maximum Call writing was observed at the 25,000 strike, which saw an addition of 44.05 lakh contracts, followed by the 25,200 and 24,600 strikes, which added 27.19 lakh and 22.41 lakh contracts, respectively.

Maximum Call writing was visible at the 52,000 strike (with the addition of 5.63 lakh contracts), followed by the 51,800 strike (1.41 lakh contracts) and the 52,500 strike (1.3 lakh contracts), while the Call unwinding was seen at 51,000 strike, which shed 1.98 lakh contracts, followed by the 50,800 strike, which shed 870 contracts.  6) Bank Nifty Put Options Data On the Put side, the maximum open interest was seen at 51,000 strike (with 19.05 lakh contracts), which can act as a key support level for the index.

The increasing PCR, or being higher than 0.7 or surpassing 1, means traders are selling more Put options than Call options, which generally indicates the firming up of a bullish sentiment in the market. If the ratio falls below 0.7 or moves towards 0.5, then it indicates selling in Calls is higher than selling in Puts, reflecting a bearish mood in the market.  9) India VIX The volatility eased significantly after the Union Budget, erasing almost all of its current month's gains and favouring bulls.

Here are the key themes likely to be in focus post Budget,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/here-are-the-key-themes-likely-to-be-in-focus-post-budget-12776411.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 08:37 PM","From rural consumption to space tech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented a Budget with a mixed bag of announcements that many view as a balancing act between pleasant surprises and mild shocks. “While the budgeted spending on infrastructure, rural and agri has remained same as interim budget, it maintains a fine balance between improving efficiency in agriculture, supporting rural economy and keeping the focus intact on infrastructure spending given limited time left in the current fiscal year,” said Rahul Singh, CIO, Tata Mutual Fund. While there were many announcements across sectors, market experts believe that the following would be the key themes going ahead. Gold Experts believe that companies in the gold and gems & jewellery segment will benefit with the reduction in import duties and increase in taxation on other asset classes. “There is a big cut in customs duty on gold to 6 percent leading to a commensurate decline in gold prices. However, such changes are very important for a healthy gold market in India as it reduces the price anomalies to a large extent from gold prices in India,” says Chirag Mehta, CIO, Quantum AMC. Stocks under this theme include Titan, Mannapuram Finance and Kalyan Jewellers. ConsumptionWith a significant boost to rural consumption, the Finance Minister announced an outlay of Rs 2.66 lakh crore across government schemes aimed at boosting rural infrastructure and consumption. According to Samir Bahl, CEO - Investment Banking, Anand Rathi Advisors, the focus on MSMEs and Rural development along with tax benefits to middle class will result in a boost for demand and consumption. He expects all major consumer companies that cater to rural India and mass consumption to benefit going ahead. Stocks in this segment include Godrej Agrovet, HUL and Dabur. Also read: Five key stocks expected to benefit from the Budget Power & Infrastructure As a part of the Union Budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman emphasised on the government's focus on energy security and transition. While no new schemes were announced, experts believe that policy continuity and further announcements in the coming days could boost the segment such as a policy for promoting pumped storage projects for electricity storage, research & development of small and modular nuclear reactors through partnerships with the private sector and the development of advanced Ultra Super Critical Thermal Power Plants. Rupeeting’s Sagar Lele notes that a lot of work was already laid out in previous budgets. “It is more of a long-term theme,” he says. Beyond the obvious focus on renewable energy, Lele notes that there is significant attention on revamping and creating an overall transition in the grid. “This involves investments in meters, measurement systems, transmission lines, and making the entire grid smarter with IoT. Despite the allocation amount, work on this front is long-term, and I remain positive about the power sector for the next three to five years, especially in the ancillary areas like Hitachi Energy, which supports smart grid implementation,” he says. On infrastructure, he adds that another significant announcement was focus on regions such as the North East, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. “This can lead to increased cement consumption in these regions, benefitting local players and the cement sector overall,” he says. Skill development and job creation Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities believes that job creation could be an important theme going forward. Companies that are engaged in creating jobs or helping upskill people to get new jobs could get better, he explains. These include manpower companies like Quest Corp, NIIT and Veranda Learning. Financial Services Anand Rathi’s Bahl believes that financial services as a theme could also benefit in the long run due to removal of indexation on real estate transactions. Additionally, the LTCG holding period for stocks is one year while for real estate it is two years. “These factors will see a further shift of investments into stock market despite LTCG rates going up,” he says. This includes major mutual fund's as well as broking firms like Angel One. Affordable housing Lele believes that affordable housing could also be a big theme going ahead. “Affordable housing and PMAY (Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana), continues to support demand for building materials like cement, pipes, cables, ceramics, and metal castings. Companies like Astral, APL Apollo, and those in the ceramics and cable industries should continue to be focus stocks,” says Lele. While the Finance Minister also made announcements on Space Technology and Waste and Water management, most experts believe that it is too early for them to have concrete results. Nirav Karkera, Head of Research at Fisdom believes that while it is in a nascent stage, in the long-term it could benefit many defence players. Some water management players include Va Tech Wabag and Anthony Waste Management.

Our commitment to unlocking access to aspiration, market making & premiumization supported by our distinctive capabilities is a key driver of our competitive edge,"" CEO Rohit Jawa said In the earning call for the quarter ended June. HUL's premium portfolio contribution has increased by around 300 basis points over the last 3 years, as consumers have become more discerning and more aspirational compared to the past. This has resulted in most of HUL's premium categories seeing faster volume growth compared to its mass-market peers. HUL has reshaped its portfolio to focus on high growth spaces, such as skincare-infused make-up, international cuisine, or even home care liquids, such as fabric softeners or dishwashing liquids. The first quarter of the current fiscal year was the first quarter wherein HUL reported its ""Beauty & Wellbeing"" and ""Personal Care"" segments separately, as they were a combined category earlier. The categories were separated due to their uneven growth and the competitive landscape. The ""Beauty"" segment contributed Rs 3,199 crore to the topline, as compared to Rs 2,386 crore from the ""Personal Care"" segment. In the beauty segment, while the mass portfolio of the skin care and colour cosmetics declined, the growth momentum continued across premium skin portfolio and channels of the future. Hindustan Unilever reported on Tuesday, 23 July that its Q1 FY25 net profit rose 3 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,538 crore from Rs 2,472 crores in Q1FY24, beating analysts estimates by a slight margin.

"Post-budget, high-quality stocks expected to yield steady returns",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/post-budget-high-quality-stocks-expected-to-yield-steady-returns-12776382.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 07:45 PM","The Finance Minister appears to have shifted strategies, reminiscent of the coalition-era budgets. There were four clear messages from the finance minister: first, equity investments can’t be prioritised over all else; second, government-driven capex can no longer be the primary driver of growth; third, the rural economy and job creation is a problem area which has to take priority forth, that the FM is dead serious about the fiscal consolidation path. What does this mean for stock market investors? The first message is a bit disturbing, stemming from the proposal to increase both long term and short term capital gains tax. While the 2.5% long-term capital gains tax may not drastically alter the return equation to move money away from equity markets, the hike in short-term capital gains tax could certainly take some sheen off equities, especially at a time when markets are already at elevated valuations, and it becomes clear that returns from here will only be modest. Some market participants are reading the capital gains tax hike as a signal that, directionally, the government would want to do away with any preferential tax treatment for equity markets. More importantly, it is arguably a signal from the finance minister that equity market investments should not be prioritised over private capex. Saurabh Mukherjea of Marcellus interprets the increase in capital gains tax as a message to the country’s businessmen to invest in the real economy, not stock markets. Indeed, family offices are a big constituency in the secondary markets today. Promoters selling stakes in their companies and redeploying the proceeds into stock markets are evident from the discretionary flows into mutual funds and the rising assets in AIFs. Direct participation from this segment has also been increasing. This rising participation of family offices also creates a perception that the easy money made in the stock markets post-pandemic is making them shy away from taking bold calls on businesses, slowing private investments. That may or may not be true because traditional industries currently operate at capacity utilisation levels of 70 percent thereabouts, not a level where capex needs to be stepped up immediately. Growth in consumption has not been fast enough to create a sense of urgency to spur private investments either. Not everyone believes in reading too much into the status quo on capex spending; the fact that the interim budget showed a 17 percent capex growth, and we have less than eight months remaining until the next budget, any additional spending would have been challenging to effectively work through the system. Either way, stocks in certain sectors, such as defence and railways, are bound to take a breather without any big triggers. Power, renewables, manufacturing, also seem to be fairly priced or overpriced. But stocks may not be ripe for any significant correction unless there is visible slippage on growth. On the contrary pockets that have not done too well so far, namely consumer stocks, do not make for a compelling case on account of valuations, although growth may be a shade better for these stocks in the coming quarters. Net-net, the narrowing gap between consumer businesses, which deliver slower growth but offer better quality steady earnings, and stocks rising purely on the promise of higher future growth leaves investors with no easy choices. The steep jump in rural spending and schemes for employment generation are unlikely to yield significant gains from a stock market perspective in the immediate term. The only segments that look somewhat reasonably valued are banks. Pharma may be a defensive play. Small-ticket consumer durables and autos might see some traction, as they do not seem excessively valued and have the potential for earnings surprises on the positive side. With the overall market at elevated levels, the best investment strategy may be to remain diversified across sectors and focus on stocks trading at reasonable valuations on a relative basis. High-quality names like Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, Kotak Bank, and ITC could deliver steady returns from hereon. Slowly and steadily, the new money coming into stock markets could be deployed in these stocks, lifting them up from their relatively low valuations. So, a good strategy will be to not look for the next big stock, but the existing big tried and tested stocks.

"Capital-gains tax divides market, STT hike on F&O trades unlikely to deter retail traders",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/capital-gains-tax-divides-market-stt-hike-on-fo-trades-unlikely-to-deter-retail-traders-12776370.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 07:39 PM","The increase in capital gains tax—both long term and short term—came as a nasty surprise for the market. As if to rub it in, the Budget also proposed a hike in securities transaction tax (STT) on derivatives trades. The latter though, does not pose as big a risk to sentiment as the hike in capital gains tax. Following the announcements, Nifty fell by 400 points and Bank Nifty by 800 points, but both indices recovered soon ending 0.12 percent and 0.96 percent lower respectively. Technical analysts believe that Nifty can even retest 24,000 levels, with its resistance level at 24,700-24,800. Also read: Hike in STT on F&O trades a dampener, impact to be felt with a lag, say traders Body blow or good move?While a large section of the market described the capital-gains tax hike as a body blow, others have said that this is good for the real economy and that the panic is unecessary. Ruchit Jain, lead analyst at 5paisa.com, said that it was a volatile day as expected on any big event day. He said that the capital gains taxations caused a drop in Nifty and Bank Nifty but, since there were positive announcements as well, people used this opportunity to buy and therefore there was a sharp recovery from the lows.Sanjay Sinha, founder at Citrus Advisors, described the tax hike a ""body blow"" from the market’s perspective. He said, ""We need to brace ourselves for a negative reaction in the short term."" The positives in the Budget, for him, were raising of income-tax exemption limit to Rs 3 lakh and offering a standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The unexpected increase in the capital-gains tax has sent ""shockwaves"" through the market, said Sonam Srivastava, smallcase Manager and Founder, Wright Research. This move, along with the STT hike, ""is a significant blow to the already beleaguered broking industry,"" she said and added that the policy decision was a materialisation of the government's stated concern about channelling household savings into the capital market. Then there are the others who believe that this hike will simply change the way people approach the capital market and not chase them away from it. Research Analyst Ayush Agrawal said, ""Since now there is a wider gap between STCG and LTCG tax, this will motivate people to do more of investing than short term trading. But think from a perspective of what happened in US markets. Did a higher capital gain tax affect a multi-decadal rally? No."" In an interaction with Moneycontrol, Saurabh Mukherjea, founder and chief investment officer of Marcellus Investment Managers Pvt Ltd, said that the tax hike is a clear indication from the government that it wants businessmen to invest in the real economy and get the private capex going.Mukherjea said that ""the signal is very very clear"" that the government will tax you if you are trying to liquididate stake and invest (in stock markets) by setting up family offices. If this year's capital-gains tax does not push the business people to do so, Mukherjea believes the government will keep hiking the capital-gains tax in the coming Budgets till it is on part with the corporate tax, which starts at 25 percent of income. He believes this is a good Budget for the economy and therefore a good Budget for the market. STT impactRajesh Srivastava, a veteran trader, said that STT's doubling won't deter retail investors from the derivatives trading. What it could do is cause high-frequency traders to take a follow a different strategy that requires lesser number of transactions. ""People have borne deep losses from tech glitches on the brokers' platforms and continued to trade, they will take this hike in their stride as well,"" he said. HFT traders may move away from sophisticated strategies like delta-neutral strategies, which require taking frequent trades to neutralise the effect of any market move, and try other strategies such as straddle or strangle with combined premiums, he added. Agrawal too believes that there is no reason to be worried from the STT hike. He said, ""FnO is like a bad habit, smoking or gambling. In the long run, this is a non-event."" Srivastava also sees money moving from stock markets to precious metals like gold, silver and platinum because the Budget has lowered the customs duty on these metal drastically, from 15 percent to 6 percent on the first two metals and from 15 percent to 6.4 percent on the third metal. Also read: Don't think hike in capital gains tax big enough to deter market investments, says Rahul Arora What levels next?5paisa's Jain said that Nifty seems to have entered ""a corrective phase as we had already seen a rally ahead of the Budget and the RSI oscillator has given a negative crossover from the overbought zone"". He estimates the immediate support for the Nifty to be placed at around 24,200 followed by 24,000 and the resistance zone to be between 24700-24,800. Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, too said that the index seems to have entered a correction phase with it violating the higher top-higher bottom formation and believes that it can correct till 24000 – 23800. Gedia said, ""The daily momentum indicator has a negative crossover which is a sell signal. Thus, the minor degree pullback towards 24,550 – 24,600 should be used as a selling opportunity."" Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP Securities said, ""Heavy call writing at 24,500 indicates that the selling pressure will remain prevalent in the market until Nifty decisively breaches above 24,500. On the lower end, a fall below 24,400 might trigger a correction towards 24,200/24,000."" (With inputs from Sucheta Anchaliya.)

""We expect NIMs to resume its sideways movement after one more quarter. Margin contraction seen in the June-ended quarter was attributed primarily to higher funding costs as well as AUM composition,"" the management said in their post-earnings conference call. In Q1FY25, the cost of funds increased by 8 basis points, on a sequential basis, to 7.94 percent.

Five key stocks expected to benefit from the Budget,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/five-key-stocks-expected-to-benefit-from-the-budget-12776359.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 07:39 PM","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman made a number of announcements on agriculture, generating employment, and reduction in import duties for gold, and silver, among other things. Here are five stocks which market experts believe are likely to benefit from the announcements. Godrej AgrovetAs much as Rs 1.52 lakh crore has been set aside for agriculture and allied sectors – an increase from the Rs 1.27 lakh crore earmarked in the Interim Budget. Further, Sitharaman announced financial support for setting up a network of Nucleus Breeding Centers for Shrimp Broodstocks with the basic customs duty on certain broodstock, polychaete worms, shrimp, and fish feed reduced to 5 percent. Customs duties have also been exempted on various inputs for manufacturing shrimp and fish feed. These factors are expected to benefit agriculture-based stocks like Godrej Agrovet, said Saurabh Mukherjea in a conversation with Moneycontrol. Godrej Agrovet is involved in the business of animal feed for cattle and shrimp. It also sells vegetable oil, crop protection products, dairy, and poultry. Marcellus, in a note to its shareholders, said, “We expect a much better outlook for Godrej Agrovet's earnings going forward, driven by favorable government policies such as the National Mission on Edible Oils – Oil Palms (NMEO-OP) and Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana, which are likely to impact the earnings of the vegetable oils and fish feed businesses respectively.” Titan CompanyIn order to enhance domestic value addition in gold and precious metal jewellery, the customs duty on gold and silver was reduced to 6 percent from 15 percent earlier. The reduction in customs duty will benefit players like Titan Company, where almost 87 percent of its product category is jewellery. Even though there is high competition in the jewellery segment, Titan Company is better placed than others because its new formats like Caratlane, Mia and Zoya will help sustain above teen growth in coming years, said Amnish Agarwal, head of research at Prabhudas Lilladher. Teamlease ServicesThe FM has announced that one crore youth will get internships in top Indian companies in the next five years. This move is set to benefit companies like Teamlease Services, which is an HR consultant, said Amit Doshi, fund manager at Care Portfolio. The company looks into recruitment, on-boarding, and operations of professionals. Borosil Renewables The government has increased the customs duty on solar glass in order to protect domestic solar glass manufacturers. Further, duties on certain additional capital goods used in the manufacture of solar cells and modules have been waived off. This announcement is expected to directly benefit players like Borosil Renewables, which is involved in the manufacturing of solar glass, said Agarwal. Adani WilmarTo achieve self-sufficiency in pulses and oilseeds, the government will strengthen their production, storage, and marketing, said the FM in her budget speech. She mentioned that a strategy is being put in place to achieve 'atmanirbharta' for oilseeds such as mustard, groundnut, sesame, soybean, and sunflower. Adani Wilmar will benefit from this as it manufactures soybean oil, palm oil, sunflower oil, rice bran oil, mustard oil, groundnut oil, and others, said Divam Sharma of Green Portfolio.

Some disappointments but aligns well with expectations,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/some-disappointments-but-aligns-well-with-expectations-12776348.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 07:12 PM","The latest budget aligns well with expectations, particularly regarding fiscal discipline. The budget's fiscal deficit target of 4.9 percent is better than anticipated. I believe it can create a positive environment for the country. Additionally, the government has committed to reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio, which indicates a strong financial outlook, which bodes well for the interest rate environment and overall economic health. Another standout announcement is the maintained capital expenditure (capex) growth of 17 percent over the previous year. With an allocation of Rs 11 lakh crore, the budget ensures the continuity of capex momentum. This commitment is crucial as it reflects the government's intent to utilize its resources effectively. Moreover, the RBI dividend has been strategically used to fund initiatives focused on employment generation and rural development. The budget allocates higher amounts for the benefit of farmers and the rural population, which is expected to boost consumption and take care of investment outlooks. In terms of taxation, the budget offers some relief, especially for lower-income groups. For instance, individuals earning up to Rs 15 lakhs will benefit from an increased tax rebate of Rs 17,500. This move is expected to positively impact lower consumption items. However, there are some drawbacks and disappointments. Changes to long-term and short-term capital gains taxes, may have a slightly negative impact on the capital market. The removal of indexation benefits on long term gains from the real estate transactions is also seen as a marginally negative change for the real estate sector. The market also had expectations around options and F&O trade, but they have increased the STT. This could perhaps be because SEBI has formed a committee to look at this and there may be more announcements from SEBI beyond what has happened in the budget. The budget also addressed the states of Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. This I believe demonstrates a collaborative approach with state governments and reinforces confidence in the government's partnership model. The budget's approach to the oil and gas sector, particularly the lack of LPG subsidies, has been met with some disappointment. However, these are considered minor nuances in an otherwise fiscally disciplined budget.This could be as a part of the government's long term goals of ""Viksit Bharat"" with initiatives in employment, rural development, skill training, and more. These efforts will marginally add to consumption with the benefits they provide, such as stipends for first-time job holders. When you add up these pieces, they should bring benefits. While not everything was addressed, and it could have been better, the proposals combined with changing monsoon patterns affecting income levels should overall be fine.

The latest Budget saw a shift from previous years’ emphasis on government-driven capital expenditure (capex) to prioritising consumption and rural development. Mukherjea said that this pivot shows the government is trying to stimulate domestic demand even as it tries to keep fiscal deficit within acceptable limits. Also Read | Don't think hike in capital gains tax big enough to deter market investments, says Rahul Arora According to Mukherjea, FII's like consumption and private sector banking. ""FIIs are not particularly keen on loading up on government capex because government capex tends to come and go depending on the political realities on the ground."" ""The FM is signalling that the government wind is blowing in favor of helping consumption, juicing up employment. I think this sort of budget is pro FII,"" Mukherjea said. What Mukherjea found more encouraging, from a long-term investor perspective, is the government saying that not only will it stoke consumption and try to juice up consumption but it will do so without compromising on fiscal rectitude. ""I think that's just brilliant."" Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

It’s difficult for finance ministers to pass the markets muster when it comes to Budgets. A Moneycontrol analysis shows that markets have trended lower after Budget presentation on 13 of the last 18 occasions. On July 23, the BSE Sensex closed 73 points lower at 80,429.04. The interim Budget in February this year witnessed a 106.8 point dip.  Final budgets post the election seem to be more prone to negative market reactions compared with other times. In 2019, Nirmala Sitharaman’s July 5 Budget was followed by a 1.19 percent fall in markets within a day, while former finance minister Arun Jaitley had no better luck with markets declining 0.34 percent. Pranab Mukherjee was worst affected with a 6.14 percent decline in Sensex on July 6, 2009. But the incumbent FM’s track record is no better than previous one. Nirmala Sitharaman had faced negative reaction from markets in five of her seven budgets, while Arun Jaitley saw the red in four of his five Budgets and Pranab Mukherjee witnessed dips in three of the five budgets.

The company will release its Q1 results on July 24, 2024. According to the average estimate of eight brokerages, Mumbai-headquartered Axis Bank is projected to register a 13 percent year-on-year (YoY) profit growth at Rs 6,576 crore in Q1FY25 as against Rs 5,797 crore in Q1FY24. NII is also expected to rise by 12 percent YoY to Rs 13,361 crore in Q1FY25, compared to Rs 11,958 crore in the same period last year.  What factors are driving the earnings? Strong loan, deposit growth: Axis Bank's loans, or advances, are expected to increase by 13.5 percent YoY to Rs 9.74 lakh crore in Q1FY25, while deposits are predicted to grow by 12.3 percent YoY to Rs 10.5 lakh crore, according to analysts at YES Securities. Improving asset quality: The lender's gross non-performing assets (NPA) are likely to decrease to 1.5 percent in the quarter ended June, down from 1.7 percent in the same period last year. Net NPA is also expected to improve to 0.3 percent in Q1FY25, from 0.4 percent a year ago, according to Motilal Oswal analysts. Margin contraction: Analysts at Phillip Capital anticipate a 6 basis points (bps) YoY contraction in Axis Bank's margins to 4.04 percent in Q1FY25, down from 4.1 percent in Q1FY24 due to rising funding costs. What to look out for in the quarterly show? Market participants will keenly watch out for Axis Bank's margin outlook, slippages in unsecured segment, deposit mobilisation, and asset quality trends for the rest of the fiscal year. So far this year, the stock of this private lender surged over 14 percent, outpacing benchmark Nifty 50's 12 percent rise.

Budget's tax cut benefit overshadowed by indexation losses,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/budgets-tax-cut-benefit-overshadowed-by-indexation-losses-12776278.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 06:25 PM","The Union Budget 2024 has introduced significant changes in the taxation of property, reflecting the government's efforts to diversify the investment landscape. One of the notable adjustments is the reduction of the Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax rates. While this reduction may be aiming to attract more investment into property and bring in tax rationalisation compared to equity asset class, removal of the indexation benefit is a dampener. Before the budget, property sales were subject to a 20 percent LTCG tax rate with the indexation benefit. The new tax rate of 12.5 percent comes without the indexation benefit, which is a significant change. The removal of the indexation benefit is disappointing for long-term investors who have relied on it to mitigate the impact of inflation on their gains. Real estate investments, particularly which are long-dated, are expected to have higher effective capital gains tax on account of the new provision. The immediate impact of these changes is visible in the real estate sector. The stocks of major real estate companies such as DLF Ltd, Godrej Properties, Oberoi Realty, and Brigade Enterprises have dropped by 3-5 percent by the end of the day. While the reduced tax rate aims to attract investment, the elimination of the indexation benefit could pose challenges for long-term holders, potentially leading to higher tax liabilities and affecting investment decisions in the real estate sector.

Qualified institutional buyers were at the forefront of boosting IPO subscription, buying 145.68 times the allotted quota, followed by non-institutional investors (high networth individuals) who picked 136.5 times. The portion set aside for retail investors was subscribed 24.23 times. The company will finalise the basis of allotment of IPO shares by July 24, while the equity shares will be credited to demat accounts of eligible investors by July 25.

"Budget 2024: Bulls leap over yet another wall of worry, this time higher capital market taxes",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/budget-2024-bulls-leap-over-yet-another-wall-of-worry-this-time-higher-capital-market-taxes-12776303.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 06:15 PM","Santosh Nair Dalal Street was widely expecting the Budget to have a rural slant after the BJP’s recent subpar electoral performance, but not the slew of tax hikes that was thrown their way. The popular reasoning was that any tinkering with the capital gains tax structure could spark a sell-off in an already frothy market, something the government would be keen to avoid. Much to their surprise, both long term and short term capital taxes were hiked, and so was the securities transaction tax (STT) on derivatives trades. In addition, income from share buyback which was so far taxed at 20 percent will be treated as dividend and taxed as per the income tax slab of the investor. Interestingly, after a sudden plunge, the market overcame its disappointment quickly and at one point briefly crossed over to the positive before ending slightly lower, but well off the lows for the day. What explains the dramatic recovery? The most dominant factor is strong liquidity, which for the moment seems to be drowning out concerns of expensive valuations. Retail inflows have been quite strong, through direct equity investments as well as vehicles like mutual funds, portfolio management service (PMS) funds and Alternate Investment Funds (AIFs). More importantly, foreign portfolio investors who were complaining of rich valuations till a couple of months back, too have joined the party. Post the election verdict, FPIs have net bought over Rs 55,000 crore worth of shares.This is in addition to the Rs 20,000 crore odd that is flowing into the systematic investment plans (SIPs) of domestic funds every month. Two, the buy-on-dips strategy is working like a charm as far retail investors are concerned. And this is only attracting more players waiting on the sidelines. In March, market regulator SEBI had warned of a froth in small and midcaps. After a short lived correction, the market has rallied even more stronly from those levels. Many mutual funds increased their cash holdings in recent weeks, fearing that valuations had gotten out of whack. But the cumulative cash positions of all mutual funds put together, even at 4-5 percent of their portfolios, accounts to well over a trillion rupees. And when the market keeps moving higher, the funds have little choice but to put their money to work. Thirdly, while many promoters and private equity investors have been selling stakes over the past many months, a good chunk of that money too is again finding its way back into the stock market, either directly or via family offices and AIFs. Still, the concerns about valuations are hard to ignore. Prashant Jain of 3P Investment Managers said the Budget was overall positive despite the tax hikes, but he is cautious in his outlook, barring some pockets of the market. In particular, he is bearish on stocks in the manufacturing, industrial, and defence sectors, irrespective of whether they are public sector or private. Jain's caution stems from the sharp surge in these stocks over the last year. While markets are pricing extremely high growth for these sectors, Jain believes the risk-reward ratio for stocks in this space is unfavourable at this time. And some of the derivatives traders too feel most market participants are reading too much into Tuesday’s recovery from the intra-day lows. “Last year, there was an increase in STT, and we closed 0.20% down, but the following week it fell by 1.5%,” said Rajesh Srivastava, a Bengaluru-based trader. “The impact is always felt on over the following days,"" he said. Emkay Global's strategist Seshadri Sen has warned of an impending 5-10 percent correction in the Nifty in the days ahead as Nifty valuations are already pricey at 21.4 times one year forward earnings and that the market is running out of triggers to sustain such lofty valuations. Also, world markets have begun to sell off and it is a matter of time before the Indian markets too become a part of the global correction, according to Sushil Kedia, founder of Kedianomics, in conversation with Moneycontrol.

"Markets resilient despite capital gains tax, experts say earnings and liquidity intact",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/capital-gains-tax-expert-reaction-12776286.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 06:08 PM","The stock market staged a quick rebound from the Budget day low, showing strength, looking beyond the long-term and short-term capital gains tax tweaks introduced in the Union Budget on July 23. Explaining why the market did not sell off, veteran market investor Raamdeo Agarwal said investors are choosing to look at the potential of earnings growth, which is intact, and that the negative market sentiment may not last. ""People come to markets for capital gains which has not been impacted, not on what tax rate is in place,"" Raamdeo added. Benchmark Nifty 50 registered an intra-day swing of nearly 500 points on July 23, and despite the tinkering in capital market taxation, ended flat at close. Corporate earnings look intact, so the institutional investors will have to come, Raamdeo told CNBC-TV18, adding that mutual fund flows will decide the market trends going forward. According to a projection, the cash holding of equity-based mutual funds till June was at Rs 1.52 lakh crore, roughly 5 percent of the AUMs. The short-term capital gains on equities shall now attract a rate of 20 per cent while long-term gains on all financial and non-financial assets will attract 12.5 per cent rate, revised upwards from 10 per cent earlier. Limit of exemption of capital gains has been increased to ₹1.25 Lakh per year to benefit lower and middle-income classes. Broking shares, however, fell on news of the hike in the long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) and Securities Transaction Tax (STT) in the Budget 2024-25.

Napean Capital's Gautam Trivedi came out in support of government's move to increase taxation of capital gains, and said it was necessary, given the degree of speculative activity in the markets. ""The budget is not populist, and has focus on infra and agriculture, and while the debate has been on STCG, it was needed to cool down the markets"", Gautam told CNBC-TV18.

Fiscal deficit: Go easy or pull back? What markets are likely to reward,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/fiscal-deficit-go-easy-or-pull-back-what-markets-are-likely-to-reward-2-12776140.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 06:18 PM","By Avnish Jain, Head Fixed Income, Canara Robeco Mutual Fund The decision to either ease or tighten fiscal deficits depends largely on the political environment, economic context, and goals of the government. If economic growth is slowing down or in recession, a government may undertake fiscal stimulus to support the economy. Conversely, if economic growth is near or higher than the potential growth rate, a government may tighten fiscal policy to prevent the economy from overheating. Fiscal spending has a direct impact on growth as it puts money directly into the hands of people. Going Easy on Fiscal Deficit: Impact Equity Markets: Stock markets often respond positively to increased government spending through increased allocation to the real economy or through tax cuts. The extra spending can boost corporate earnings and consumer spending, thereby improving company valuations. Rate Markets: The rate market is generally wary of excess government spending as it generally leads to higher market borrowings. Higher government spending, especially if it is consumption-related, may lead to higher inflation in the short term. Further, prolonged periods of loose fiscal policy may entrench inflation and lead to tighter monetary policy. Currency Markets: The currency might depreciate if the policy leads to concerns about inflation or long-term fiscal sustainability. Pulling Back on Fiscal Deficit: Market Reaction: Financial markets might view a decision to pull back on fiscal deficit as a sign of fiscal discipline and responsibility. This can lead to confidence in the government’s ability to manage debt and economic stability. Equity Markets: In the short term, the stock market may respond negatively as lower fiscal policy leads to lower consumption and investments, hence impacting company profitability. However, fiscal discipline over the longer term may attract long-term capital as investors favor a stable economic environment. This may lead to better performance in equities over the long term. Rate Markets: Bond markets tend to react positively to fiscal prudence, as it reduces the risk of default and inflation. Fiscal prudence may reduce overall government market borrowing, which may be favorable for rate markets from a supply-side perspective. Reduction in fiscal deficit over longer periods can lead to lower interest rates, which are likely to benefit long-term economic prosperity. Currency Markets: A stronger fiscal position could support the currency, as it signals stability and attractiveness for foreign investors and will likely favor long-term capital asset allocators. Factors Influencing Market Response: Economic Conditions: In times of economic downturn or recession, markets may favor a more lenient approach to fiscal deficits to stimulate growth as a short-term measure to shore up consumption expenditure and support the economy. Markets welcome government dynamically managing fiscal policy to manage downturns as a sign that fiscal policy is driven by economic factors rather than politics. If fiscal profligacy is due to political reasons, market sentiment may turn negative. Inflation Expectations: Consistently high deficits can lead to inflationary pressures, which might worry markets and lead to negative reactions. Over the longer term, higher inflation can lead to economic instability. Investor Confidence: Market sentiment plays a crucial role; if investors perceive that a government’s fiscal policy is sustainable and growth-oriented, i.e., investment-related fiscal push, they are likely to react positively. If the deficit is used for consumption-related expenditures, it is likely to be perceived negatively by investors. The Union Budget 2024-25 continues to follow fiscal consolidation efforts, budgeting a fiscal deficit at 4.9% of GDP for FY2025. The aim is to reach 4.5% of GDP by FY2026. This should create positive sentiment for investors as fiscal consolidation, in the wake of strong economic growth, is likely to temper inflationary pressures and be conducive to long-term sustainable growth, as the Indian economy endeavors to become a developed economy. Markets are likely to reward such an outcome. In conclusion, both approaches to fiscal deficit management can potentially be rewarded by markets depending on the prevailing economic conditions and the perceived impact on economic growth, inflation, and overall stability. Flexibility and alignment with broader economic goals are key to gauging market reactions accurately.

On the way to fiscal consolidation. Will rating upgrade follow?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/on-the-way-to-fiscal-consolidation-will-rating-upgrade-follow-12776249.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 05:46 PM","By Nilesh Shah, Managing Director of Kotak Mahindra AMC Budget 2024 signals a strong commitment to India's macroeconomic story. It sets the fiscal deficit target for FY25 at 4.9 percent of GDP, lower than market expectations. In absolute terms, this amounts to Rs 16.15 lakh crore. For FY26, it aims to bring the deficit below 4.5 percent. These targets look credible. The budget keeps the nominal GDP growth rate at 10.5 percent, same as was projected in February 2024. This is a realistic assumption, despite an 8 percent real growth in the second half of FY24 and RBI's FY25 growth projections at 7.2 percent. Extra revenues from RBI have been prudently used by increasing total expenditure only by ~ Rs 50,000 crore, while keeping capital expenditure constant and the balance being utilised in reducing the fiscal deficit. As the bulk of the increase in expenditure outlay is in the form of asset creation (houses/ roads etc), the budget is non-inflationary and would provide comfort to RBI on the inflation front. We believe the actual fiscal deficit for FY25 could be lower due to higher tax collection on account of tax buoyancy. For FY26, the government needs to curtail its fiscal deficit by about Rs 30,000 crore -40,000 crore to ensure it's below 4.5 percent. This is achievable through better tax compliance or increased non-tax revenue and disinvestments. Also read: FM Sitharaman stands firm on fiscal discipline; RBI dividends help in juggling post-poll necessities The budget's priorities are clear. It focuses on economic growth drivers. Special attention is given to empowering women, youth, employment, and skill development. A sum of Rs 1.48 lakh crore is allocated for these. There are new ideas too, like internships with top 500 companies. This shows a push for self-reliance over handouts. After a long time, we see some tax changes. Standard deduction for salaried people is up. Import duty on gold and silver is down. LTCG (Long-Term Capital Gains), STCG (Short-Term Capital Gains) tax rates for equities have increased. Revenue estimates are conservative. Given higher returns on its dollar investment, the RBI is likely to give a higher dividend next year too. Even accounting for additional spending, the government may have a Rs 20,000 crore-30,000 crore surplus left to reduce the FY26 deficit. If the actual fiscal deficit for FY25 is lower than 4.9 percent, then achieving 4.5 percent or even lower in FY26 would be simpler. Also read: What Budget 2024 means for India Inc. The Finance Minister's approach is like an all-rounder in cricket. It steers the economy towards a possible sovereign rating upgrade, much like winning a championship.

If executed well, India could see improved fiscal health and a high chance of a sovereign rating upgrade in future.

Moreover, the overall development of infrastructure in other eastern states such as Odisha, Jharkhand, and West Bengal will provide order opportunity for NCC. NCC has a strong understanding of the eastern market (several projects are under execution) and will benefit from these developments.

Markets recoup losses even as tax hike impacts investor sentiments,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/markets-recoup-losses-even-as-tax-hike-impacts-investor-sentiments-12776269.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 05:28 PM","It is often said that looks can be deceptive and on Tuesday, it was clearly evident in the stock markets. For the benchmarks ended the day almost flat, thereby totally concealing the fact that it was a highly volatile day as finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman rattled the markets by hiking both long-term capital gains tax and short-term capital gains tax apart from increasing the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on derivatives. The impact of the announcements was corroborated by the fact that the benchmark 30-share Sensex plunged more than 1200 points in a matter of minutes following the announcements related to the taxes that directly impact the investor and trader community. Around 12:31pm, the Sensex fell to an intra-day low of 79,224.32, down 1205 points from Monday’s close of 80,502.08, as Sitharaman announced that LTCG tax rate would be increased to 12.5 percent from the current 10 percent while STCG rate would be hiked to 20 percent from the current 15 percent. Further, STT on derivatives has been hiked to 0.02 percent. However, as the trading session came to an end, the benchmarks recouped a significant part of their losses with the 30-share Sensex closing at 80,429.04, down 73.04 points or 0.09 percent. The broader Nifty settled at 24,479.05, down 30.20 points or 0.12 percent. The market breadth was also weak with as many as 2160 stocks losing ground on BSE, as against 1743 advances. The broader indices including BSE MidCap, BSE SmallCap, BSE 100, BSE 200 and BSE 500 among others fell more compared to the benchmark Sensex. In terms of stocks and sectors, metal recycling entities like Gravita India, Urban Enviro Waste Management, Antony Waste Handling, and Eco Recycling moved northwards following positive announcements for recycling critical minerals. Similarly, consumer durables shares jumped as Sitharaman announced significant measures to boost rural demand, consumer spending and economic growth. Titan, ITC, Adani Ports, NTPC and HCL Tech were among the top gainers in the Nifty Consumer Durables index, which itself was up around 2 percent. On the other hand, railway stocks including IRCTC, Container Corporation of India (Concor), Titagarh Rail Systems, Texmaco, and Rail Vigas Nigam Ltd (RVNL) all ended in the red as the budget failed to meet the market expectations for the sector. Among the Sensex pack, 17 lost ground with stocks like HDFC Bank, L&T, ICICI Bank and Reliance Industries contributing the most to the day’s fall. On the other hand, the gainers’ pack was led by ITC, Infosys and Titan. Jefferies India upgraded ITC Ltd to a buy rating, raising the target price to Rs 585 per share, up 25 percent from current market price after tobacco taxes remained unchanged in Budget 2024. Market participants, however, have put up a brave face and are saying that the hike in taxes is indeed a “dampener” or a “sentiment spoiler” but the long-term case for equities remains intact. “Change in capital gains tax (increase) and increase in STT may be a near term sentiment spoiler, however as market focus moves to growth trajectory and earnings potential, the medium to long term case for equities remain intact,” said Lakshmi Iyer, CEO-Investment & Strategy, Kotak Alternate Asset Managers. “FPI continues to be net buyers in both equities and fixed income, which also adds to the liquidity flows from external sources,” she added. Similarly, market veteran Shankar Sharma said that he is “cautious” in terms of the impact of the tax hike. “Markets have run up a lot, and they look for reasons to correct. Incremental bad news can have a disproportionate effect. This tax hike is an unnecessary sentiment spoiler when things are going well, said Sharma, the founder of GQuant. Meanwhile, Amit Jeswani, Founder, Stallion Asset says that the market is not reacting badly to bad news and the “markets are giving us signs that we are in a bull market.” “If you would have asked me in the morning how would the market react if the government increased short-term capital gain tax from 15 percent to 20 percent, I would have told you the market would be down two or three percent,” he said.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in the Union Budget 2024,  hiked the long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) on all financial and non-financial to 12.5 percent from 10 percent, while short-term capital gains tax (STCG) on some assets would be raised to 20 percent. Along with that, the finance minister also proposed increasing the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) rates. She announced in the Union Budget that the STT on the sale of options in securities will rise from 0.0625 percent to 0.1 percent of the option premium, and the STT on the sale of futures in securities will increase from 0.0125 percent to 0.02 percent of the trading price. Also Read | Long term capital gains tax hiked from 10% to 12.5% in Union Budget Reacting to these changes in the capital gains structure, Indian equity markets witnessed a sharp negative reaction, with the benchmarks Nifty 50 and Sensex, falling over 2 percent each. However, the knee jerk reaction soon faded away, with both the benchmarks ending near the flatline on the budget day. Talking about this hike in capital gains tax, Arora stated that it doesn't change much in the scheme of things for the government from a revenue perspective. ""If you look at the mathematics, this would probably add about Rs 20,000 crore of revenue to an otherwise estimated revenue of almost about Rs 32 lakh crores, which isn't even 10 percent or 5 percent of the total,"" Arora said. However, he does believe that these changes will have a sentimental impact of both on the futures and options as well as on the cash market. Regardless of that, Arora believes the increase in the exemption limit for the capital gains tax has offset some bit of the capital gains tax hike. The finance minister also proposed to increase the limit of exemption of capital gains on certain financial assets to Rs 1.25 lakh per year, aimed to benefit the lower and middle-income classes. In conclusion, Arora believes that the market will eventually come to absorb this hike in capital gains tax, in the larger scheme of things. ""I think prima facie hiking the rates is negative, but I think the way the market has reacted from the day's is low is telling you that people are ready to buy into equities.  So this is not something that is not digestible for the market,"" Arora said.

The Budget is in sync with the expectations of being a populist,"" Divam Sharma, Founder and Fund Manager at Green Portfolio said in an interview wih Moneycontrol. LTCG (Long Term Capital Gains) and STCG (Short Term Capital Gains) tax increases were in line with expectations, said Sharma, a Member of The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, who has worked with banks including Kotak Mahindra Bank, Citibank, and IMGC in the past. Sharma, who has over 14 years of experience in investment management in stock markets, bets on agriculture and renewable energy segments post Budget. What is your rating for the Union Budget and is it really a game changer? We would rate it as 4/5. The Budget is in sync with the expectations of being a populist. There have been announcements for spreading prosperity among the larger population of the society. The spending on agriculture, infrastructure development, skilling, and startups has the potential to create a multiplier impact on the economy and can unleash the animal instincts of consumption participation coming from the broader population. Click Here To Read All Budget Related News We have also seen an emphasis on technology solutions and AI which is forward looking. Fiscal deficit target at 4.9 percent look conservative considering the announcements. LTCG (Long Term Capital Gains) and STCG (Short Term Capital Gains) tax increases were in line with expectations. The markets might have some reaction to this, although this was in expected lines with the existing and potential gains financial assets offer and we expect the continuity of liquidity to the markets unlike in 2018. Angel Tax abolition is a welcome step as we plan to step up the startup ecosystem. Also read: Budget 2024: Here's the full text of Nirmala Sitharaman's speech Are the LTCG, STCG and STT hikes a big negative for the equity market? The tax hikes on capital gains are on expected lines with the existing and potential gains financial assets offer and we expect the continuity of liquidity to the markets unlike in 2018. The FM has increased the threshold amount for taxation to seemingly compensate for the increased taxes, but that isn’t much relief to investors. Investors surely are disappointed but markets however will be fine soon. This is nothing new for the Indian markets, which saw even a 20 percent LTCG tax two decades ago, and it's still lower than a few other asset classes. So, while the investor sentiment will stay a bit dull for some time, it will soon recover. With good allocation to manufacturing, infrastructure, and more, the economy is poised to grow, and as we’ve seen, the markets grow when the economy does. Do you see the continuation of buy on dips strategy? Yes. We see the continuation of the Buy the Dip strategy. Post LTCG and STCG announcements, we saw a major dip in the market despite the fact that the Budget was in line with the market expectations. More than Buy the Dip, we would prefer SIP as a form of disciplined investment. Considering the Budget announcements, some pockets will do really well, hence we can see sector rotation and stock rotation playing in. Also read: How will Budget 2024 impact you? Here's a look Which are the sectors to pick for your portfolio post Budget? Agriculture The FM has announced nine priorities starting with agriculture. The government did not see much support from farmers during the elections and this looks like a measure to mobilise them. MSP for all major crops has been increased. It’s very much to the benefit of farmers as a promise of a 50 percent margin over the cost of production has been made for MSP. The Gareeb Kalyan Anna Yojana has also been extended. One thing we particularly like is the support being lent for shrimp production, and financing via NABARD. We have a stock in our portfolio that is into shrimps. The Centre is moving more and more towards technology so improving digital public infrastructure for agriculture only makes sense. With an allocation of Rs 1.52 lakh crore towards agriculture and allied services, this Budget is focusing well on agriculture and rightly so. Also read: FM Sitharaman keeps FY25 capex target unchanged at Rs 11.11 lakh crore in Budget 2024 Renewable Energy The government reiterated its focus on resource efficient economic growth. PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, which was announced in the Interim Budget in February, continues to benefit more than 1 crore households with 300 units of free electricity. The government has also announced facilities for research and development into nuclear energy as well as a Pump Storage System for efficient distribution of renewable energy. How do you read ‘the removal of angel tax for all investor classes’? The majority of the Budget focused on skill development, self employment and entrepreneurship. If we look at the history of angel tax, it was introduced a decade ago on funds raised by unlisted companies as a measure to prevent money laundering in case the company raises funds at a valuation higher than the fair one. We have one of the largest startup ecosystems in the world. With the removal, startups will now have more capital at hand without any stress on tax payments. Is the  cut in corporate tax for foreign companies to 35 percent from 40 percent enough to attract foreign direct investment? A 5 percent reduction in the corporate tax rate might now appear very lucrative but it's a step in the right direction. The step signifies the government's attempt to increase foreign direct investments. The equity FDI inflows in India decreased by 3.49 percent in FY24 to $44.42 billion. The government has also proposed to ease FDI by simplifying the process and also promoting the use of Indian currency for overseas investments.

The Union Budget announcements broadly met analysts' expectations, with the government remaining committed to its fiscal consolidation plan despite pressures from coalition partners. However, the increase in LTCG (Long-Term Capital Gains), STCG (Short-Term Capital Gains) tax rates, and STT (Securities Transaction Tax) was viewed negatively. The index smartly defended the 10 and 20-day EMAs (Exponential Moving Averages) on a closing basis, with 24,000 acting as a sturdy support. Hence, the immediate support is expected to be at 24,200-24,100, whereas 24,600-24,700 is the immediate hurdle zone, followed by 24,850, the crucial hurdle on the higher side. Above this level, all eyes will be on the 25,000 mark in the short term, experts said. The Nifty 50 was rangebound after opening moderately higher, then fell sharply during the budget speech to hit a day's low of 24,074. However, that dip was quickly bought into by participants, leading the index to recover around 405 points from the low before closing 30 points down at 24,479. It formed a bearish candlestick pattern with a long lower shadow, resembling a Hammer-like pattern on the daily charts, signaling an attempt by the bulls to come back from the lower levels. Although the short-term trend of Nifty remains negative with high volatility, the emergence of sharp buying and the formation of a positive candle pattern on Tuesday signal the occurrence of a bullish reversal pattern in the coming sessions, according to Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities. According to him, a sustainable move above 24,650-24,700 could open the next upside towards 24,850-24,900 levels in the near term. ""Immediate support is at 24,100 levels."" The monthly options data indicated that the Nifty may face resistance at 25,000 in the short term, while 24,000 may act as a key support. On the call side, the maximum open interest was observed at the 25,000 strike, followed by 25,500, with maximum writing at the 25,000 strike, and then the 25,200 strike. On the put side, the 24,000 strike holds the maximum open interest, followed by the 23,000 strike, with maximum writing at the 23,900 and 24,000 strikes. Bank Nifty The Bank Nifty declined 502 points, or 0.96 percent, to 51,778 and formed a long bearish candlestick pattern, resembling a Bearish Engulfing sort of candlestick pattern on the daily timeframe, although it managed to defend the previous swing low of July (51,750) on a closing basis. ""The index slipped below the 21-day EMA (52,038), indicating a weakening trend. Sentiment might remain weak in the short term or until the index stays below 52,100. On the lower end, it might move towards 51,200–51,000. On the higher end, resistance is placed at 52,100/52,550,"" Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities said. Meanwhile, volatility dropped considerably on Tuesday, reaching the lowest level since July 5 and falling well below all moving averages, which gave more comfort to bulls.

A Moneycontrol poll of 9 brokerage estimates pegged HUL's fiscal first quarter net profit at Rs 2,512 crore, and revenue at Rs 15,205 crore. HUL's Q1 earnings were expected to remain muted due to an intense heatwave hurting limiting sales, and price cuts taken during the quarter. The FMCG firm's underlying volume growth was at 4 percent during the quarter, it said in an earnings release. Gradual recovery in rural demand continued, while commodity prices remained range-bound, it added.

The home-care segment's underlying sales growth (USG) grew 4 percent and underlying volume growth (UVG) saw high-single digit growth. High single digit volume growth in fabric wash and household care grew mid-single digit on the back of strong premium and mass brands.

This amounts to a sharp 9 percent reduction in duties, which will be passed onto end-consumers and will benefit listed formal jewellery retail players such as Titan Company, Thangamayil Jewellery, and Senco Gold. The duty cut on imports is also positive for jewellery manufacturers like Sky Gold. Raw material price differential between the formal industry (imports via authorised channels) and illegal imports (circumventing duty) will also reduce, considering the steep reduction in imports, which is beneficial for formal and organised jewellery players. The price reduction on the final product to end-consumers will be to the tune of about 6 percent, considering that raw material costs form about 70-75 percent of the overall costs of jewellery companies. Jewellery demand had been affected by a steep increase in gold prices (grew about 20 percent YoY) with leading players such as Titan Company and Senco Gold reporting a high single-digit growth in Q1FY25 compared to the historical robust double-digit growth trend. A reduction in the prices is likely to spur jewellery demand and encourage consumers who were waiting on the sidelines to buy jewellery.

Despite some grumblings about the hike in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax and short-term capital gains (STCG) tax, Jain said the Budget was overall positive. However, Jain is cautious in his outlook, barring some pockets of the market. He is bearish on stocks in the manufacturing, industrial, and defence sectors, irrespective of whether they are public sector or private. Jain's caution stems from the sharp surge in these stocks over the last year.

Talking about the revival in the consumption space, Jain said that the government, with its measures to boost economic growth, lower tax rates, and create jobs, is working in this direction. However, regarding consumption stocks, Jain believes that consumer staples have outperformed for a long time and are still a little expensive. Meanwhile, the consumer discretionary space looks better, even though the stocks in this space are not exactly cheap either.

Experts advised focusing on the 24,200-24,000 levels on the downside for the Nifty 50, and 24,850-25,000 on the higher side, while continuing with a buy-on-dips strategy. Here are the top budget-sensitive stocks to bet on and their levels to watch: Ashish Kyal, CMT, Author Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors REC | CMP: Rs 618.8  REC shows a bullish trend with prices above the Ichimoku Cloud. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates positive momentum as it is reversing back from near 50 levels. Long positions can be created with a stop-loss at Rs 580 and target levels at Rs 660, which is near the upper end of the channel. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 660 Stop-Loss: Rs 580 Petronet LNG | CMP: Rs 341.35  Petronet LNG, a leading player in the LNG infrastructure sector, has shown a bullish trend, with a strong support level at Rs 330. The RSI indicates bullish momentum, and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) suggests a buy signal. The stock also bounced back from the 20-day moving average support. A break above Rs 344 will indicate a buy for a move towards Rs 364, with a stop-loss near Rs 330 levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 364 Stop-Loss: Rs 330 Bharat Dynamics | CMP: Rs 1,493.75  BDL is exhibiting a strong bullish trend, with a recent bounce back above the 50-day moving average (MA). BDL has completed wave 4 and can start wave 5 on the higher side, which can take prices to the previous high near Rs 1,720 levels. We recommend a buy position with a stop-loss at Rs 1,380 (recent swing low) and target levels at Rs 1,720. The long-term trend is turning bullish, with the 20-day MA above the 50-day MA, providing additional upside momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,550, Rs 1,720 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,380 Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments & Securities Hindustan Unilever | CMP: Rs 2,735.3  Hindustan Unilever (HUL) is showcasing a robust 150-week long Cup and Handle pattern on its weekly charts, with a critical neckline at Rs 2,680. During the base formation, volumes remained subdued, but the subsequent rally to the neckline has witnessed substantial volumes, indicating broad-based participation by smart money. Given the positive budget outlook for FMCG companies, HUL emerges as an attractive buy opportunity at Rs 2,750, with a stop-loss set below Rs 2,650 and an ambitious target of Rs 3,000+. The strong technical setup, coupled with favorable macroeconomic factors, positions HUL as a compelling choice for investors looking for growth in the FMCG sector. This setup highlights the stock's potential for significant upside in the coming months. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,000 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,650 Apex Frozen Foods | CMP: Rs 251.25  The upcoming budget is anticipated to emphasize frozen food and logistics sectors, positioning Apex Frozen Foods as a significant beneficiary. Technically, Apex Frozen has formed a 68-week-long Double Bottom pattern with the right bottom emerging on extremely dried-up volumes, indicating strong accumulation. This pattern typically suggests a reversal and a potential uptrend. The stock presents an attractive buy opportunity at the current market price of Rs 251, with an immediate stop-loss on a close below Rs 220. With the budget likely to focus on these sectors, Apex Frozen Foods could see a substantial upside, targeting Rs 345. Investors should keep an eye on this stock for a promising breakout in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 345 Stop-Loss: Rs 220 Snowman Logistics | CMP: Rs 74.37  The upcoming budget is anticipated to heavily emphasize the logistics sector, making Snowman Logistics a standout contender for potential gains. Snowman Logistics is displaying exceptional technical strength, with a 19-week-long Cup and Handle pattern forming on the weekly charts. This classic bullish pattern is backed by volume dynamics—volumes remained subdued during the Cup formation but surged significantly as the stock approached the Handle's neckline. This suggests strong buying interest and accumulation. Given the stock's current market price of Rs 74, investors can consider buying with a stop-loss at Rs 65 and a target of Rs 90. With the expected budget boost to logistics, Snowman Logistics is well-positioned for substantial returns. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 90 Stop-Loss: Rs 65 Navkar Corporation | CMP: Rs 137.58  The upcoming budget is expected to be highly favourable for Navkar Corporation, and the stock's technicals are aligning perfectly with this outlook. Navkar Corp has broken out of a bullish 25-week-long Cup and Handle pattern on the weekly chart, which is a classic indicator of a strong upward trend. The breakout has been accompanied by significant follow-through on substantial volumes, reinforcing the bullish sentiment. This volume surge during the breakout phase signals robust buying interest and institutional accumulation. Currently trading at Rs 137.58, Navkar Corp presents a compelling buy opportunity with a stop-loss below Rs 115. The immediate target for this trade setup is Rs 225, making it a potential high-reward investment in light of the positive budget expectations. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 225 Stop-Loss: Rs 115 Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi Tata Steel | CMP: Rs 160.32  Recently, Tata Steel experienced a significant decline, dropping nearly 22 rupees after forming a Double Top at Rs 180 level. This decline equates to a 12 percent fall, reflecting considerable selling pressure. However, the stock found support around its 150-day Exponential Moving Average (DEMA), indicating a potential stabilization point. On the indicator front, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) has formed an impulsive structure near the 30 oversold zone, which appears attractive at current levels. Therefore, we advise buying Tata Steel in the Rs 158-162 zone, with a target of Rs 175 and a stop-loss of Rs 153 on a daily close basis. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 175 Stop-Loss: Rs 153 Chemplast Sanmar | CMP: Rs 528.85  Recently, Chemplast Sanmar has been in a corrective phase. However, in the previous trading session, it found support at its previous breakout upper band, accompanied by significant volume. Additionally, the daily RSI has reversed from the 50 level on a daily scale, further affirming our bullish stance on the stock. Therefore, we recommend going long in the Rs 520-530 zone, with a target of Rs 600 and a stop-loss placed near Rs 488 on a daily close basis. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 600 Stop-Loss: Rs 488 Hikal | CMP: Rs 342.55  During the past few weeks, Hikal has been in a corrective phase, experiencing a downward adjustment in its price. However, in the previous trading session, the stock found support at the upper band of its previous breakout level, a crucial technical indicator suggesting potential stabilization. This support was further validated by the formation of a Bullish Piercing candlestick pattern, a reliable signal of a possible trend reversal. Additionally, the daily RSI, a momentum oscillator, has reversed from the 50 level on a daily scale, indicating renewed buying interest and further affirming our bullish outlook on the stock. Given these technical indicators, we recommend initiating a long position in the Rs 335-345 zone, with an upside target of Rs 390 and a stop-loss set at Rs 315 on a daily close basis to manage risk. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 390 Stop-Loss: Rs 315 Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Titan, ITC, Adani Ports, NTPC and HCL Tech were among the top gainers in the Nifty Consumer Durables index, which itself was up around 2 percent. The budget has focused on helping the middle class by providing tax relief, including a higher standard deduction for salaried individuals and additional benefits under the new tax regime. This in turn, will boost consumer purchasing power as individuals have more cash in hand. The government's plan to provide 3 crore more houses under the PM Aawas Yojana is expected to boost demand for basic large consumer durables. Efforts are also being made to make it easier to do business in the manufacturing sector. New employment incentives across various sectors will encourage workforce growth and support the Make in India initiative, complementing the existing PLI schemes. Follow our market blog to catch all the updates Ahead of the budget, experts said that simplified compliance, a focus on R&D, and efficient supply chain management are crucial for the success of the consumer durables sector. Any changes in the GST structure were also poised to benefit the sector. Some key benefits for the sector would be reducing import duties on components, such as compressors or semiconductors, according to Elara Securities. This in turn, would bring down production costs and make the final goods cheaper to the end consumers and boost demand. There already exists a PLI scheme for white goods, with the government committing Rs 6,962 crore in investment to 66 beneficiaries under the PLIWG. The government could potentially look at covering additional consumer durables, apart from ACs and LED lights, under a new scheme. This could create new jobs, manufacturing units and increased logistics, said Balasubramanian A, TeamLease Services.

Kedia said that he is bullish on India but bearish on markets. He said that the Budget has little to excite the bulls, especially with the hike in long-term capital gains (LTCG), short term capital gains tax and the increased securities transaction tax (STT) on derivatives trades. Follow our live blog for more Budget updates Kedia sees nothing wrong with the hike in capital gains tax, considering that stock market investors currently enjoy the lowest tax rates. With record profits being generated in the markets, it is understandable that the government wants its share, he said. He compared the situation to good business practices, where prices are raised when demand is high. ""If stock markets are performing exceptionally well, it's reasonable for the government to take an extra pound of flesh,"" he said. Kedia said that fast-moving consumer foods (FMCG) and IT are good hiding places where investors can find reasonable growth. The Union Budget for 2024-25 has hiked LTCG on equities to 12.5 percent from 10 percent, while and short-term capital gains tax to 20 percent from 15 percent earlier. Plus, Security Transaction Tax (STT) on sale of an option in securities was increased from 0.0625 per cent to 0.1 per cent of the option premium. On the sale of a futures in securities, it was increased from 0.0125 per cent to 0.02 per cent of the price at which such futures are traded. When STT is increased, it lowers the volumes because traders would not trade as frequently as they do now as the overall trading costs would go up.

Azeez was responding to a question whether stock prices are factoring in an implied growth that is highly optimistic. Moneycontrol pulled out reverse DCF data from Bloomberg that showed that the prices of more than 250 companies on BSE  500 suggest a 15-20 percent implied growth to eternity when nobody is expecting the nominal GDP growth to be more than 11-12 percent. The numbers suggested that, for a good part of the market, the projection of nominal GDP growth and more have been factored into the stock prices. Azeez agreed that implied growth is a ""beautiful way"" to see if the price of the stock is fair or not and added implied growth of 20-25 percent of large number of businesses is definitely expensive.  Bloomberg data showed that the implied growth of 138 companies was 20-30 percent. He then went on to explain how index-led investing could be causing this distortion. Azeez said, ""Unfortunately or fortunately, market is both valuation and how many people wish to own it."" He cited the example of crypto currency which has zero intrinsic value but which derives its value from demand and supply. A similar phenomena was playing out with stocks of large companies. Azeez said that chairpersons of companies that trade at 70 PE would say the expected growth is not more than 10 percentage but the implied growth would be 25-30 percent for years and that's because a lot of the freefloat is ""gobbled up by the indices"". ""If you look at the top 10 weights of Nifty, if EPFO invests Rs 2 lakh crore, you'll be surprised at the proportion of this that is going into the top 5 weights... Rs 70,000 crore and 80,000 crore needs to go to five stocks.""""So, if EPFO decides to put 15 percentage of its money, it is not going to apply rationality, fundamentals or DCF to understand if the top five weights need NIFTY allocation or not... indices make you gravitate out of the fundamentals,"" he said. ""That's why US market's top stocks are obscenely valued, not because the implied growth or valuation of the top stocks are achievable but because a large potion of the market, the index funds, are ignoring fundamentals,"" he said, adding, ""as we move towards index fund investing we have to keep demand and supply and implied free float in mind."" Azeez said that they track implied free float extensively. He said, ""Most of the free float is gobbled up by index funds which is as good as promoters because they are not going to bring it back to the market."" Azeez said that he believes that there is still some steam left in the liquidity rally in small cap space and therefore they still have around 20 percent exposure to the sector. He said that they will bring this exposure down to 5-10 percent, when they spot a reversal in this trend. The signal for the reversal would be 15 to 20 days of continuous outflow from domestic small-cap funds.

The government's initial MSP for sugar, set at Rs 29 per kg in 2018 and raised to Rs 31 per kg in 2019, is also overdue for another upward revision, Centrum Broking said in a recent research report. Although current market prices are higher than the MSP (Rs 36 in Maharashtra and Rs 39 per kg in UP), raising the MSP would establish a baseline and boost investor confidence in the sector, the brokerage pointed out.

However, the firm retains a positive stance in the medium to long term, driven by the ongoing Ethanol Blending Program (EBP).

Shares of IRCON International, RCF, HUDCO, Mazagon Dock, RVNL, IRFC, NBCC, PFC, IRFC, NALCO, and others declined by up to 6 percent, while BHEL and NTPC gained up to 2 percent on the announcement of a joint venture. PSU companies, being key beneficiaries of government capital expenditure (capex) initiatives, were anticipated to see increased allocations in sectors such as defense, railways, and infrastructure. However, the government maintained capex unchanged at Rs 11.11 lakh crore for this fiscal year. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog The government plans to maintain strong fiscal support for infrastructure, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said while presenting the Union Budget. The government intends to continue substantial public spending to boost growth while pursuing fiscal consolidation. Specifically in railways, the interim budget planned significant upgrades to infrastructure, including converting 40,000 standard railway bogies to Vande Bharat standards to enhance passenger safety, comfort, and convenience. However, no specific allocation was provided for the railways sector, leading to declines of up to 5 percent in related stocks RVNL, IRCTC, and RITES on July 23.

""As far as the allocation to Ministry of Defence is concerned, I thank the Finance Minister for giving the highest allocation, which is 12.9  percent of total Budget of GoI for FY 2024-25. The capital outlay of Rs 1,72,000 Crore will further strengthen the capabilities of Armed Forces,"" said Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on social media platform X.

The Nifty Realty index was down 2.6 percent in the afternoon trading on July 23. DLF stock fell more than 6 percent to  day’s low of Rs 778.2 over the Budget 2024 announcement. The Finance Minister, in a bid to rationalise the capital gains tax regime, changed the Long Term Capital Gain tax rate to 12.5 percent across all financial and non-financial assets. This would result in the LTCG tax on property falling from 20 percent earlier. Benchmark indices fell, with the Nifty 50 down 0.6 percent, or 136 points, and Sensex down 350 points. Other realty stocks tanked too. Macrotech Developers was down 3.6 percent, Godrej Properties down 5 percent, Prestige Estates down 5.3 percent, Phoenix Mills down 2.1 percent. The indexation benefit adds the inflation rate to the asset’s purchase price. At the time of the sale of the asset, this means a higher purchase price, resulting in a lower capital gain -- or even zero in some cases, eventually resulting in a tax benefit. Without indexation, the gain would be calculated on the actual purchase price, potentially resulting in a higher tax outgo. “This proposal may not sooth taxpayers goosebumps as the proposal, in the garb of simplification, largely skews towards heightening tax rates in certain instances,” said Sandeep Jhunjhunwala, M&A Tax Partner, Nangia Andersen LLP, regarding the overall LTCG proposals made in the Budget 2024.

The STT on sale of equity options will now be levied at 0.1 percent of the option premium, up from 0.0625 percent; and at the rate of 0.02 percent on sale of futures as against 0.0125 percent now. Stocks plunged as Nirmala Sitharaman raised taxes on equity and derivatives trading. She also increased short-term capital gains and long-term capital gains taxes. The Nifty 50 index fell as much as 1.8 percent at the day’s low, shortly after the Finance Minister announced the levies. The index partially recovered shortly thereafter. Long-term capital gains across listed and unlisted universe will now be taxed at a uniform rate of 12.5 percent. This is an increase from 10 percent at present. The STT changes will be applicable from 1 October, while the Short Term Capital Gains and Long Term Capital Gains tax changes will be applicable effective today. The move to raise STT, which is levied on the value of securities traded, is a step towards curbing derivatives trading by retail investors after a series of warnings from the finance ministry, the Reserve Bank of India, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, SEBI chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch, and others over the past few months. The National Stock Exchange (NSE) and BSE are the world’s top two bourses in terms of F&O volume and the turnover has reached such levels that the combined turnover of the two Indian stock exchanges accounted for more than 80 percent of the global turnover in the month of April. The Economic Survey 2024 released earlier this week said that such speculative trading as derivatives has no place in a low per capita income country like India, warning that retail investors may face considerable losses in F&O trading. Further, it compared derivatives trading to gambling. “Derivatives trading holds the potential for outsized gains. Thus, it caters to humans' gambling instincts and can augment income if profitable,” it said, warning investors that “Globally, derivatives trading loses money for the investors, for the most part.” Earlier this month, Moneycontrol reported that a SEBI working committee on F&O has proposed measures to curb the rapid growth in derivatives volume. These include increasing the minimum lot size of derivative contracts to Rs 20 lakh-Rs 30 lakh from the current Rs 5 lakh, restricting weekly options to one expiry per stock exchange per week, and limiting the number of strike prices for options contracts. The government and regulators seem to be worried about widespread losses arising from heightened trading in futures and options by retail investors, who may not fully understand the risks or the nature of such trading.

It defines the parameters by which a fund that invests in and operates from India can be exempted from taxation. ""With a view to reduce litigation and provide certainty in international taxation, we will expand the scope of safe harbour rules and make them more attractive,"" Sitharaman said in her Union Budget speech on July 23. While no details on how this clause would be expanded were given, this news will be welcomed by industry insiders. Capital market participants met the finance minister on June 20, asking for a review of the safe harbour clause under Section 9A of the Income Tax Act. According to them, the clause, which was put in place in 2015 to encourage offshore funds to invest in India, needed more refining. Under this clause, a fund will be exempt if it does not have a business connection in India. To establish that there is no business connection or tax residence in India, the fund and the fund manager have to meet certain conditions like threshold for aggregate participation and timeline for raising the minimum corpus. According to capital-market insiders, this clause needs to be expanded for various reasons. For one, there is a threshold set for individual investors' holding in the fund. ""The aggregate participation or investment in the fund, directly or indirectly, by persons resident in India does not exceed 5 percent of the corpus of the fund,"" it said. Fund managers say that it is difficult to monitor if this threshold is being breached on a continuous basis, especially if an Indian entity is participating indirectly through separately set-up entities. They are also demanding that the threshold be raised from 5 percent to 10 percent. Second, funds want the timeline set for raising the minimum corpus— of a monthly average of Rs 100-crore corpus—extended. The funds now have a year to raise this amount.  They want this time period to be extended to three, if not five, years. Third, they want the threshold of profit sharing with fund managers to be revised. The fund managers and connected entities cannot take more than 20 percent of the profits made by the fund through transactions done through the fund manager. Experts pointed out that some of the provisions under the 9A IT Act do not apply to funds set up in Singapore and therefore funds set up through the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in GIFT City are at a disadvantage.

The interim budget had estimated the fertiliser subsidy requirement for FY25 at Rs 1.64 lakh crore, which was lower than Rs 1.89 lakh crore for FY24. However, with raw material prices having fallen, investors too were not even expecting any increase in fertiliser subsidies. Rather, most anticipated the finance minister to stick to the previous estimated subsidy bill. Fertiliser companies struggled with sub-par earnings in FY24, primarily due to weak prices, muted demand, and an influx of low-cost Chinese inventory in the global market. As a result, most companies in the sector experienced a sharp decline in profitability, with both net profit and revenue suffering under the pressure of weak demand and falling prices. However, there have been signs of recovery in recent quarters. Demand is expected to improve in the second half of the current fiscal year, coinciding with the onset of the Rabi sowing season. This positive outlook has led to a rebound in the sector, with stocks such as Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore (FACT), Chambal Fertilisers and Chemicals, Deepak Fertilisers, and Coromandel International rising between 17-45 percent from their lows in 2024.

Housing finance stocks slip on profit-taking after urban housing Budget boost,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/housing-finance-stocks-slip-on-profit-taking-after-urban-housing-budget-boost-12773628.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 01:35 PM","Shares of LIC Housing Finance, Can Fin Homes, HUDCO, PNB Housing Finance, Home First, and Aptus Value Housing fell by up to 1 percent as investors chose to book profits on the Budget announcement of a Rs 10 lakh crore boost for urban housing. Shares of housing finance companies (HFCs) had rallied significantly in the run up to the Budget. The Budget also announced expansion of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) by adding 3 crore more houses to the scheme. Finance Minister, in her 2024 Budget speech, outlined that Urban 2.0 will address the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle-class families with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore. The plan also includes provisions for interest subsidies to offer loans at affordable rates. Of the 3 crore additional houses under PMAY, 2 crore will be allocated to rural areas. In the interim Budget presented in February, Rs 80,671 crore was allocated for PMAY. For 2023-24, the government initially earmarked Rs 79,590 crore, but this was revised to Rs 54,103 crore in updated estimates.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY scheme aims to provide durable houses with essential amenities to all eligible urban beneficiaries. Experts consider PMAY a vital initiative for addressing housing shortages in both urban and rural areas. The scheme offers crucial credit-linked subsidies, facilitating homeownership and improved living conditions for eligible families. Piyush Gupta, Managing Director of Capital Markets & Investment Services at Colliers India, noted, ""The Rs 10 lakh crore allocation for rental housing is a significant boost for the real estate sector, supporting the goal of building 3 crore houses across urban and rural areas. This will spur infrastructure development in satellite cities and create numerous job opportunities."" Despite this, the affordable housing segment has struggled since the COVID-19 pandemic, while larger, more expensive homes have sold more rapidly. Data from real estate consultancy Anarock reveals that the share of affordable housing sales in India dropped from over 38 percent in 2019 to 20 percent this year. The supply of affordable homes also fell from nearly 40 percent in 2019 to 18 percent this year due to low demand. Over the past decade, housing finance companies outpaced banks in growth during the first five years (FY13-18), leading to market share gains. Outstanding individual housing loans in India grew at a healthy CAGR of 15 percent over the past decade, reaching Rs 30 lakh crore as of September 2023.

At such a pivotal point, industry stakeholders believed that support from the central government would be crucial to help maintain the growth momentum. Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra are major players in the industry. The proponents of EVs argued that shifting focus away from EVs could have possibly slowed India's progress toward its climate goals and stifled its growth. Data from the Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles (SMEV) showed that total four-wheeler EV sales stood at 90,432 units in FY24, a mammoth 90.3 percent rise from FY 23 where total sales stood at 47,499.

In the Budget, the Finance Minister announced a reduction on Basic Custom Duty on gold and silver from 10 percent to 6 percent and Agriculture Infrastructure & Development Cess (AIDC) from 5 percent to 1 percent.

"Higher LTCG, STCG rates implemented with immediate effect; higher STT on F&O from October 1",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/markets-plunge-as-budget-hikes-ltcg-stcg-taxes-income-from-buyback-of-shares-12775546.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 02:29 PM","If there was one thing that the market did not want finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to do, it was hiking taxes that directly impact the stock markets -- long term capital gains (LTCG), short term capital gains (STCG), and securities transaction tax (STT). The finance minister, however,  did exactly the same and made the worst fears of the market come true. While presenting the Union budget, the finance minister increased the long-term capital gains tax from the current 10 percent to 12.5 percent while also increasing the short-term capital gains tax from the current 15 percent to 20 percent. More importantly, the increased tax rates will be implemented with immediate effect. As per the Finance Bill, the new rates will come into effect on July 23. ""Short term gains on specified financial assets shall henceforth attract a tax rate of 20 per cent instead of 15 per cent, while that on all other financial assets and non-financial assets shall continue to attract the applicable tax rate. Long term gains on all financial and non-financial assets, on the other hand, will attract a tax rate of 12.5 per cent,"" she said. Further, STT on derivatives has been increased to 0.02 percent, though the new rate will come into effect from October 1, as per the Finance Bill. ""I have a couple of proposals for deepening the tax base. First, Security Transactions Tax on futures and options of securities is proposed to be increased to 0.02 per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively,"" said the minister while adding that income received on buy back of shares will be taxed the hands of the recipient. There was an immediate knee-jerk reaction as the 30-share Sensex fell nearly 1300 points to touch the day's low of 79,224 though it has partially recouped the losses since then. Currently, capital gains tax in India is based on the holding period and asset type. For equities, long-term capital gain (LTCG) over Rs 1 lakh is taxed at 10 percent after a 12-month holding period, while short-term capital gains (STCG) is taxed at 15 percent. In the derivatives segment, STT on the sale of options is 0.0625 percent, which is paid by the seller. On the sale of options in which the option is exercised, it is 0.125 percent, which is payable by the buyer. And on sale of futures, it is 0.0125 percent, which is payable by the seller. ""From the markets perspective the raising of STCG to 20% and LTCG to 12.5% is a body blow,"" says Sanjay Sinha, Founder at Citrus Advisors. ""We need to brace ourselves for a negative reaction in the short term. In the light of all the concerns raised about the hyper active interest in the F&O segment it is not surprising that the STT on F&O has been raised 5 times from 0.02% to 0.1%. Hopefully this will moderate the frenzy in this space,"" he added. Similarly, Sanjay Sanghvi, Partner, Khaitan & Co is of the view that the increase in tax on both, long term capital gains and also short term capital gains, is a bit disappointing and could have been avoided. ""There is a 25 percent increase in LTCG though fortunately the government has retained the one-year holding period requirement. Increase in STT on derivatives is a way to address some of the recent concerns. While one will have to see the fine print, it is believed that the budget has also removed the indexation benefit available in a property transaction,"" added Sanghvi In a similar context, Vaibhav Porwal, Co-founder, Dezerv, said that the increase in STCG and LTCG tax signal a significant shift and while the market's initial reaction may seem bearish, these changes will ultimately foster a more stable and mature investment environment. ""The market is currently responding with a short-term perspective, particularly concerning the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) adjustments in derivatives. This will undoubtedly impact the profitability of frequent traders. However, we encourage investors to look beyond immediate market reactions and consider the long-term benefits of a tax structure that promotes patient capital,” he added.

On the sale of a futures in securities, it was increased from 0.0125 per cent to 0.02 per cent of the price at which such futures are traded. When STT is increased, it lowers the volumes because traders would not trade as frequently as they do now as the overall trading costs would go up. Madhusudan Kela in a conversation with CNBC TV18 said that the increase in STCG, LTCG taxation, and STT on F&O was not in line with expectation of market participants. He further said, ""The government wants the markets to cool off. While the fiscal math was adding, this wasn’t the basic expectation of market. Already the markets have run off very high in the last few months, some kind of a correction because of this is not overruled and that’s what markets are showing now."" Kirang Gandhi, personal financial mentor said, the increase in LTCG, STCG, and STT, has caused some market instability as investors react to the higher taxes. He added that while the goal is to raise more revenue, these changes might discourage short-term trading and make long-term investments more attractive, potentially changing how the market behaves in the coming months.

14 tech stocks in focus as FM Sitharaman gears up to table Budget 2024,https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/14-tech-stocks-in-focus-as-fm-sitharaman-gears-up-to-table-budget-2024-article-12775488.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 10:30 AM","As Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to start her Budget speech in less than an hour, all eyes are on some tech stocks that stand to be impacted the most by the announcements she makes. Here are the 14 technology sector stocks that should be tracked today: TCS, Infosys and Wipro The IT services bellwether and the country’s largest software exporter continues to trade strongly on the stock exchange having seen a price uptick of nearly 26 percent in the past one year. Share prices of Wipro and Infosys, the two Bengaluru-headquartered IT service majors, have jumped over 25 percent in the last year, because of the sentiment that potential recovery in the sector might be around the corner. The Street’s optimism on Artificial intelligence and generative AI bringing demand and innovation for the IT sector despite macro challenges has been a major factor driving this. Any regulatory updates, new initiatives announced during the budget to boost India’s AI mission and skilling will be watched out for as this will directly impact companies like TCS and its customers spending millions of dollars at this point build Gen AI use cases. Moreover, regulatory clarity and incentives would also mean more MNCs setting up their Global Capability Centers (GCCs) in the country – another segment of customers for IT companies as well. Government-level initiatives and investments coming from GCCs were also highlighted in detail in the Economic Survey 2024. Zomato As the consumer tech major plans to increase its focus on the live entertainment sector, apart from expanding its quick commerce and food delivery arms, the company's stock may benefit from any Budget announcements that give a push to consumption such as lowering of income tax rates. The stock has risen by 169 percent in the last one year and is currently trading at Rs 218.44 apiece on the NSE. It opened today at Rs 222.5 apiece. Dixon Technologies Electronics manufacturing services (EMS) stocks have seen significant growth in recent years, delivering outstanding returns for investors. Dixon Technologies, for instance, has soared by 2,443.18 percent over the past five years, surging from Rs 376.87 in July 2019 to Rs 11,210 currently. The stock opened at Rs 11,430 on the NSE on July 23. The company stands to benefit further from government incentives aimed at boosting manufacturing and electronics production. As India strives for self-reliance, the upcoming budget is expected to further incentivise local electronics production. Delhivery The logistics unicorn's stock price has not performed well since its listing in May 2022. It has dropped 4 percent in the last one year as the company has struggled with profitability. Any Budget announcements that give a push to sectors like e-commerce, automobiles, MSMEs -- which are its main customer segments -- may boost Delhivery's stock price. Paytm Any enhanced UPI subsidies as well as for digital payments could bring good news to Paytm, which is struggling with lower payment margin since the RBI curbs on its associate company Paytm Payments Bank Limited. Ideaforge Technology Founded by three IIT Bombay graduates (CEO Ankit Mehta, VP Ashish Bhat, VP Rahul singh) other than the company's CFO Vipul Joshi, this Mumbai-based drone company has been one of the early adopters of drone ecosystem in India. The company's results for the FYQ1 2024 indicated significant growth and improvement in several key metrics compared to the same period in the previous year. Technical indicators suggest that the stock has good financial performance alongside good to expensive valuation, but lacks price momentum. As on NSE, ideaForge on July 23, opened at Rs 825.25 per share. With its key customers in the defence sector, traders would be keenly observing at this year's budget for allocation in relevant ministries, any sort of policy announcements and so on. The company has also been spending significant amount of its budget into research and development, and has plans to venture into the US market going forward. EaseMyTrip Travel and tourism has been one of the focus areas of the government and travel aggregators like EaseMyTrip are likely to benefit from the government's measures to boost domestic tourism. Key events this year like the Indian Premier League (IPL) led to a 20-25 percent surge in flight bookings while hotel bookings increased by 15-20 percent on EaseMyTrip. However, shares of the company have been in the red and down 4 percent in the last 12 months on the NSE. It currently trades at Rs 40 a piece on the exchanges. In the March quarter of FY24, the online travel aggregator had slipped into red as it reported a loss of Rs 15 crore as against a profit of Rs 31 crore during the same period a year ago. This is the first time the company incurred a loss in at least three years. Nykaa Nykaa has seen its revenue and profits be largely range bound over the past year or so. In the last 12 months, share prices of FSN e-commerce, the parent company of Nykaa, have gained only around 22.5 percent and still trades below its IPO price. While the increase is decent, it is behind expectations that investors have from new-age tech companies. Any relief in income tax, which leaves more disposable income in the hands of people, will likely be a positive cue for the beauty and personal care brand. The shares were changing hands at Rs 176.1 apiece in early trade on July 23 (around 9:30 am) on the BSE. Nazara Nazara Technologies has seen its stock rise 34 percent in the past year. The stock opened at Rs 877.95 on NSE on July 23. The diversified gaming and sports media firm could benefit from any measure that supports game development, infrastructure or growth of esports in the country. It could also benefit from any measure introduced to bring better tax clarity to real-money gaming industry. Insurtech: PB Fintech, Go Digit Mega changes are expected to take place in insurance sector in the upcoming Budget 2024, including introduction of bill amending the Insurance Act, 1938, aiming for 'Insurance for All by 2047', and the much-awaited composite license for insurers to provide life, health and general insurance policies. Further, Indian insurance companies are eyeing multiple tax exemptions from the central government in the upcoming Budget to enhance attractiveness and affordability of insurance products, thereby promoting greater penetration nationwide. Shares of PB Fintech, which recently received the nod from the IRDAI to upgrade its license from a direct insurance broker to a composite insurance broker, and its newly-listed peer Go Digit may benefit from the announcements. Honasa Consumer Honasa Consumer, which made its public market debut in November last year, has outperformed expectations and already gained around 36 percent in around nine months, with more upside on the horizon. The share currently trades at Rs 458.10 apiece on the NSE. It may further gain if the government announces measures that will leave more disposable income in the hands of people outside the metro cities as a bulk of Honasa’s sales come from non-metro cities. Honasa runs brands like Mamaearth. Further, any policies that will be favourable for sellers on Amazon, Flipkart and other marketplaces will be a positive for the stock as the company is heavily reliant on e-commerce for its sales.

Private capex triggers are in place, but what is lacking is animal spirit, which has to come from outside the Budget.

Prashant Jain, 3P India Equity Fund This is a time for the market to tone down expectations, as the big catch up of corporate profitability is behind us, going forward we may see low-teen (12-14%) kind of earnings growth in the near term. The government needs to be doing more of what it has been doing. Private capex will go up but it will take time, however, we are in the right direction. We have been a buyer on private banks, capex and discretionary consumption and IT. The electronics sector needs a stronger eco-system. Stability in taxation will be welcome, and the outlook seems great. There is enough fiscal room to not disturb the consolidation path. Ridham Desai, Morgan Stanley Large private banks are looking attractive and the market may not have priced in the upside entirely. The IT space could also see some gains driven by the AI theme. We like Auto and Auto Ancillaries with in consumption, and also the Retail space. Govt must also offer support to key sectors like defence, and manufacturing-oriented themes. We have the setup in place to encourage private capex and cycle has started, it should gain momentum. Nilesh Shah, Kotak AMC This Budget has to achieve the trinity of impossible - fiscal prudence, infrastructure investment and consumption boost.

Varun Beverages Ltd (VBL): VBL is expected to outperform other FMCG peers in the beverage category, benefiting from improved rural infrastructure and connectivity, which could boost demand for its products. Also Read: Budget 2024 Live Updates Market outlook The upcoming Union Budget 2024 is expected to focus on social sector spending and welfare schemes, which could boost rural consumption. Key measures such as improving rural infrastructure, enhancing rural connectivity, and increasing capital expenditure are anticipated to support this growth. Additionally, incentives to increase domestic production of essential commodities could help lower raw material costs for FMCG companies, enabling them to reduce prices without impacting margins. Industry experts are optimistic about a cyclical recovery in rural consumption in FY25, led by higher allocations for social sector schemes and continued growth in public capex. This recovery is expected to benefit blue-chip large-cap consumer staples players, as well as companies expanding their geographical footprints and focusing on discretionary categories.

Tweaks to capital gains tax could be a sentiment dampener: Experts,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tweaks-to-capital-gains-tax-could-be-a-sentiment-dampener-experts-12775461.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 10:23 AM","AMFI has suggested that the LTCG on listed equity shares or units of equity-oriented fund schemes, held for more than one year and up to three years, be subjected to LTCG tax at the rate of 10 percent on capital gains exceeding Rs 2 lakh in a financial year. Follow our market blog for live updates The discussion around capital gains is complex, says Radhika Gupta, CEO, Edelweiss Mutual Fund, in conversation with Moneycontrol. On expectations, Gupta added, ""If you say that long-term capital gains tax, which is 10 percent after one year, becomes 10 percent after three years, that is one speculation but if you say that long-term capital gains tax is going to become 20 percent after one year, or is going to become marginal after one year, I think that is a very meaningful amount,"" she added. Gupta stressed the need for consistency in tax policy. ""This constant flip-flop in tax policy, I don't think helps anyone,"" she said. Dhirendra Kumar, CEO, Value Research added that capital gains should not be taxed because their appreciation or optimism in the short term is largely a function of corporate income. ""Consumers are not directly paying for this, but from a market standpoint, it is beneficial. The scale of money coming in from small capital gains may not be as significant as larger capital gains,"" he said adding that the implications of taxing capital gains can impact market disinvestment as FII investments or disinvestments are counterbalanced by mutual fund investors. ""Taxing capital gains acts more as a sentiment spoiler than a significant source of immediate revenue,"" Kumar said. Gupta also noted that there was scope for taxation on F&O .  ""It doesn't do anything in terms of capital formation. It is not funding growth capital for the country. And the investor can move more than what they put in. So, I would be pretty surprised if there was nothing towards the intent of F&O taxation,"" she added noting that she hopes there is realisation on the difference between productive liquidity, which is liquidity in the equity markets, long-term cash equity liquidity, liquidity like SIPs, versus what is going on in F&O.

Energy stocks in focus ahead of Union Budget today,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/energy-stocks-in-focus-ahead-of-union-budget-today-12775520.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 10:24 AM","Ahead of the Union Budget for 2024-25, energy stocks, which are on a dream run on the bourses this year, are in the limelight. Stocks like Adani Power, Coal India, JSW Energy, NTPC, Tata Power, NHPC, SJVN, and Suzlon Energy are shining brightest. Shares of Adani Power, Coal India, JSW Energy, NTPC, and Tata Power have surged over 200 percent in 2024. NHPC and SJVN have gained over 50 percent, while Suzlon Energy is up 20 percent this year and nearly 180 percent over the past year. Analysts are of the view that power stocks have surged, with many penny stocks becoming multi-baggers. Since July 2023, narratives of power shortages, capacity addition, and sector reforms have boosted valuations. The weakest monsoon in 122 years increased demand and power prices from July to October 2023, further driving stock values. In the Interim Budget 2024 on February 1, the Centre allocated at least Rs 28,352 crore to power sector schemes, including renewables, a 50 percent increase from the revised estimate of Rs 18,945 crore in 2023-24. Power sector initiatives saw a 40 percent hike in allocation, from Rs 11,359 crore to Rs 15,861 crore. The power sector anticipates a focus on renewable energy projects and financial support for power distribution companies (discoms) in the full Union Budget on July 23. To reach India's goal of 50 percent non-fossil fuel power capacity by 2030, the country needs to add 50 GW of renewable energy every year for the next five years. The country is now adding about 15 GW a year, according to experts. India's energy needs are expected to grow 2-2.5 times by 2047, driven by the growing economy, but the renewable energy sector still faces challenges, according to the Economic Survey 2023-24 presented on July 22. In 2022-23, fossil fuels dominated India's energy mix, accounting for nearly 84 percent, including coal, oil, and natural gas. However, the electricity sector has shifted significantly towards renewables, with non-fossil power capacity rising from around 32 percent in April 2014 to 45.4 percent in May 2024.

16 Infrastructure stocks to watch ahead of Union Budget 2024,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/16-infrastructure-stocks-to-watch-ahead-of-union-budget-2024-12775477.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 10:02 AM","As anticipation builds around the Union Budget 2024 due later today, market participants are closely eyeing a selection of infrastructure stocks that stand to benefit from key announcements regarding an enhanced capital expenditure. The government's continued focus on capital expenditure (capex) and infrastructure development, despite a slow start to the new fiscal year due to elections, has set the stage for significant opportunities in this sector. Here are the top infrastructure stocks to watch ahead of the budget. Infrastructure stocks to watch ABB: With a robust order book of Rs 8,400 crores, ABB is expected to benefit from government focus areas such as the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, renewable energy, power, and water infrastructure. Siemens: Holding an impressive order book of Rs 47,000 crores, Siemens is well-positioned to capitalise on investments in railway safety and modernisation, along with its involvement in power and renewable energy projects. Larsen & Toubro (L&T): With an outstanding order book of Rs 4.76 lakh crores, L&T provides strong revenue visibility for the next 1 to 2 years. The company is expected to benefit from increased spending on infrastructure projects across various sectors, including railways and power. Cummins, BHEL, and Hitachi Energy: These companies are likely to see gains from government investments in power and water infrastructure, bolstered by the PLI scheme. KEC International, Kalpataru Projects, and Skipper: Highlighted as top picks by InCred Capital, these stocks are set to benefit from a structural shift towards investments in power transmission and distribution, data centres, and semiconductor manufacturing. Titagarh Wagons, Jupiter, and BEML: Beneficiaries of rolling stock orders in the railway sector, including electric locomotives and metro coaches, these companies are expected to see continued growth. Tata Projects: Urging the government to encourage private capital expenditure, Tata Projects stands to gain significantly from a holistic growth approach in the construction sector. Anant Raj: Potential incentives for digital infrastructure and smart cities in the budget could benefit this company. Man Infraconstruction and Tarc Ltd: A renewed focus on affordable housing schemes in rural markets could positively impact these urban developers. High valuations remain a concern Industry analysts note that the capital goods segment is trading at high valuations, with major companies seeing a premium of 50-60 percent compared to long-term averages. Despite this, the strong export and domestic markets in power, renewables, and transmission justify these valuations. For instance, the power equipment sector expects significant capex in transmission, with companies increasing their capacity in anticipation of 12-13 percent volume growth over the next 2-3 years.

PVR Inox stock slips as brokerages cut target prices after subdued Q1 results,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/pvr-inox-stock-slips-as-brokerages-cut-target-prices-after-subdued-q1-results-12775471.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 09:35 AM","PVR Inox shares fell nearly a percent on July 23 as brokerages slashed target prices on the stock after the company reported a weak set of numbers for the fiscal first quarter (Q1FY25). PVR INOX's net loss widened 119 percent on-year to Rs 180 crore and net sales fell 8.75 percent YoY to Rs. 1,190.70 crore due to general elections, and a Cricket-heavy season which resulted in a 13 percent YoY drop in movie releases. Weak ticketing and Food and beverage (F&B) revenue, coupled with operating deleverage, led to a net loss of Rs 140 crore, according to analysts. Absence of tent-pole content impacted admits, occupancy and average ticket price (ATP). The rise in Opex/Screen pulled down core margins further. However, Kalki’s strong performance suggests movie-going remains solely content-driven. A strong line-up of movies across languages means the next two quarters should be sequentially stronger for PVR INOX, according to analysts at JM Financial. Notwithstanding a weak start, management believes FY25 admits could be similar to FY24’s, underscoring its confidence in the content pipeline. Receding impact of Hollywood strike should help normalise release calendar next year, translating into more consistent financial performance. That should help realise revenue synergies of the merger. Management’s calibrated approach on screen addition, gradual pivot to asset-light model and planned divestment of non-core properties should aid free cash flow, said JM Financial.

However, it trimmed the target price to Rs 2,040 from Rs 2,070 earlier. Stable occupancies, healthy recovery in advertising revenues, increased risk of rising scale, and the traction of movie releases over OTT platforms continue to be the key monitorables according to Motilal Oswal. ""Maintaining occupancy and traction in ad revenues amid an increasing threat from deep-pocketed OTT players remains a key catalyst for growth,"" the brokerage said as it maintained a 'neutral' rating on the stock with a reduced target price of Rs 1,450 per share. With its primary focus on the movie exhibition business, the combined entity (PVR+INOX) will continue to ramp up margin-accretive segments such as F&B revenues and advertisement revenues, which in Nuvama's view will drive the EBITDA expansion for the business. Aggressive expansion and focus on innovation will deliver growth for the business over the longer term, the brokerage noted as it held a 'buy' call on the stock but revised the target price downwards to Rs 1,855 from Rs 1,995 earlier.

That is the question. When Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman rises to present her seventh successive budget today, the markets will be waiting with bated breath to see if she can repeat the feat she achieved in 2021 when the Sensex jumped over 2,300 points or five percent – the best-ever post-budget reaction seen in over two decades. Similar to 2021 when the budget was presented in the backdrop of an unprecedented global pandemic – the expectations this year are quite high, with experts pinning their hopes on the newly-formed government continuing its focus on core sectors such as infrastructure, defence and manufacturing, along with a renewed thrust on new-age segments too. From the markets perspective, however, all eyes will be on announcements, if any, related to long term capital gains (LTCG) tax and also Securities Transaction Tax (STT) as these two directly impact the investor community. For more details, follow our Live Blog Experts have been unanimous in saying that any negative surprises related to these taxes would adversely impact the sentiments of the markets that have been volatile with an upward bias in the recent past. Any negative surprise in areas like income tax, LTCG, STCG, or STT could have a short-term negative impact, says Krishna Appala, Senior Research Analyst, Capitalmind Research. This assumes significance as a section of the market has already suggested to the government that STT for high frequency algo traders in the derivatives segment should be hiked. Also Read: Budget 2024: FM urged to hike STT on HFT F&O trades to shield retail investors In the last three months, the Sensex has gained nearly 12 percent or 8,620 points. The broader Nifty has been up 12.37 percent. On Tuesday, however, when the markets open for trading, it would be following two successive days of losses as concerns related to high valuations and positive triggers going ahead are already making a large section of the market nervous. Incidentally, CLSA’s 'India Bull Bear Index' is currently showing 92 percent bullishness – the highest ahead of any Union Budget in the past 15 years – but the global financial major has also expressed a word of caution, stating that such an extreme sentiment reading coupled with stretched valuations make the domestic market setup extremely vulnerable going into the budget. It is interesting to note that while FM Nirmala Sitharaman has presented six budgets till date, the markets have reacted positively on three instances while dipping on the other three occasions. The worst was witnessed in 2020 when the markets fell by over two percent on the day of the budget. Meanwhile, in terms of stock-specific action, the so-called Modi stocks will be in the limelight after the recent subdued performance. The 'Modi stocks' consist mainly of state-owned companies such as PFC, REC, HAL, SAIL, BPCL; banking names like SBI, PNB, Canara Bank, as well as infrastructure companies and those belonging to corporate groups like Reliance Industries, Adani Enterprises, and Adani Ports & SEZ. While the real challenge for the Modi 3.0 government would be to balance three key metrics - economic growth, inflation and fiscal consolidation – the Economic Survey released on Monday had its share of bearish statements as well. “If equity market valuations significantly exceed the real economy's capacity, it signals market instability rather than resilience,” stated the Survey report. To sum up, there have been a total of 29 budgets presented since 2000 and the markets have gained on 13 occasions while losing ground on the other 16. But, more importantly, the Indian stock markets have grown 15x in the last 24 years.

Budget 2024:Home Financiers advocate for enhanced PMAY scheme and housing loan subsidies,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/home-financiers-advocate-for-enhanced-pmay-scheme-and-housing-loan-subsidies-12775259.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 08:31 AM","Affordable housing stocks, including LIC Housing Finance, Can Fin Homes, HUDCO, PNB Housing Finance, Home First, Aptus Value Housing, and Aavas Financiers, saw gains of up to 2 percent on July 22, as anticipation builds ahead of the Budget presentation. Investors hope for continued government support, with expectations of increased funding for the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) and additional subsidies for housing loan borrowers in Budget 2025. Should these expectations be met, it could provide a significant boost to the housing finance sector and positively impact stocks in this segment. Morgan Stanley analysts highlight that the housing finance industry is looking for increased funding in the PMAY-Gramin scheme, which could drive demand for homes in tier-2 and tier-3 cities. The revamped PMAY-G scheme is anticipated to raise cash support to Rs 2.3-2.4 lakh per housing unit, up from Rs 1.2-1.3 lakh in the previous scheme, to address rising construction costs. ALSO READ: Budget 2024: Realty firms eye tax relief, redefining of affordable housing The industry is also advocating for a revision in income tax policies. They are seeking an increase in the deduction limit for interest paid on home loans to at least Rs 3 lakh. Additionally, experts are calling for a redefinition of affordable housing. The current definition includes homes with a carpet area up to 90 square meters in non-metropolitan cities and 60 square meters in major cities, valued up to Rs 45 lakh. There is a push to raise this limit to at least Rs 60-65 lakh in non-metro cities and Rs 85 lakh in metropolitan areas to facilitate further construction and extend benefits to more customers. The affordable housing sector has struggled since the Covid-19 pandemic, while the demand for larger and more expensive homes has surged. According to Anarock, the share of affordable housing sales in India dropped from over 38 percent in 2019 to 20 percent this year. The overall supply of affordable homes also decreased from nearly 40 percent in 2019 to 18 percent this year. Over the past decade, housing finance companies have outpaced banks in growth, with outstanding individual housing loans in India growing at a healthy CAGR of 15 percent and reaching Rs 30 lakh crore as of September 2023.

JK Cement stock gains after brokerages raise target prices on positive Q1 results,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jk-cement-stock-may-gain-after-brokerages-raise-target-prices-on-positive-q1-results-12775404.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 09:19 AM","Shares of JK Cement gained on July 23 as brokerages raised target prices on the stock after the company reported a 67 percent on-year increase in its consolidated net profit to Rs 184.82 crore for the fiscal first quarter (Q1FY25). The cement maker's revenue from operations edged up 1.62 percent to Rs 2,807.57 crore. Citi has issued a sell call on JK Cement. However, the brokerage raised the target price to Rs 4,400 per share from Rs 3,550 earlier. The company's Q1 EBITDA increased by 19 percent on-year, driven by higher sales volumes and lower costs, which contributed to an outperformance compared to estimates, according to Citi. The company is on track to expand its capacity to 30 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by FY26, up from the current 24 mtpa, with plans to reach 44 mtpa by FY30, the international brokerage said. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action However, industry demand growth is expected to be softer compared to recent years, and with a muted pricing environment, the next phase of capacity expansion is more than a year away, limiting potential upside, said Citi in its note. JK Cement is currently trading at an enterprise value per tonne (EV/t) of $140, compared to other regional cement producers at $70-110/t, Citi added. JK Cement delivered 6 percent YoY volume growth in the April-June quarter with elections and extended heatwaves playing spoilsport. EBITDA was hit by lower-than-anticipated blended realisations, owing to a consistent rollback of prices. However, analysts at Nuvama like the company for its consistent volume growth, capex plans, improvement in efficiency and superior return on equity (RoE).

The brokerage sees a sharp decline in cement prices, demand or a sharp increase in input cost as the key risks.

Insurers hope tax reforms to enhance product affordability in Budget 2024,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/insurers-hope-tax-reforms-to-enhance-product-affordability-in-budget-2024-12775254.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 08:07 AM","Insurance stocks, including HDFC Life, General Insurance, ICICI Lombard, LIC, Star Health, and New India Assurance, surged up to 2 percent on July 22, ahead of the Budget presentation. Companies are hopeful for tax rule adjustments to make their products more affordable and are also seeking amendments to the Insurance Act to support the government’s 'Insurance for All by 2047' initiative. Insurance sector's budget wishlist Currently, the Insurance Act of 1938 allows life insurers to offer only life coverage and restricts general insurers to non-life products such as health, motor, fire, and marine insurance. There is anticipation that the government will accept the Parliamentary Committee's recommendations to allow composite licensing, enabling a single entity to offer both life and non-life products. Life insurance companies are also seeking tax deductions on annuities and lower goods and services tax (GST) on their other products. The new tax regime does not permit exemptions on these products, which were allowed under Section 80C in the old tax regime. Additionally, the industry has requested the government to ease minimum capital requirements. Currently, a minimum capital of Rs 100 crore is required for life, general, and health insurance businesses, and Rs 200 crore for reinsurance businesses. Experts suggest that reducing capital requirements could attract more players, especially those focusing on micro-insurance or agriculture insurance. This would provide more affordable insurance options for customers and create more jobs in the sector. ALSO READ: Nifty's overvaluation signals imminent market correction; HDFC Bank, LTTS stocks among 'key avoids': Emkay Healthy premiums According to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), the gross direct premium of private insurers rose to Rs 1.3 lakh crore in 2022-23, up from Rs 1.09 lakh crore in the previous year. The gross direct premium of public sector insurers increased to Rs 86,324 crore in 2022-23 from Rs 78,335 crore in 2021-22. Additionally, the gross direct premium of health insurers jumped to Rs 26,243 crore in 2022-23 from Rs 20,867 crore a year earlier. Bloomberg data indicates that the insurance sector has been trading at a median price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 28.75 in FY23, up from 22.6x in FY20. This increase has been driven by strong growth in insurance products, healthy premium collections, and wider market penetration. Over the past year, shares of General Insurance, ICICI Lombard, LIC, SBI Life, and New India Assurance have rallied up to 147 percent, compared to a 16 percent rise in the benchmark Nifty 50 index.

Why the Budget is critical for 'overvalued' stock market,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/short-call-can-budget-fire-up-an-overvalued-market-yes-bank-wipro-dalmia-bharat-garden-reach-in-focus-12775372.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 08:20 AM","Market slipped for the second consecutive session ahead of the Budget. The enthusiasm of the bulls has been somewhat tempered by multiple broker reports citing high valuations and a lack of favorable catalysts for further growth. Parts of the latest economic survey also made for a sobering read. ""India Inc's earnings growth, along with strong retail and foreign inflows, has driven the m-cap to GDP ratio to 124 percent at the end of December 2023, with an estimate of 136 percent by the end of June 2024. If equity market valuations significantly exceed the real economy's capacity, it signals market instability rather than resilience,"" the report warned. Emkay Global analysts also adopted a cautious outlook on local equities, forecasting that a weak Q1FY25 earnings season combined with prolonged rate cuts could exacerbate the bearish sentiment. ""Valuations of frontline indices have become frothy, with Nifty trading around 10 percent above the five-year historic mean at 21.4x 1YF PER, while NSE Midcap 150 and NSE Smallcap 250 are 52.5 percent and 35.5 percent above their respective 5-year averages,"" they noted. Despite CLSA's 'India Bull Bear Index' indicating 92 percent bullish sentiment—the highest before any budget in the past 15 years—extreme optimism, coupled with stretched valuations, give bulls little margin of error. The popular 'Modi stocks,' which were to have benefitted the most from NDA’s return to power, have underperformed the market post election results. The question is whether the Budget can inject more optimism into an already overvalued Indian market. Dalmia Bharat (Rs 1,772,-2.5%) Shares slipped after its Q1 lagged analyst estimates. Bull Case: The company's total cement grinding capacity is projected to increase from the current 46.6 mtpa to 49.5 mtpa in FY25E, supporting future volume growth. With current capacity utilisation at 66 percent, there is substantial room for the company to ramp up its production. Bear Case: Lower realisation and demand in its key markets, along with delays in capacity expansion, could affect the company's performance. Additionally, higher input costs may impact its margins. Wipro (Rs 505.35, -9.3%)Q1 FY25 revenue missed estimates. Bull Case: Positive momentum witnessed among US consumers, Capco business, and BFSI. Discretionary demand showing early signs of a recovery. Company secured ten large deals in Q1. Bear Case: EBIT margin surprised positively. Manufacturing, healthcare, and communications verticals declined. Q2 FY25 guidance was weaker than expected. Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (Rs 2,578.10, +5%) Stocks rallied on anticipation of positive announcements for the sector in Union Budget Bull Case: Pipeline includes major naval projects: eight next-gen Corvettes (Rs 36,000 crore), two multi-purpose vessels (Rs 1,200 crore), five NGOPVs (Rs 3,000 crore), two coastal research vessels (Rs 500 crore), 18 next-gen FPVs (Rs 5,000 crore), 21 water-jet FACs (Rs 200 crore), and seven P-17 Bravo frigates (Rs 17,000 crore). Additionally, GRSE expects over Rs 1,600 crore in orders in H1FY25, where it is already the L1 bidder. Bear Case: Execution likely to peak out in FY25. Deferment of a large order in NGC to CY24 from FY24 may defer revenue growth beyond FY26. Given the 187 percent rally in the stock over the last six months compared to Nifty's 15 percent, upside may be limited in lieu of any significant announcement for the sector in Union Budget 2024. Yes Bank (Rs 25.67, +3.6%) Delivered strong Q1 earnings. Bull case: Slippages falling to the lowest in 8 quarters hint at green shoots of recovery even though improvement is likely to be gradual. A sharp decline in provisions in Q1 was another major positive. Bear case: Kotak Institutional Equities sees unfavourable risk-reward amid expectations that underlying RoE improvement is likely to be slow. (With inputs from Vaibhavi, Harshita and Neeshita)

Asia snaps losing streak as chip stocks bounce,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/asia-snaps-losing-streak-as-chip-stocks-bounce-12775374.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 07:36 AM","Asian stocks bounced from one-month lows on Tuesday, with Taiwan's market snapping a five-day losing streak as semiconductor shares took a lead from a Wall Street recovery, while sagging commodity prices weighed on the Aussie dollar. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, which touched a one-month low on Monday, rose 0.55%. Japan's Nikkei steadied thanks to stabilising chip stocks and the share average gained 0.3%. Overnight, the S&P 500 rose 1.1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq went up 1.6% as stocks sold heavily in the last few days rebounded. Markets made little obvious reaction to the end of President Joe Biden's reelection bid. Investors are looking ahead to earnings at Tesla and Alphabet due after the New York close and both stocks advanced sharply on Monday. ""Risk sentiments and Democrat support for Kamala Harris appear to be at least on the way to solid,"" said Mizuho economist Vishnu Varathan in a note to clients. ""What remains to be seen is whether a bull rotation will see gains cascading down ... more broadly into smaller caps."" In Taiwan, the benchmark index was up about 1.7% in early trade and shares in chipmaker TSMC jumped 2%. Over the week to Monday, the company - the most valuable listed firm in Asia - lost about $100 billion in market value after U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump sounded equivocal about protecting Taiwan and its chip industry in a magazine interview. South Korean chipmakers Samsung and SK Hynix also rebounded with traders willing to look through the political risks to extremely strong demand. ""We believe that the dependence on Asian chipmakers is so large that they will not be easily replaced by potential U.S. counterparts for some time,"" said ING economist Min Joo Kang. In bond markets, U.S. yields ticked up overnight and were broadly steady in Asia, with benchmark 10-year yields at 4.25% and two-year yields at 4.51%. Markets have priced two U.S. rate cuts for the second half of this year which has started to weigh on the dollar, even if uncertainty over the U.S. election is keeping it from falling too far. The euro was steady at $1.089 on Tuesday and the yen ticked marginally higher to 156.8 per dollar. China surprised markets with interest rate cuts on Monday and concern over the economic outlook following softer-than-expected growth figures last week have commodities under pressure. Dalian iron ore futures traded at their lowest since April as did Shanghai copper while Brent crude futures made a one-month low overnight and were last at $82.59 a barrel. That has dragged the Australian dollar to three-week lows and the New Zealand dollar to an almost three-month trough of $0.5966, though analysts say a rebound is due. ""While industrial commodity prices have fallen, from a longer-run perspective many of them remain at high levels,"" said Corpay strategist Peter Dragicevich. ""Based on the current level of the copper price the AUD looks to be 'cheap,'"" he said. China's yuan held steady at 7.2732 per dollar.

Nifty’s budget day performance over the past decade: What to expect?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/niftys-budget-day-performance-over-the-past-decade-what-to-expect-12775277.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 07:39 AM","Markets participants are keenly going to watch the presentation of the first Budget of the third consecutive NDA government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi tomorrow by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. Yesterday, Indian benchmark indices ended marginally lower in the volatile session on July 22. Nifty closed at around 24,500 levels trading rangebound throughout the day. While At close, the Sensex was down 79.43 points or 0.10 percent at 80,525.22. An analysis of past data shows that historically, Nifty has moved within a 4 percent range on Budget day. According to Jay Thakkar, Head of Derivative and Quantitative Research at ICICI Securities, “Nifty closes within a range of -2 to +2 percent in 13 out of those 14 budget day sessions, indicating that the 4 percent range is well-defined over the past decade.”Thakkar said that 2021 was an exception when the Nifty closed 4.7 percent (above) its previous close. “Generally, ahead of such events, the options' implied volatilities (IVs) increase, and in the absence of significant changes in the Index, the IVs tend to cool down,” Thakkar added A high IV means traders expect big price swings (either up or down), and low IVs mean traders expect the price to stay relatively stable. Thakkar believes that to benefit from the IV momentum ahead of the event, non-directional strategies should be considered, such as the Short Iron Butterfly or Short Iron Condor. These are four-legged option strategies, involving simultaneously selling and buying of calls and puts. Historical Data Analysis The data below reveals Nifty's performance during the past years Budget sessions and the frequency distribution of the same.   Implied volatility is a measure of how much the price of a stock or other asset is expected to fluctuate in the future. In simpler terms, it reflects the market's expectations of how unpredictable or risky the asset's price is likely to be. Short Iron Butterfly The Short Iron Butterfly strategy involves four options contracts with the same expiration date but three different strike prices. The goal is to profit from minimal movement in the underlying asset's price. This setup includes selling one at-the-money (ATM) call and one ATM put, while simultaneously buying one out-of-the-money (OTM) call and one OTM put. Short Iron Condor The Short Iron Condor strategy also involves four options contracts with the same expiration date but uses four different strike prices. It is similar to the Short Iron Butterfly but with a wider range of strikes, making it a less aggressive strategy. This setup includes selling one lower-strike put and buying one even-lower-strike put, while also selling one higher-strike call and buying one even-higher-strike call.

Renewable EnergyThe upcoming budget is expected to increase investments in renewable energy, focusing on clean technologies and expanding solar and wind power projects. Additional funds are likely to be allocated for R&D in storage solutions, including batteries and pumped storage. Moreover, there may be increased budgetary support for rooftop solar installations and the Suryodaya Yojna, according to Axis Direct. Stocks to watchTata PowerCould benefit from ISTS tax waivers, increased capex announcements, and new scheme announcements. It currently has an installed capacity of around 13 GW.

Increased subsidies for rural housing and food could boost disposable income, driving higher demand for clothing and fabrics. Additionally, support for domestic manufacturing will likely reduce costs and enhance competitiveness, further strengthening Arvind's market position. KPR MillsWith the expected introduction of the ELI scheme, KPR Mills could see substantial benefits in terms of cost reductions and increased incentives for job creation. The government's emphasis on boosting domestic manufacturing and reducing personal income tax could lead to higher consumer spending, thus driving demand for KPR's products. Affordable HousingContinued funding for affordable housing and the development of new satellite townships near metro cities is expected in the upcoming budget. Under the revamped PMAY-G scheme, industry experts expect cash support to increase to Rs 2.3-2.4 lakh per housing unit from Rs 1.2-1.3 lakh in the previous scheme, due to rising construction costs. Industry experts are also seeking a redefinition of affordable housing, and an increase in the defined limit of Rs 45 lakh. Aavas FinanciersThe company provides housing loans mainly in underserved areas across Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, and more. Measures to develop affordable housing in semi-urban and rural areas are expected to benefit the stock.

Aptus Value HousingThe company focuses on affordable housing for self-employed individuals and low- to middle-income families, especially in semi-urban and rural areas. Increased funding and cash support under the revamped PMAY-G scheme and a potential rise in the affordable housing price limit could boost demand and market opportunities for HFCs.

RailwaysThe budget is expected to go big on infrastructure spending, with an increase in allocation for railways as well. The focus will continue safety, travel quality, infrastructure improvement, ensuring faster development and completion of tracks, rolling stock manufacturing and delivery of passenger freight services, said Ramesh Punugu of Acuity. CareEdge Ratings anticipates a budgetary allocation of around Rs 3 lakh crore for the railways in the Union Budget 2024-25, reflecting a 25 percent increase from the previous year. Stocks to watch:IRCTCIncreased budget allocations for railway infrastructure and digitization initiatives will likely boost IRCTC's revenue from e-ticketing and catering services. Enhanced tourism promotion could further elevate their tourism vertical. Container Corporation of IndiaInvestments in logistics infrastructure and policies favoring exports/imports can significantly enhance CONCOR’s operations. Increased focus on trade facilitation and improved supply chains could lead to higher container traffic, boosting revenues from freight services and logistics. Titagarh WagonsGovernment spending on railway expansion and modernization projects will likely increase demand for Titagarh’s railcars and related equipment. Additionally, defense budget enhancements could result in more orders for its specialized vehicles. Texmaco RailHigher government expenditure on railway infrastructure development will positively impact Texmaco Rail. Increased projects for new rail lines, modernization of existing ones, and bridge construction will drive demand for its products and EPC services, potentially boosting its revenue and market share.

Brent crude futures for September fell 9 cents to $82.31 a barrel by 0005 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for September declined 10 cents to $78.30 per barrel. Traders mostly ignored U.S. President Joe Biden's decision to call off his reelection bid and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday. Citi analysts said they believed neither Harris nor Republican nominee Donald Trump would promote policies that would greatly affect oil and gas operations. Instead, the market focused on oil supply and demand, which Morgan Stanley analysts said was likely to balance out by the fourth quarter and rise to a surplus by next year, which would drag down Brent prices to the mid-to-high $70s per barrel range. The American Petroleum Institute, a trade group, is due to release its estimates for last week's oil inventories on Tuesday, while official U.S. government data is scheduled to land on Wednesday. A preliminary Reuters poll of six analysts estimated that U.S. crude stocks, on average, fell by 2.5 million barrels in the week to July 19, while gasoline stocks likely dropped by 500,000 barrels.

Key tips for trading on Budget Day that you should know,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/key-tips-for-trading-on-budget-day-that-you-should-know-12774890.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 06:30 AM","Market participants are gearing up for the presentation of the full Union Budget 2024 on July 23, keenly observing its potential effects on the Indian economy and market dynamics. STT on F&O is expected to be a key announcement to watch out for tomorrow. Ahead of the Budget, SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch remark and Economic Survey have come down heavily on rising futures and options in the stock market by retail investors. ""The newcomers have not experienced all the cycles of the market and have only seen an upward trend since the COVID-19 fall. The recent election result day volatility was an example of how the markets react in case of a fall,"" said Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst, Capital Market Strategy at Sharekhan. Also Read: Union Budget 2024 Live Updates For tomorrow's budget day trading session, Gedia shares key tips for participants who are positioning for the event: Secondary/Backup Trading AccountTraders should always keep a backup trading account in case there is a glitch with their primary account. If a glitch occurs, traders can take a counter position in the secondary account, thereby limiting potential losses in the primary account. Hedged PositionsEvent days bring volatility. Therefore, traders should always have hedged positions to counter intraday volatility. Psychologically, this helps maintain calmness as you are aware of the maximum potential loss beforehand, avoiding panic situations. Proper Execution and Square-offHedge options strategies are one way to trade on an event day. However, it is crucial to ensure that all legs of the strategy are executed properly and squared off in full. If one leg of the options strategy is left open and the market moves against your view, it can result in a loss. Avoid Counter-Trend Positions Traders should take trades that align with the trend. For example, if markets are in an uptrend, long positions are advised. Taking counter-trend positions without confirmation of a trend reversal should be avoided. Instead, take a hedged position; if you have a long position, hedge it by buying a put option, and vice versa.  Index OptionsTrading index options is advisable due to ample liquidity and the ability to diversify risk arising from announcements related to a particular sector. Keep both bullish and bearish strategies handy and execute them as the market trades in line with your outlook. Stock SelectionUnderstand the impact of announcements related to a particular sector before taking a trade. For example, in the interim budget, the fiscal deficit numbers were better than expected. This information positively impacted PSU banks, hence taking long positions on PSU banks was a sound strategy. Capital PreservationThere will be ample trading and investment opportunities, and the fear of missing out should not induce you to risk your entire capital on a particular trade. A stop-loss is essential to take advantage of the next opportunity that comes your way.

Wall Street closes higher as investors return to megacap stocks,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/wall-street-closes-higher-as-investors-return-to-megacap-stocks-12775335.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 06:02 AM","Wall Street's three benchmarks ended higher on Monday as investors returned to megacap growth stocks, helping both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite recover from their worst weekly performance since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also back in positive territory, breaking a two-session skid since hitting an all-time closing high last Wednesday. Megacaps Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Tesla all advanced between 2.2% and 5.1% after being major drags on the market last week. Nvidia also rose 4.8% after Reuters reported the artificial intelligence chip leader was working on a version of its new flagship AI chips for the China market that would be compliant with current U.S. export controls. The Information Technology index climbed 2%, topping sectoral gainers and snapping a four-day losing streak. ""We think this move today probably has more to do with a rebound from the selling that occurred last week than anything else,"" said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy & research at Glenmede. Chief among the other factors on traders' minds was a reexamination of the state of the presidential race after U.S. President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris' candidacy for the November election on Sunday. Biden's exit could prompt investors to unwind trades on bets that a victory for Republican Trump would increase U.S. fiscal and inflationary pressures. But some analysts said markets could benefit from an increased chance of a divided government under the next administration. Online betting site PredictIt showed pricing for a Donald Trump victory slipped 4 cents to 60 cents, while climbing 12 cents for a Harris win to 39 cents. Trump-linked stocks were mixed on Monday, with Trump Media & Technology Group dropping 0.8%, while software firm Phunware gained 4%. Having digested the news of Biden's withdrawal, investors will now be looking for answers to key questions including who will join Harris on the Democratic presidential ticket and to what degree, if any, the vice president will deviate from the platform which Biden was headlining. This element of uncertainty is present alongside traders' angst over quarterly earnings, including from two of the so-called Magnificent Seven companies - Alphabet and Tesla - on deck this week. The results will test whether the recent rally in top-tier high-momentum stocks is tenable and if a move to underperforming sectors will continue. ""We're seeing the market begin to price in a little bit a faster set of rate cuts, and that is leading to a bit of a shift in leadership to favor smaller-cap stocks and to deviate from the focus on the largest tech companies,"" said Glenmede's Pride. ""Obviously today looks a little bit different to that, but it's still a trend in the background."" The S&P 500 gained 59.41 points, or 1.08%, at 5,564.41 points, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 280.63 points, or 1.58%, to 18,007.57. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 127.91 points, or 0.32%, to 40,415.44. Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike slumped 13.5%, extending losses after a software update from the company sparked Friday's global tech outage. Delta Air Lines dropped 3.5% after canceling over 600 flights as it struggled to restore operations after the outage. Verizon Communications fell 6.1% after a second-quarter revenue miss. Mattel Inc jumped 15.1% after Reuters reported the toy maker had been approached by buyout firm L Catterton with an acquisition offer.

"Tobacco, gaming industries brace for Budget day announcements",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/tobacco-gaming-industries-brace-for-budget-day-announcements-12775217.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 06:01 AM","Finance Ministers often have the reputation of giving with one hand while taking with the other. The upcoming Budget brings hopes of revised tax brackets and benefits for the middle class. However, there is a concern that the government may demand something in return, such as increased taxes on cigarettes and no relief for the gaming industry. While the main focus will likely be on infrastructure, manufacturing, and consumption-related announcements, some experts are keenly observing what Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s first post-election Budget might offer for the liquor, tobacco, and gaming sectors. Rumors suggest that excise duty or NCCD duty on cigarettes and other tobacco products might see an increase. For the alcohol industry, a more uniform tax structure across states, combined with investments in initiatives for responsible consumption, could unlock the sector’s full potential, according to Tushar Bhandari of Associated Alcohols and Breweries. He also noted that targeted support, such as streamlined licensing processes or other pro-innovation measures, would greatly encourage entrepreneurship and creativity in this sector. Last month, gaming company shares surged on speculation that the GST Council might adopt a lenient stance on taxing their income. The online gaming industry has been lobbying for a 28 percent GST on gross gaming revenue (GGR) rather than on the total amount deposited by players. Roland Landers of the All India Gaming Federation stated that clear GST regulations would foster growth, create a favorable business environment, and restore investor confidence in the sector, making gaming a key component of Digital India. However, the Council's recent meeting ended without providing the anticipated relief, disappointing the industry. Key tobacco companies such as ITC, Godfrey Phillip, and VST Industries will be closely watched on Budget day for any announcements on excise duty. Domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal, however, believes that fears of an excise duty hike may be unwarranted. Motilal Oswal commented that stable macroeconomic conditions and government initiatives, such as maintaining steady taxes and controlling illegal cigarettes, are expected to support ITC’s volume growth. In the gaming sector, Nazara Tech and Delta Corp will be significant movers if there are any changes in the taxation structure.

Consumer durables industry awaits Budget measures to boost demand,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/12775216-12775216.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 05:31 AM","Consumer durable firms are looking forward to the upcoming Budget with hopes that it will include measures to reduce imports, extend Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, and implement policies to boost domestic manufacturing. Firms like Cera Sanityware, Amber Enterprises and Crompton Greaves were the top consumer durable winners on the Nifty Consumer Durables index. Analysts predict that a key focus of the Budget will be enhancing rural income, which would indirectly stimulate demand for consumer durables. The industry believes that varying tax rates and an expanded PLI scheme could enhance local manufacturing, attract investments, drive innovation, and create jobs. Additionally, offering incentives based on total revenue and reducing corporate taxes would foster business growth. Currently, there is a PLI scheme for white goods, with the government investing Rs 6,962 crore in 66 beneficiaries under the PLIWG. There is potential for a new scheme to include more consumer durables beyond ACs and LED lights. This expansion could lead to new jobs, manufacturing units, and increased logistics, according to Balasubramanian A from TeamLease Services. Balasubramanian also mentioned that infrastructure development, a focus on rural areas, and social sector spending could significantly boost the penetration of consumer durables in rural markets. This could potentially double the market size within five years and create substantial job opportunities in rural retail and service sectors such as installation and repair. Simplified compliance, emphasis on research and development (R&D), and efficient supply chain management are essential for the consumer durables sector's success. Elara Securities suggests that reducing import duties on components like compressors and semiconductors would lower production costs, making final products more affordable for consumers and boosting demand. Companies like Polycab India, Dixon Technologies, and Amber Enterprises could benefit significantly from government incentives aimed at manufacturing and electronics production, as noted by Bonanza Portfolio.

Industry leaders and analysts are optimistic that the recent election outcome, which was a setback for the NDA, could lead to a stronger focus on the rural sector in the upcoming Budget. Over the past five sessions, the Nifty FMCG index has gained around two percent, showcasing the market's optimism. The market anticipates that increased funding for social sector programs and new welfare schemes could enhance rural consumption, potentially transforming the prospects for FMCG companies. Measures such as improving rural infrastructure, enhancing rural connectivity, and boosting capital expenditure are expected to stimulate rural consumption. Also Read: UNION BUDGET 2024 Live Updates Tanvee Gupta Jain, Chief India Economist at UBS, expressed optimism about a cyclical recovery in rural consumption in FY25E. This recovery is anticipated to be driven by higher allocations for social sector schemes in the upcoming union budget, promises from recent state budgets and elections, sustained double-digit growth in public capital expenditure (to support rural employment), normal monsoons, and the likely removal of export bans on agricultural commodities. Over the past year, many states have increased their budgets for welfare programs. These enhancements include greater cash transfers to farmers, bonuses above the Minimum Support Price (MSP), and farm loan waivers, alongside increased capital expenditure. Incentives to boost domestic production of edible oil, pulses, vegetables, and fruits, as well as the expansion of dairy cooperatives and fisheries, would help reduce food inflation. This reduction would also lower raw material costs for many consumer staples, allowing companies to lower prices without hurting margins, thereby increasing demand. The primary beneficiaries of this anticipated rise in rural demand are likely to be major large-cap consumer staples companies such as Dabur India, Hindustan Unilever, Nestle India, and Godrej Consumer Products. Beverage and discretionary categories, along with companies expanding their geographic reach, are expected to outperform other FMCG peers. ""We foresee Nestle, Jyothy Labs, and VBL leading the overall revenue growth for the sector,"" stated Axis Securities.

Will hike in capital-gains tax in Budget 2024 spook markets?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/will-hike-in-capital-gains-tax-in-budget-2024-spook-markets-12774608.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 05:03 AM","The markets could react badly if there is any increase in capital gains tax, according to market insiders. There has been worries that the Union Budget may deliver a nasty surprise by raising the tax, and veterans believe that if this does happen, the current buoyancy would be dampened. In conversations with Moneycontrol, market insiders said that any such hike may not even serve the purpose of increasing government revenues. Instead, it might end up simply hurting investors and companies looking to raise money. Dhirendra Kumar, CEO of Value Research said that it will definitely put the markets in a ""bad mood"" for a while. Kumar had written in 2022 about how the Indian equity investor is a ""little too obsessed"" with capital gains tax. Also read: Brokerages hope that FM does not increase STT and LTCG in budget Capital gains tax was introduced in Budget 2018. Currently, equity holdings (either as shares or units of equity oriented mutual funds) sold before one year attracts a short-term capital gains tax (SCGT) of 15 percent while those sold after one year attracts a long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) of 10 percent on gains over Rs 1 lakh in one year. Suresh Swamy, partner at PwC India, said that if the market reaction to the 2018 taxation could be taken as an indication, ""investors would have to brace themselves for a tough ride"". Some experts such as Rajesh Gandhi, partner at Deloitte India, opined  that the impact of any hike may be felt more by high net-worth individuals (HNIs). Gandhi said, ""Any hike in capital gains tax could create at least a temporary adverse impact both on market sentiment and tax leakage for investors considering that the markets have performed very well."" He added, ""While the impact would be all across, it could be felt more by HNIs and other investors who trade significantly."" UNION BUDGET 2024 Live Updates There could be an unintended consequences from such a hike, according to Gouri Puri, partner at Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas. It may simply dissuade people from realising their gains and end up not serving the purpose of generating income for the government. She said, ""A hike in capital gains tax could adversely impact the sentiment around savings and investment. People may be less inclined to realise gains, which in turn could offset the expected revenue gains from higher tax rates. This could impact both retail investors and Indian ventures that are looking for capital."" To boost sentiment Will any announcement around capital gains tax help the market? Veterans said that rationalisation of the tax structure to simplify it would definitely boost sentiment. Harsh Roongta, a registered Investment Advisor and founder of Fee Only Investment Advisors, said that he does not know what change around capital gains tax will be announced but added that if any change was being planned, it should be to overhaul the structure to make it simpler.

Roongta said that he has no idea if there will be any change in the capital gains tax structure but said that simplifying the structure was something that has to be done, because all the tinkering with the structure has created a ""smorgasbord that nobody can remember"". Roongta's opinion is shared by other veterans though expressed less vociferously. Deloitte's Gandhi said, ""There is a general expectation that capital gains tax rules should be simplified across different asset classes. This could be initiated in Budget 2024 with certain tweaks to the rules. Also, there is an expectation that taxation of derivatives should be moderated. There is also an expectation to provide clarity in taxation of Cat 3 (category 3 or more complex) AIFs (alternative investment funds)  especially long-only funds."" Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas' Puri said that rationalisation of the capital gains tax regime has been a longstanding demand from the industry, which believes that the distortionary impact of having different rates across asset classes and investors adversely affects the development of Indian capital markets and promotes inequity.

"Market insiders expect STT hike in Budget 2024, expect HFTs to be hit hard",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/market-insiders-expect-stt-hike-in-budget-2024-expect-hfts-to-be-hit-hard-12775143.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 03:31 AM","Market players are expecting the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to announce a hike in securities transaction tax (STT) for the futures and options (F&O) segment in the coming Union Budget. They see a strong possibility because of the concerns raised by the capital markets regulator recently and even by the Economic Survey 2023-24 issued on July 22. At a recent press conference, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEB) chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch said that turnover in index options in premium terms had gone up from Rs 4.5 lakh crore in 2018 to Rs 140 lakh crore in 2024. The overall turnover in the derivatives segment had risen from Rs 210 lakh crore in 2018 to Rs 500 lakh crore in 2024. And the share of individual investors was up from 2 percent to 41 percent in the same period. Also read: Speculative trading has no place in a developing country like India: Economic Survey The Economic Survey event went so far as to say that the speculative nature of derivatives trading has ""no place in a developing country"" like India. The survey report pointed out that capital markets must play their theoretically assigned role of directing savings to productive investments. This, the survey stated, is not just in the national interest but is also an act of self interest. ALSO READ: Union Budget 2024 Live Updates Currently, STT on the sale of options is 0.0625 percent, which is paid by the seller; on the sale of options in which the option is exercised, it is 0.125 percent, which is payable by the buyer; and on sale of futures it is 0.0125 percent, which is payable by the seller. While most market participants refused to speculate on the extent of the STT hike, a couple ventured that it could be even up to 10 percent increase from now. There have been industry representations made in late June to the Finance Minister to raise STT on derivative trades undertaken by high-frequency traders, said Suresh Swamy, partner at Price Waterhouse & Co LLP ""So far, the government has not formally indicated any intentions to increase STT in the budget. One would need to wait for the budget to be announced to see if there are any hikes to the STT rates,” he added. Ayush Agrawal, a SEBI-registered research analyst, said that while nothing is certain, ""there are chances of an increase because the regulator wants to discourage derivative trading"". A seasoned trader with decades of experience, Rajesh Srivastava too believes that any taxation intervention to prevent speculative trading will most likely in the derivatives segment. The government could also be driven by the need to shore up revenues, said Srivastava, especially since the recent tax collections have been impressive. Data released recently by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) showed that the collection via STT between April 1 and July 11 had shot up by 128 percent year-on-year. The government collected Rs 16,634 crore during this period in FY25 versus Rs 7,285 crore in FY24. Nitin Mangal, founder of Trudence Capital, too said that a rise in the tax is likely because of the government’s inclination to raise revenues through taxation. “For this they need to either widen the GST (goods and services tax) net or increase the STT. Therefore, I think there is a high likelihood that both will happen and that they will raise the STT by another 10 percent. High-frequency traders beware If you are a high-frequency trader or an algo trader or an intraday trader, then there is reason to worry. Agrawal said that any increase ""would target the high-volume trading activities that dominate the Indian derivatives market"". Srivastava said, ""Intraday traders would be significantly impacted due to increased transaction costs which will lead to lower profitability."" He added that algo traders, who rely on high-frequency adjustments, too would be badly hit. He said, ""They would be forced to shift to strategies with fewer adjustments. Consequently, this is also likely to slow down the adoption of automation in trading."" PwC’s Swamy pointed out that since the previous hike in STT in the derivatives segment was “very recent”, another hike so soon may impact active traders. He said, “STT rates on cash equities have been stable for quite some time now. The last amendment was in 2012, when the STT rate on delivery-based equities was reduced from 0.125 percent to 0.1 percent on sale and purchase of equity shares. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that the hike in STT rates on the derivatives segment was as recent as the Finance Bill, 2023, where a 25 percent hike was implemented on sale of options (from 0.05 percent to 0.0625 percent) and sale of futures (from 0.01 percent to 0.0125 percent).” Market veterans also pointed out how it will affect liquidity in the market. Harsh Roongta, a SEBI-registered investment advisor and founder of Fee Only Investment Advisors, said ""taxation is a blunt instrument"". ""It will affect everyone,"" he said. Roongta is of the opinion that the market regulator has more nuanced instruments to control speculative trading in the form of interventions like it is considering now through its expert committee recommendations. Both Roongta and Srivastava feel that increased costs will lead to a drying up of liquidity in the derivatives segment.

Brokerages hope that FM does not increase STT and LTCG in budget,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/brokerages-hope-that-fm-does-not-increase-stt-and-ltcg-in-budget-12774611.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 03:01 AM","As the Union budget approaches, brokerage firms are growing concerned that any increase in the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) or long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax could negatively impact trading volumes, affecting their business operations. Market insiders told Moneycontrol that if STT is increased it will lower the volumes because traders would not trade as frequently as they do now as the overall trading costs would go up. Incidentally, the trading costs are already expected to rise following the uniform exchange fee regime that will come into effect from October 1. STT is a tax charged on the purchase and sale of securities that are listed on the stock exchanges in India. “If STT is increased it will mostly be for the F&O segment and not the cash segment,” said a person wishing not to be named. He further added that an increase in STT would reduce market liquidity, as intraday traders significantly contribute to market liquidity. Shravan Shetty of Primus Partners, however, believes that a 20-30 percent increase in STT will not significantly affect traders, as the tax in absolute terms would still be relatively low. He added that unless the increase is substantial, trading volumes are unlikely to be significantly impacted. He, however, added that if short term capital gain tax is increased with STT, it will have a greater impact on trading volumes. Currently, STT on the sale of options is 0.0625 percent, which is paid by the seller. On the sale of options in which the option is exercised, it is 0.125 percent, which is payable by the buyer. And on sale of futures, it is 0.0125 percent, which is payable by the seller. STT is a major contributor to direct tax collections of the government, and increase in STT rates would likely provide a further boost to such revenues, said Surajkumar Shetty, Partner at JSA Advocates and Solicitors. Currently, the market isn’t anticipating negative surprises in areas like income tax, LTCG, STCG, or STT. However, any changes could have a short-term negative impact, said  Krishna Appala, Sr. Research Analyst, Capitalmind Research. Triggers ahead Demat accounts in India still have relatively low penetration compared to major global markets, presenting significant growth opportunities for brokerage firms, according to Ravi Singh, Senior Vice President of Retail Research at Religare Broking. Financial education is expanding beyond major metropolitan areas, enabling the industry to access previously untapped markets and drive growth, remarked Akshat Garg, Assistant Vice President of Research at Choice Wealth. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has also been proactive with its regulations, the latest being the implementation of a uniform fee for all broking firms. ""The uniform transaction fee could hinder price discovery and trading volumes, potentially being counterproductive,"" commented Nilesh Sharma, Executive Director and President of Samco Securities. On July 1, Sebi issued a directive stating that market infrastructure institutions (MIIs)—including stock exchanges, depositories, and clearing corporations—should charge a uniform fee from their members without offering any volume-based rebates. Exchanges levy a transaction fee on trades conducted on their platforms, charging brokers on a monthly basis. The NSE applies these transaction fees on a slab basis for the month. However, brokers charge their clients daily using the highest slab rate. The difference between the collected fees and the actual fees paid to the NSE is recorded as net profit in the brokers' financial statements. Analysts note that the regulators' increased focus on reducing derivative trading volumes presents another challenge. Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch has frequently pointed out that around 90 percent of traders incur losses in futures and options (F&O). Stocks that could be impacted by potential hikes in Securities Transaction Tax (STT) or Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax include Motilal Oswal Financial Services, 5paisa, ICICI Securities, Angel One, IIFL Securities, and Geojit Financial Services, among others. How is the sector looking?The recent quarters have seen broking firms registering a significant jump in the number of client additions and demat accounts. The total number of demat accounts increased to 16.2 crore in June 2024, as per a report by Motilal Oswal. New additions in June were pegged at 42 lakh -- the highest monthly gain since February 2024. Meanwhile, NSE reported a 3.1 percent month-on-month increase in active clients to 4.42 crore in June 2024.

Banking sector awaits privatisation and capex boost in Budget 2024,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/banking-sector-awaits-privatisation-and-capex-boost-in-budget-2024-12775247.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 02:45 AM","Banking stocks, including SBI, Bank of Baroda, IDBI Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and Axis Bank, showed mixed performance on July 22, the day before the Budget presentation. These stocks have been active since the election results on June 4, driven by expectations of public sector bank privatisations and measures to boost private capex. What is the banking industry seeking from this Budget? The 2021 Budget announced the privatisation of some public sector banks (PSBs) as part of a disinvestment initiative aiming to raise Rs 1.75 trillion. This plan included IDBI Bank, two PSBs, and one general insurance company. The disinvestment process for IDBI Bank is still ongoing, and market participants are eager for updates on further equity dilution in PSBs. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities argue that given the buoyant markets and demand for PSU companies in secondary markets, the government should pursue aggressive stake sales, including outright strategic sales or privatizations. Increased allocations towards infrastructure projects such as roads, power, urban development, and railways could also boost credit offtake and improve the overall health of the banking sector, according to analysts. ALSO READ: A look at how markets have moved before and after Budget Since the election results, shares of SBI, Bank of Baroda, IDBI Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and Axis Bank have surged up to 15 percent, compared to a 6.7 percent rise in the Bank Nifty index. Indian banks in excellent health Currently, Indian banks are in excellent condition. Gross bad loans (NPAs) have dropped to a 12-year low of 2.8 percent in FY24, and net NPAs are at a historic low of 0.6 percent. Balance sheets are the strongest they have been in over a decade, and profits have rebounded sharply, quadrupling in 10 years. The return on equity (ROE) of the Indian banking sector is the highest at 15 percent since FY2011. Loan growth in the sector has increased from a decadal average of 10 percent to 15 percent over the past two years. In the past year, shares of Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, SBI, Bank of Baroda, IDBI Bank, and Federal Bank have surged up to 58 percent, compared to a 16 percent rise in the benchmark Nifty 50 index. If the 2024 Budget implements banking reforms, it could increase lending, mobilize deposits, and drive credit offtake, benefiting the banking sector and related stocks. The privatisation of select lenders would also aid fiscal consolidation and attract investors in the equity markets.

AMCs ask for equal treatment of MFs and ULIPs in budget,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/amcs-ask-for-equal-treatment-of-mfs-and-ulips-in-budget-12774735.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 02:31 AM","Asset Management Companies are optimistic that the Finance Minister will address the existing tax disparities between equity mutual funds and Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs). Additionally, the mutual fund industry is advocating for equitable treatment between foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and foreign investors investing in Indian Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs). Stocks likely to be impacted by any sector announcements include HDFC AMC, UTI AMC, Nippon Life India Asset Management, and Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC. Christy Mathai, fund manager at Quantum Mutual Fund said that the tax rates for both ULIPs and equity mutual funds should be the same because ULIPs are essentially investment products providing some risk cover.Currently, the returns are not taxed for ULIPs, if the annual premium is less than Rs 2.5 lakh. The government should also revise the definition of equity-oriented mutual fund schemes to include equity Fund of Fund (FoF) schemes, said Mathai. He said that Equity FoFs should be treated on par with equity-oriented mutual funds for taxation purposes. Currently, equity FoFs are classified as debt-oriented for tax purposes. Vinod Joseph of Economic Laws Practice said that there should be tax parity for investments made by foreign investors through the FPI route, and the investments made through Indian Alternate Investment Funds(AIFs). FPIs benefit from Double Tax Avoidance Agreements (DTAs) because they are often based in tax-friendly jurisdictions like Mauritius and Singapore. Joseph said that when an Indian AIF tries to raise money from overseas investors their biggest competitor is an FPI. So, if overseas investors want to invest in Indian equities, they can do it as an FPI or via an AIF. But they go for the former route because of tax benefits due to DTA. He also suggested that the pass-through status should be extended to category 3 AIFs, ensuring that business income is taxed only in the hands of the investors, not the fund. How is the sector looking?Over the past year, asset management companies (AMCs) have enjoyed margin expansion thanks to a more favorable equity mix, spurred by growth in the equity markets. Investors have consistently preferred equity mutual funds over debt and other categories, leading to steady inflows. In June, Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) crossed the Rs 21,000 crore mark, and new fund offers (NFOs) also drew substantial inflows. According to the latest AMFI data for June 2024, active NFO equity inflows jumped 54.1 percent month-on-month to Rs 151.4 billion. However, analysts caution that valuations in the AMC sector seem pricey. AMCs are trading at a 40-50 percent premium to broader markets, according to a report by Kotak Institutional Equities. The report highlighted that while AMCs have strong cash flows and growth potential, their profits can be vulnerable to market downturns. Despite stronger markets supporting AUM growth for all AMCs, this is not always reflected in earnings multiples. Mathai noted that at some point, inflows will slow, and the current valuations might not be justified, leading to a potential de-rating. Jignesh Shial of Incred Capital pointed out that while HDFC AMC appears overvalued, other companies in the sector still show potential for growth.

Government push for self-sufficiency and rising demand keeps market upbeat on Semiconductors,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/government-push-for-self-sufficiency-and-rising-demand-keeps-market-upbeat-on-semiconductors-12774653.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 02:01 AM","The Indian semiconductor market is set to achieve a valuation of $55 billion by 2026, global consultancy firm Deloitte had noted in 2023. With the Union government keen on self-reliance in semiconductor manufacturing, the market is hopeful the upcoming Budget will have some far-reaching announcements for the sector in order to reach these goals. Currently, listed companies like HCL Technologies, Tata Elxsi, Moschip Technologies, ASM Technologies, SPEL Semiconductor, RIR Power Electronics, and CG Power have some amount of exposure in the domestic semiconductor space. As per studies, the sector is estimated to grow at 19 percent CAGR. Budget expectations In the Interim Budget, the sector had been allocated around Rs  7,000 crore, which experts say may se some changes in the upcoming budget, but it may not make a major impact. ""This (interim budget) figure is significant as it is indicative of the possible allocation in the upcoming budget,” he said, but added that “it may not be a game-changer for the larger players,” says Sagar Lele, founder at Rupeeting. Most budget allocations, he says, aim to subsidize capital for new players and may not impact larger players as such, ""These funds might benefit smaller, non-listed players focusing on manufacturing, but not on design, leading to a partial sector play,"" he added. Eswara Rao Nandam, CEO and Founder, Polymatech Electronics said that a multipronged approach was necessary to ensure global competitiveness. Polymatech Electronics designs chips for different purposes such as mobiles, TVs and wearables. “Strategic investments in infrastructure development are paramount, with a particular focus on uninterrupted electricity supply, readily available water resources, efficient transportation networks, and a skilled workforce,"" he said. Semiconductor mission In the July 22 Economic Survey, it was highlighted that the Indian government has been placing a high priority on electronics hardware manufacturing as a part of both ""Make in India"" and ""Digital India"" initiatives. This includes schemes like the India Semiconductor Mission. “These schemes have been instrumental in driving growth in the country's electronics sector. As a result, the CAGR in the production of electronics goods from FY18 to FY23 was 16.19 percent, while the exports increased by 35.7 percent in the same period,” the survey noted. In December 2021, the government launched the India Semiconductor Mission, announcing an Rs 76,000-crore chip incentive scheme, offering a 50 percent subsidy on capital expenditure for plant setup. In the interim budget, an additional Rs 6,903 crore was announced. Following this, in March 2024, three major projects received approval under the scheme: CG Power's proposed Rs 7,600-crore chip packaging facility in Gujarat's Sanand in partnership with Japan's Renesas Electronics; Tata Group's Rs 27,000-crore chip assembly plant in Morigaon, Assam; and Tata Electronics' Rs 91,000-crore plant in collaboration with Taiwan-based Powerchip in Dholera, Gujarat. Additionally, a Rs 275-crore packaging plant by US-based Micron Technology is under construction in Gujarat. In March this year, IT Minister Ashwin Vaishnav had told Moneycontrol that the focus of the government will now be more on the semiconductor design ecosystem in the second version of the semiconductor (programme). ""The second version of semicon will basically focus on getting at least 10 chipsets which are full solutions and taking those solutions down the value chain of fab and ATMP,"" he said, adding that there will be a large focus on getting all the other 16,000 gases and chemicals needed in a fab. ""Many of the companies have started setting up their plants now already but we have to how we scale up that to a larger level,"" he added. Early days, say analysts While the semiconductor industry presents significant growth opportunities, it is currently in a very nascent stage in India. Vikas Gupta, smallcase Manager and CEO, Chief Investment Strategist, OmniScience Capital from Omniscience notes, ""The global move towards a more redundant supply chain away from China is attracting international semiconductor companies to consider India as a possible base. The PLI schemes and the global supply chain restructuring provide solid grounds for growth for the semiconductor sector in India."" The headwinds for the sector, Gupta adds, are currently land acquisitions, access to power and water, roads and railways connectivity, raw material, import of advanced machinery, and approvals not coming in fast enough. ""These pose significant challenges to manufacturers."" Krishna Appala, Senior Research Analyst, Capitalmind Research emphasizes the impact of the existing Rs 76,000-crore incentive, stating, ""It would be beneficial to increase this because it has encouraged companies like CG Power, Tata, and Micron to set up facilities with capacities ranging from 5,000 to 7,000 kilowatts. If more incentives are provided or if this incentive continues, it would greatly benefit the semiconductor industry."" Valuations Most analysts believe that the valuations for the sector are stretched, adding that currently most of the sector pure plays are unlisted. Currently larger listed players include Tata Elxsi, BHEL, CG Power and Tata Tech. Appala adds, ""While valuations are high and may experience fluctuations, especially in the short term, they reflect expectations for growth over the next five years."" Lele notes that ultimately, ""The sector's growth will depend heavily on execution. While there may be plans and announcements, tangible results in terms of production and revenue are still distant. The real value lies in not just manufacturing but also in design, testing, and an integrated approach. Without this full-chain integration, immediate investment in the sector may not be lucrative."" Lele advises caution regarding market reactions to announcements, ""Announcements related to semiconductors might lead to positive stock reactions, but these are likely temporary. Major companies, like Tata collaborating with a Taiwanese firm, will take at least 150-300 days to set up capacity and start production. Smaller players will take even longer. Given this gestation period and the minimal immediate impact on revenue, market reactions to such news should be viewed cautiously.""

"Capital goods sector optimistic on increase in infrastructure spends, continued capex",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/capital-goods-sector-optimistic-on-increase-in-infrastructure-spends-continued-capex-12774887.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 01:31 AM","All eyes will be on Government announcements on increased capital expenditure and infrastructure development in the July 23 Union Budget. This will be important for the capital goods sector, which has seen a slow start to the new fiscal on account of elections. Budget expectations Industry analysts are expecting the government to continue with its capex plan for FY25 with a heightened focus on Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme amongst others etc. Manoj Rawat, Research Analyst at Anand Rathi Institutional Equities, says that they expect the government to continue with its capex plan of Rs 11.1 trillion for FY25. “Although the ordering has been weak so far due to elections, the execution is expected to be strong given the robust outstanding order book. For instance, ABB, Siemens, and L&T currently have order books of Rs 8,400 crores, Rs 47,000 crores, and Rs 475,800 crores respectively, giving them revenue visibility of 1 to 2 years,” says Rawat. Rawat also expects the government to focus on areas like the PLI scheme, renewable energy, power, and water infrastructure, which could benefit companies like ABB, Siemens, Cummins, BHEL, and Hitachi Energy. Similarly, Amit Anwani of Prabhudas Lilladher, believes that the government will not announce major changes in capex spending from what was announced in the interim budget. “However, there might be slight adjustments, particularly in the railway sector, with a focus on safety and modernisation,” he says. Market participants also expect the budget to indirectly benefit various sub-segments within the capital goods universe through allocations to infrastructure areas such as roads, railways, and defence while expecting announcements related to railway safety, new railway lines, and further investments in semiconductor manufacturing. Parikshit Khandpal, VP of Institutional Securities, HDFC Securities, notes that capital goods have a diverse number of segments, including consumables driven by infrastructure spending, power value chain components, process industries like oil & gas, and railway supplies. Similarly, Arafat Saiyed, Vice President of InCred Capital, highlights a structural shift in capex and includes stocks like L&T, KEC, Kalpataru Projects, and Skipper as his top picks on the back of expectations of investment picking up in power transmission and distribution. “The earlier trend was towards traditional sectors like textiles, power, metals, and cement. This is now shifting towards renewable energy, power transmission and distribution, data centers, new edge technology, and semiconductor manufacturing. The ongoing export recovery and government thrust via the PLI scheme are critical enablers,” says Saiyed. High Valuations remain a concern The segment, most analysts agree, has high valuations with major companies trading at more than 80 times their one-year forward earnings. ""Valuations in the capital goods segment are currently at an average of 50-60 percent premium compared to long-term averages. This is due to strong export and domestic markets in power, renewables, and transmission,"" Khandpal noted. Anwani adds that while valuations have been quite high, particularly compared to averages of the past five to ten years, with increases of 50 to 80 percent in some cases, the macro themes within railways, industrial equipment, and power equipment remain strong. “For example, in power equipment, there is significant transmission capex of 1.5 lakh crore expected in the next 18 months for transmission evacuations of solar power from Khavda and other renewable parks. This includes high demand for complex products like HVDC, which are essential for carrying high power over long distances. Many companies are increasing their capacity by 25-30 percent, anticipating 12-13 percent volume growth over the next 2-3 years,” explains Anwani. Further, for the railway sector, Anwani notes that there have been increased valuations but also significant demand. Major orders have already been placed in the recent past, such as a Rs 26,000-crore locomotive order to Siemens. He expects continued growth in rolling stock orders, including electric locomotives and metro coaches with companies like Titagarh Wagons, Jupiter, BEML, Siemens, and others benefiting.

"Street eyes higher allocation for renewables, incentives as power demand rise",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/street-eyes-higher-allocation-for-renewables-incentives-as-power-demand-rise-12774904.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 01:01 AM","As power demand continues to rise, the power sector has its eyes set on announcements for renewables in the upcoming Budget. Analysts at Axis Securities, in their pre-budget note, highlighted that in order to achieve the target of 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, as set by the government, a significant boost is required for the renewable sector. The sector and analysts are hoping to see announcements regarding  support for the hydropower sector through the establishment of a nodal agency dedicated to hydropower development and incentives for pumped storage hydropower plants. They also expect the Finance Ministry to extend the eligibility for the ISTS waiver for renewable projects beyond June 2025. Analysts at Axis believe measures such as enhanced viability gap funding for battery storage, offshore wind plants, and solar energy, and increased public-private partnerships and sustainable financing for renewable projects could do the trick for the sector. On the taxation front, the industry is also hoping for a reduction in GST on renewable energy components like solar devices, and the removal or reduction of customs duties on imported renewable components like solar modules and storage batteries. To boost transition to sustainable energy, budgetary allocations are also expected for rooftop solar installations and alternative energy sources like compressed biogas (CBG), ethanol, and green hydrogen, stated a note by Axis Securities. Incidentally, the National Green Hydrogen Mission, which saw its allocation increased to Rs 600 crore in the interim Budget, is expected to receive further boosts to promote green hydrogen energy in India. Further, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) is likely to receive a substantial boost, following the interim Budget announcement of a 65 percent jump in allocation to Rs 12,491 crore. Power demand on the rise India’s power demand has grown 7.3 percent YoY in FY24 while registering a five percent CAGR over last five years. “From 2014 to 2021, power demand relative to GDP growth was around 0.8%, but it has now increased to 1.1-1.2 percent,” says Rupesh Sankhe, Vice President at Elara Capital. This increase, he notes, is driven by higher per capita consumption and initiatives like Make in India and PLI schemes. With peak demand projected to reach 370 GW by 2030, significant investment in thermal capacity and R&D for offshore wind, battery storage, and hydrogen data centres is expected, which, in turn, presents a Rs 42 lakh crore opportunity for relevant companies, he adds. In a recent report, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities noted that while the pace of capacity addition has picked up, we are still walking a tight rope. Key stocks to watch Power stocks have been rallying over the last one year with valuations in the power sector currently higher compared to historical averages. “EBITDA multiples have risen from 12-13x to 15-16x, and price-to-value multiples from 2.5-3x to 3.5-4x,” says Sankhe. Despite expensive valuations (60 to 100x), Amit Anwani, Research Analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher expects there to be good growth for the next two to three years. Power is seeing significant growth and the government plans to add 50-55 gigawatts of thermal power over the next six to seven years, says Anwani,  while adding that this has increased hopes for conventional thermal players, including BHEL, which have received orders worth Rs 1 lakh crore in the past 15 months. Transmission line companies and power equipment companies are also expected to benefit from the need for evacuation systems. “The power sector is seeing a triple boost from thermal, wind, and renewable energy. Offshore wind power projects and increased wind installations are benefiting companies like Suzlon, with expected improvements in FY24,” he adds. In solar, according to Anwani, the major benefit lies in evacuation systems rather than installation. “Installation is happening at 80-90% capacity, but the main gains are from the evacuation systems. Companies like Apar Industries, ABB, Siemens (which supply power equipment), and switchgears and circuit breakers are seeing growth,” he says. While near-term earnings growth is already priced in, there is potential for decent returns over the long term up to 2030, say analysts. However, short-term price appreciation may not match the growth seen in the last two years, they add. Stocks to watch include PFC, REC, and IREDA, which could benefit from increased allocations and private investments. Transmission companies and equipment manufacturers like smart metering and substation providers, such as Genus Power, Techno Electric, and ABB Signals, are also poised to gain. PSUs like NTPC and NHPC will also be in focus, going ahead.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Mphasis, HUL, Latent View, PI Industries, and others on budget day?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-mphasis-hul-latent-view-pi-industries-and-others-on-budget-day-12775276.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 12:43 AM","The market recovered nearly 150 points from the day's low and defended 24,500 for another session on July 22, with the Nifty 50 declining just 22 points to 24,509 ahead of the Union Budget on July 23. About 1,345 shares advanced, while 1,038 shares declined on the NSE. Experts see less chance of a major correction, with the Nifty likely to take support in the 24,200-24,000 zone, whereas 24,800-25,000 may act as a resistance area. Here are some trading ideas for the near term: Pravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst at Swastika Investmart PI Industries | CMP: Rs 4,008  PI Industries has given a multi-month breakout above the Rs 4,000 level on the daily chart with strong volume, while on the weekly chart it has broken an upward-sloping channel formation. The structure of the counter is very lucrative, as it is trading above all of its moving averages. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) supports the current strength, and the momentum indicator RSI (Relative Strength Index) is also positively poised. On the higher side, Rs 4,200 acts as a resistance level; above this, we can expect a move towards Rs 4,300+ in the shorter to longer timeframe, while on the lower side, Rs 3,800 serves as important support during any correction. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,300 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,800 Zen Technologies | CMP: Rs 1,436  On the shorter horizon, Zen Technologies is exhibiting traditional bullish momentum and forming higher highs and higher lows. On the longer horizon, it has broken a Flag formation with a large volume. The counter has a lucrative structure as it is trading above all of its significant moving averages. The momentum indicator RSI is positively poised, and the MACD is witnessing a centerline crossover on the upside. On the higher side, Rs 1,500 is acting as an important psychological level; above this, we can expect the level of Rs 1,550+ in the near-short term, while on the lower side, Rs 1,340 will act as major support during any correction. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,564 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,340 Welspun Living | CMP: Rs 178  Welspun Living has seen a breakout of a Cup and Handle formation on the longer timeframe with massive volume, which appears profitable. The structure of the counter looks lucrative, as it is trading above all its important moving averages. On the upper side, Rs 190 is an immediate resistance; above this, we can expect a big move till Rs 195+ in the shorter timeframe, while on the downside, Rs 167 is the demand zone for any correction. The momentum indicator RSI is also positively poised, and the MACD supports the current strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 194 Stop-Loss: Rs 167 Mehul Kothari, DVP – Technical Research at Anand Rathi Latent View Analytics | CMP: Rs 534.5  For many months, Latent View Analytics has been consolidating above the placement of its 200 DEMA (Exponential Moving Average). As a result, we are witnessing multiple bottoms at lower levels, which indicates that the downside is limited. Recently, the stock confirmed a breakout above Rs 567, followed by a pullback. The risk-reward looks lucrative to go long. Thus, we advise traders to buy Latent View Analytics near Rs 530 with a stop-loss of Rs 490 for a target of Rs 610 in the coming months. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 610 Stop-Loss: Rs 490 Chennai Petroleum Corporation | CMP: Rs 1,030  Most petroleum stocks underwent a sharp rally during the first half of July 2024. Then we witnessed some profit booking. As a result, Chennai Petroleum has retraced over 50 percent of the recent rally and now we are witnessing a reversal candlestick pattern on the daily scale. Thus, we advise traders to go long in the stock in the range of Rs 1,030 – 1,010 for a target of Rs 1,250 in the coming months. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,250 Stop-Loss: Rs 900 IndiaMART InterMESH | CMP: Rs 2,856  Similar to Latent View, IndiaMART InterMESH confirmed a fresh range breakout above Rs 2,880 during the last week. Afterward, the stock retraced the previous rally and turned from the short-term moving average. The theoretical target for the range breakout is quite higher, and hence the fall could be a buying opportunity. We advise traders to go long in the stock near Rs 2,850 for a target of Rs 3,250 in the coming months. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,250 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,650 Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Hindustan Unilever | CMP: Rs 2,735.3  HUL has taken off its previous swing high of Rs 2,724 and has seen significant short covering from the lower end, followed by good long built up as well. The momentum indicator MACD is well in the buy mode on the daily as well as weekly chart, indicating that the short-term trend is positive. Since the stock has provided a breakout from the symmetrical triangular pattern, a good directional move is expected on the upside. Generally, July and August are good months for FMCG stocks, so it’s likely to perform positively. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,830, Rs 2,900 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,640 Mphasis | CMP: Rs 2,926  Mphasis has been forming higher tops and higher bottoms on the weekly charts. It has recently taken off its crucial resistance of Rs 2,850, and now above these levels, there is no major hurdle until Rs 3,150, and above that Rs 3,400 looks likely. The stock had also risen in an impulsive wave from Rs 1,660 to Rs 2,838 levels, and now with this breakout, another impulse wave seems to have started on the upside. The stock has also witnessed good long built up in the short term, and the entire sector has seen a good reversal from the lower levels except for Wipro so far, which has delivered poor performance. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,150, Rs 3,400 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,825 Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"Travel &amp; tourism sector hopes for infrastructure status, GST Reforms in Budget 2024",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/travel-tourism-sector-hopes-for-infrastructure-status-gst-reforms-in-budget-2024-12774862.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 12:31 AM","The travel and tourism sector is eagerly anticipating several measures in Budget 2024, including the grant of infrastructure status, Goods and Services Tax (GST) rationalization, changes to Leave Travel Allowance (LTA) rules, and incentives aimed at boosting local destinations. On July 22, Oriental Hotels, Asian Hotels, Chalet Hotels, and Indian Hotels were the major gainers as they rose 4.0-7.3 percent. EaseMyTrip, IRCTC, and Yatra Online were up 0.1-4.0 percent. Also Read | Indian Hotels jumps 7% on healthy Q1 results; stock up 40% so far this year Amit Jain, Founder of Magicfares, highlighted that the growing demand for hospitality services, busy airports, and popular travel spots underscore the sector's vital role in economic expansion. Jain believes that increasing travel-related tax exemptions could encourage higher spending on travel by consumers. He also emphasizes the need for GST adjustments to make hotel stays more affordable for tourists. Jain advocates for including hotel stays under LTA expenses and providing corporate incentives for hosting meetings and conferences in India, either through partial or full tax exemptions on expenses, to further stimulate domestic tourism. Axis Securities noted India's potential to become a leading global tourism hub. According to a report by the India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF), the travel and tourism market in India is expected to generate $23.72 billion in 2024, with a projected annual growth rate of 9.6 percent over the next four years. The sector has rebounded significantly post-pandemic, with foreign and domestic travel numbers returning to pre-COVID levels. Also Read | Growth set to slow to 6.5-7% in FY25; Eco Survey asks corporates to pick the baton on job creation The interim Union Budget allocated approximately Rs 2,450 crores to the sector, a 44.7 percent increase from previous allocations, aimed at boosting employment and tourism growth. Despite the recent upturn in hotel stocks due to strong demand, challenges such as a severe heat wave and election disruptions during the April-June quarter impacted recreational spending. Nevertheless, domestic aviation traffic remained resilient, rising 4.4 percent year-on-year in May. Stocks of companies like Chalet Hotels, Lemon Tree Hotels, IRCTC, Safari Industries, and Interglobe Aviation have surged between 9-44 percent over the past six months. ICRA reports steady growth in the hotel sector, with high demand outpacing supply. CRISIL Ratings projects robust revenue growth of 11-13 percent for the Indian hotel industry in FY25, suggesting the sector will continue its positive momentum into the new fiscal year.

Street remain optimistic on increase in defence capex spend,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/street-remain-optimistic-on-increase-in-defence-capex-spend-12774797.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 12:31 AM","The defence sector continues to be an investor favourite, as stocks continue to rise on  expectations of increased allocation for defence capex in the upcoming budget and a continued thrust on domestic production of armaments. Defence has over the last few budgets, been on high priority. India is the fourth largest military spender globally. As per latest data from Stockholm International Peace Institute, in 2023, at $83.6 billion, India’s military expenditure was 4.2 per cent higher than in 2022. In the interim budget announced in February, the defence budget for the current financial year was increased to Rs 6.21 lakh crore, with around Rs 1.7 lakh crore of it towards capex. With government finances in a much better position than what they were in January, investors and industry experts are betting that the defence outlay could be bumped up in the July 23 budget as well. On the rise Earlier this month, as per a PIB release, the Ministry of Defence achieved ""the highest-ever growth in indigenous defence production"" to Rs 1.26 lakh crore during FY24, around 17 percent higher than the year before. Krishna Appala, Senior Research Analyst at Capitalmind Research, feels this number could rise to around Rs 1.7 lakh crore this year, including Rs 35,000 crore in exports. ""By 2027, India seeks to achieve 70 percent self-sufficiency in defence,"" Appala told Moneycontrol. Defence reforms on priority Prabhudas Lilladher’s Amit Anwani notes that over the past 7-8 years there have seen significant defence reforms aimed at reducing component imports, creating a robust domestic vendor base, and promoting exports. Some of the notable efforts include mandating foreign players to set up manufacturing in India, transferring technology, and developing homegrown technology through DRDO. “Domestic companies, particularly small and micro private firms, are witnessing rapid growth as they collaborate with DRDO and manufacture import substitute products. Larger OEMs and private sector giants like Tata and Mahindra Defence are also experiencing growth, though at a slower pace than smaller firms,” Anwani added. Budget Expectations In the interim Budget, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) received the highest allocation among ministries, with 27.67 percent for capital expenditure, 14.82 percent for revenue expenditure, 30.68 percent for pay and allowances, 22.72 percent for pensions, and 4.11 percent for civil organizations under MoD. Anil R, Senior Research Analyst at Geojit Financial Services, adds that the interim defense budget has already allocated Rs 1.72 lakh crore for capital expenditure. ""There may be a slight increase, potentially up to Rs 1.9 lakh crore, or even Rs 2 lakh crore,"" he says. Currently, defence spending, as a percentage of GDP, is around 1.9 to 2 percent. But the industry has long advocated for increasing the capital expenditure (CapEx) to 3-4 percent, or even 5 percent, to accelerate modernization. ""Currently, 40-50 percent of inventory across the armed forces is obsolete, necessitating significant investment,"" Anil says. Anwani concurs. “We could see higher allocation to Navy and Airforce in each budget going forward, with defence budgets anticipated to grow slightly higher than GDP at about 7.5-8% annually. This could shift the defence percentage of GDP from 2.4-2.5% to 2.7-2.8% in the next 5-7 years,” he says. Also read: Defence stock valuations on the offensive: Indian stocks three times more expensive than US stocks Stocks to Watch Appala notes that several public sector undertakings (PSUs) and private players are positioned for growth, driven by government initiatives. These companies have strong order books and visibility for the next three to five years. ""Valuations in the defence sector are high, trading at 50-60x P/E FY25, but the market anticipates long-term growth, driven by government support for key sectors like this,"" he says, adding that the market factors in the continuity of government policies, with an expectation of schemes like the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) for domestic players. Anil says that valuations in the defence sector have historically been around 10-20 times earnings but have risen due to government policies, such as the import ban. This has significantly changed valuation multiples. ""Major defence companies have robust order books, but the execution remains a critical factor. The industry's long-term outlook is positive, but near-term valuations are high. Companies like Cochin Shipyard, BEML, and Astra Microwave Products have strong order books, but there are concerns about execution timelines,"" he says, adding that valuations are expected to correct post-budget announcements. Anwani also concurs that while valuations in the defence sector are high, substantial order books and strong growth potential provide a positive long-term outlook. Companies like HAL, Bharat Electronics, and BEML, which have significant defence portfolios, are poised to benefit from continued budget allocations and order inflows.

"Sugar sector hoping for export relief, MSP revision, and ethanol policy changes in Budget 2024",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sugar-sector-hoping-for-export-relief-msp-revision-and-ethanol-policy-changes-in-budget-2024-12774689.html,Market,"July 23, 2024 12:01 AM","Sugar stocks are on a high, fueled by anticipation of favorable measures in the upcoming Union Budget. The industry is optimistic about potential policy changes, including lifting the export ban on sugar, increasing the Minimum Support Price (MSP), and permitting the use of sugar syrup for ethanol production. On July 22, most sugar company stocks saw a marginal rise. Shares of Avadh Sugar, Dhampur Sugar, Dwarikesh Sugar Industries, Balrampur Chini Mills, and Bajaj Hindusthan were up 0.1-1.2 percent at 3 PM. Meanwhile, shares of Dalmia Sugar, Ponni Sugars (E), and Rana Sugars were down  0.2-1.0 percent. Also Read | Fertiliser stocks surge up to 13% a day before Budget on hope of rural focus Deepak Ballani, Director General of the Indian Sugar & Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA), expressed optimism about the upcoming budget, stating, ""The sugar industry eagerly anticipates favorable measures for the Sugar and Bio-Energy sectors in India."" In anticipation of the Union Budget, most sugar stocks have seen significant gains. Companies like KCP Sugar, Shree Renuka Sugars, Balrampur Chini, Rana Sugars, Bajaj Hindusthan Sugar, EID Parry, Triveni Engineering and Industries, and Ponni Sugars (Erode) have increased between 2-18 percent in the past month. Conversely, Ugar Sugar and Simbhaoli Sugars have experienced declines of 3 percent and 5 percent, respectively. ALSO READ: Union Budget 2024 Live Updates The industry is pushing for a higher ethanol procurement price and a more stable policy for sugar import-export and ethanol production. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs has set the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) for sugarcane at Rs 340 per quintal for the 2024-25 season, marking an 8 percent increase from the previous season. This new FRP will be effective from October 1. Follow our live blog for all the market action Centrum Broking noted that the initial MSP for sugar, set at Rs 29 per kg in 2018 and raised to Rs 31 per kg in 2019, is overdue for revision. Although current market prices exceed the MSP (Rs 36 in Maharashtra and Rs 39 in UP), an increase would provide a new baseline and boost investor confidence. Elara Securities, however, does not expect any immediate action on the MSP or sugar export restrictions in the next 5-6 months, given the resilience of sugar prices and strong company profitability. The brokerage maintains a neutral short-term outlook but is optimistic about the sector’s medium-to-long-term prospects, driven by the Ethanol Blending Program (EBP). The EBP aims to promote ethanol use in petrol to reduce fuel imports, conserve foreign exchange, and enhance the industry’s value. Ballani emphasized the need to stabilize sugarcane production to meet EBP targets and leverage existing government schemes with a budget allocation of Rs 37,996 crore for 2024-29 to improve sugarcane yield and expand cultivation areas. DAM Capital warned that any permanent changes to ethanol blending policies or molasses quota obligations might negatively impact sentiment in sugar stocks.

"Trading Plan: Will Nifty manage to hit 25,000, Bank Nifty 53,000 on budget day?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/budget/trading-plan-will-nifty-manage-to-hit-25000-bank-nifty-53000-on-budget-day-12775268.html,Market,"July 22, 2024 11:55 PM","Bulls remained cautious as the market approached the Union Budget scheduled for July 23. The Nifty 50 saw a lower high-lower low formation with negative momentum indicators on daily charts, although it defended 24,500 and the 21-day EMA on July 22. Experts see support at the 24,200-24,000 zone and resistance at 24,850-25,000, while for the Bank Nifty, breaking either side of the 52,000-52,800 range can give firm direction in the coming sessions. On Monday, the Nifty 50 was down 22 points at 24,509, and the Bank Nifty gained 15 points at 52,280. On the NSE, 1,345 shares advanced, while 1,038 shares declined. Nifty Outlook and Strategy Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Technically, the Nifty had formed a Shooting Star candlestick pattern on the last weekly charts, which is a bearish reversal sign, and the momentum indicator MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) has also gone into sell mode on the daily charts, thus confirming the same. Now, the weekly momentum is still in buy mode, so the index may slip into a range in this crucial budget week. Historically, the range for the Nifty on Budget day is between +2 percent to -2 percent. At approximately 24,500 levels, the range for the index is 24,000 to 25,000 levels. Looking at the current week’s derivatives data, the maximum Call open interest is at the 25,000 level, whereas the maximum Put open interest is at the 24,000 level. Hence, the range is 24,000 to 25,000. The VWAP (volume weighted average price) is in the 24,350 to 24,400 range, which will act as short-term support, and the maximum pain is at 24,500, whereas modified maximum pain is at 24,667. Therefore, the resistance on the upside is approximately 24,700. Hence, the short-term range will be 24,350 to 24,700 within a broader range of 24,000 to 25,000 levels. Key Resistance: 24,700, 25,000 Key Support: 24,350, 24,000 Strategy: Sell below 24,350, with a target of 24,000 and 23,800, and a stop-loss of 24,550. Mehul Kothari, DVP – Technical Research at Anand Rathi Going into the budget session, the markets could be highly volatile as the street seems to be sceptical about the steps that might be taken to curb retail participation in the markets. However, structure-wise, we don’t see any weakness at this point in time. Support for the session could be around 24,350 – 24,200 for the Nifty 50 in case of a positive budget, and the upside might resume above 24,600. Key Resistance: 24,600, 25,000 Key Support: 24,350, 24,200 Strategy: Buy Nifty above 24,600, with a stop-loss of 24,400, and a target of 25,000. Pravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst at Swastika Investmart A decisive move below 24,500 on the Nifty 50 can lead to further weakness, potentially driving the index towards the 24,000-23,650 range, with intermediate support between 24,250-24,150. On the upside, the 24,800-25,000 range will act as a supply zone. A move above 25,000 could signal a continuation of the rally. Key Resistance: 24,800, 25,000 Key Support: 24,200, 24,000, 23,650 Strategy: Consider buying on dips near 24,200, with a stop-loss at 23,650, and a target of 25,000. Bank Nifty - Outlook and Positioning Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Technically, the Bank Nifty has been consolidating within a range of 51,500 to 53,500 levels which is a downward sloping parallel channel, and the momentum indicator MACD has also gone into sell mode on the daily charts, thus indicating that the short-term trend is down. From the derivatives point of view, 52,000 strike Put has the highest open interest and below that 51,500 strike Put, whereas 52,500 strike Call and 53,000 strike Call has the highest open interest, hence the range is 51,500 to 53,000 levels. The short-term range is 52,000 to 53,000 levels. The Bank Nifty may surprise with a directional move as it has been outperforming the recent and this can lead to a strong breakout either side from hereon. Key Resistance: 52,500, 53,000 Key Support: 52,000, 51,500 Strategy: Sell below 52,300, for a target of 52,000 and 51,500 levels, with a stop-loss of 52,550. Mehul Kothari, DVP – Technical Research at Anand Rathi The Bank Nifty has been stuck in a range of 52,800 – 51,800 for many sessions, and only a breakout or breakdown from this range would dictate the further trend. A fresh rally might commence above 52,800 in the upcoming session. Key Resistance: 52,800, 53,500 Key Support: 51,800, 51,500 Strategy: Buy above 52,800, with a stop-loss at 52,200, and a target of 54,000. Pravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst at Swastika Investmart For the Bank Nifty index, there is immediate and crucial support at 52,000. A decisive move below this level can lead to further weakness towards the 51,000 mark. On the upside, the 52,800-53,000 range serves as a critical resistance zone. A breakout above this level could trigger a rally towards the 53,500-54,000 range. Key Resistance: 53,000, 53,500, 54,000 Key Support: 52,000, 51,000 Strategy: Buy on dips near 52,000, with a stop-loss at 51,000, and a target of 54,000.

Given that the government's current healthcare spend sits at around 3 percent of the GDP, lower than global standards, prompting brokerages like Prabhudas Lilladher to anticipate a likely increased allocation for the sector in the upcoming Budget. For context, other economies  the US, UK, France, Germany, Japan, China and South Korea spend 7-17 percent of their total GDP on healthcare. Aside from increased healthcare allocation, the industry also expects the government to announce measures to support R&D within the sector. ""India's pharmaceutical R&D investment currently at 8-10 percent of its revenues, which is lower than the global average of 15-20 percent. Enhanced tax breaks and R&D funding may drive industrial innovation, allowing us to compete worldwide and contribute to the 'Make in India' goals,"" said Dr. Satish Wagh, Chairman & Managing Director, Supriya Lifesciences.

A major expectation is granting industry status to the real estate sector. This would simplify access to funding and attract foreign investments, thereby enhancing liquidity and project execution. In terms of affordable housing and reviving stalled projects, additional funding through the SWAMIH scheme and new subsidy schemes, such as the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), are anticipated. Revising the definition and upper limit of affordable housing to match current market conditions would also improve affordability. Also Read | Budget 2024: Auto sector foresee key policy measures to drive growth, innovation and sustainability Regarding tax benefits, key revisions expected include adjusting tax slab rates, increasing the standard deduction, raising deduction limits for home loan interest, and reducing the long-term capital gains tax rate to make real estate investments more appealing. Another critical reform expected is the digitization of land records to enhance transparency, minimize disputes, and streamline transactions. Required Reforms An increased allocation for PMAY is essential to boost demand in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. Implementing an “Interest Subvention Scheme” for middle-class housing could encourage homeownership among this segment. Revising income tax rates and raising the limit for eligible home loan interest deductions to at least Rs 3 lakh, along with removing the Rs 2 lakh cap on interest set-off against salary for rented or deemed-to-be-let-out properties, would significantly benefit homeowners. Realty Stocks on Radar The real estate sector has performed exceptionally well in 2024, with strong demand improving cash flows and strengthening the balance sheets of property developers. This has led to increased investor interest in realty shares, driving key stocks to record highs. The Nifty Realty index has surged 38 percent so far this year. Axis Securities anticipates continued emphasis on affordable housing schemes and digital infrastructure improvements, which would benefit major real estate companies. They recommend stocks such as Prestige Estates, Macrotech Developers, and Godrej Properties. Additionally, data center-focused companies like Anant Raj and urban developers like MICL and TARC are expected to perform well. Also Read | Fintechs seek regulatory clarity and certainty, uniform KYC rules from Budget 2024-25 Fisdom also predicts increased funding for affordable housing and the development of satellite townships near metro cities to enhance urban infrastructure.

The surge in speculation: Can the Budget solve this social problem?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/the-surge-in-speculation-can-the-budget-solve-this-social-problem-12774748.html,Market,"July 22, 2024 05:39 PM","By Puneet Sharma, CEO and Fund Manager, Whitespace Alpha The Indian stock market has seen a surge in retail investors pouring in their money. This is both a good and bad thing. Good, because equities as an asset class are hard to beat. Bad, because several of them are not financially savvy enough, and have had their fingers badly burnt by dabbling in instruments and products they have little understanding about. Futures and options or F&Os is a case in point. That also raises the question of whether the authorities should step in to ringfence these investors, and if doing so raises the spectre of the nanny state or, perhaps worse, the command economy. Can the budget Solve F&O craze? There is a temptation in any government to play godfather. It is the realm of a socialist country to believe that governance is the superior solution to a free market. Recent comments from regulators and the powers to be have had similar undertones. Let us understand the issue at play here: the total trading volume in the futures and options or F&O segment in 2019 stood at Rs 87 lakh crore and went up to Rs 126 lakh crore in 2023. However, retail traders took a hit as nine out of 10 among them incurred losses, averaging Rs 1.1 lakh during FY22 as per a Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) report published in January 2023. Click Here To Read All Budget Related News So, does the government need to step in to tame these developments? I don't think so. It is natural that retail investors who step into this market for the first time will feel the heat compared to more seasoned players who come in with far higher risk tolerance and sophistication, but this is true for any foray in this sector. A lot of first-time investors in equity also pick up penny stocks trying to make a quick buck but graduate to more stable investments in pooled funds. In the F&O space, retail investors may lose but they will take with them much-needed experience and a taste of what they can do better next time. Also read: Economic Survey 2024: Govt unveils 'Amrit Kaal' growth strategy, here are 6 key focus areas Maybe they will want to park their funds with funds that take F&O exposure. Maybe they will decide to learn better before trying next time. It is their choice, who are we to try and decide for them? And remember, every once in a while, one of these retail investors will come up with a strategy that will stand the test of time. That is how we started. That is how innovation happens, that is the benefit of a liberal economy. You have to unleash the animal spirits. There can be some blood spilt but that will also encourage innovation and bring in managers who can oversee global money, direct more capital flows to India and realise the scope of innovation hubs like GIFT City,  the planned financial hub in Gujarat. Also read: Economic Survey pegs FY25 GDP growth at 6.5-7% This will take vision, this will take political will, this will take a more libertarian outlook to markets. The votebank may actually welcome it. But we are a socialist country. We like our government telling us what to do. We like to be told what language to speak, what food to eat, what clothes to wear and what sectors we trade in. Let us see if the budget tries to fix what is not broken! Sharing our views on some of the policy changes mooted in the public Categorising gains as speculative incomeThe beauty of this lies in the paradox. First you say 1 percent of investors are consistently making money and then you say it is speculative. It would be policy made by people who do not understand the turf if something like this were to be announced. Introduction of TDS on F&O incomeIntroducing tax deducted at source (TDS) on F&O income might discourage speculative trading among retail individual traders. We believe this will only increase red tape rather than do anything meaningful to protect investors. Reducing long-term capital gains leviesThird, as we mature into a developed market economy, the government could consider rationalising long-term gains tax. Higher taxes on long-term gains may inadvertently increase the appeal of speculative trading, as traders and advisors will look for short-term opportunities to maximise returns. We shouldn't throw the baby out with the bathwater and end up stifling retail participation altogether. As an asset management company, we have participated in and contributed to the development of the Indian markets and hope to see it as a leading market for financial prudence as well as innovation.

"MC Interview: Nifty may find it hard to cross 25,000, but rally likely to continue in IT, FMCG indices, says Milan Vaishnav",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/mc-interview-nifty-may-find-it-hard-cross-25000-but-rally-likely-to-continue-in-it-fmcg-indices-says-milan-vaishnav-12774123.html,Market,"July 22, 2024 05:23 PM","""There are very less chances that the Nifty will climb and move beyond the 25,000 level soon,"" Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA, founder of Gemstone Equity Research & Advisory Services said in an interview to Moneycontrol. Among sectors, he definitely thinks that the Nifty IT index is likely to see a big rally. ""With the index rolling inside the improving Quadrant of the RRG (Relative Rotation Graphs), it is likely to improve its relative performance against the broader markets,"" he said. Further, according to Milan who spent nearly two decades in the capital markets, the rally is expected to continue in Nifty FMCG. Will the Nifty 50 go beyond 25,000 mark soon? There are Yes and No for this. The markets are trending higher; as of now they show no signs of any weakness. However, we cannot also ignore and overlook the fact that the markets stay highly overextended and remain significantly deviated from the mean. From a technical perspective and going by the derivatives data, the level of 25,000 can get tested but there are very less chances that the Nifty will climb and move beyond the 25,000 level. What is your trading strategy for the index given the overbought conditions? I would stick to my basics; given the current uptrend, of course I will keep following the trend. However, at the same time, I would effectively trail my stop-loss in a way that if they are triggered then I am able to protect the bulk of my profits. Also, I would focus more on guarding profits at current levels and will keep fresh buying limited to those stocks that show improving relative strength and promising technical structure. I would avoid giving a blind chase the the stocks that have already moved much ahead of their curve. Do you expect the Bank Nifty to see a breakout for a target of 53,000 after current consolidation? Bank Nifty remains relatively weaker; the pattern support is at 52,050. If this is violated, we may see some incremental weakness in this pocket. Having said this, the last phase of the upmove in Nifty Bank Index had come with a strong bearish divergence of the RSI (Relative Strength Index) against the price. This makes the level of 53,000 an immediate top for the index. This level may get tested if there is a strong move but it is unlikely that this will get taken out soon. Do you think the Nifty IT is soon going to see a big rally? Yes, I definitely think so and I have multiple reasons to support my view. From a short-term perspective, the Nifty IT Index has seen a sharp improvement in its Relative Momentum when benchmarked against the broader Nifty 500 Index. With the Index rolling inside the Improving Quadrant of the RRG (Relative Rotation Graphs), it is likely to improve its relative performance against the broader markets. Furthermore, the recent rally has taken the index to its recent highs; but it has also seen retesting the levels that were seen earlier in 2022. Above 39,500 level will lead to a multi-year breakout in this Index. Some consolidation cannot be ruled out but eventually Nifty IT Index is staring at a major breakout. Will the rally continue in Nifty FMCG which recently saw a breakout? Yes, the rally is expected to continue in Nifty FMCG; this would be more likely if the markets in general show some signs of consolidation. Otherwise, the index is a bit overextended on both daily and weekly charts. However, while some consolidation cannot be ruled out, the rally can definitely extend itself as the primary uptrend stays very much intact.

"Why a populist Budget won’t be bad, after all",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/budget/why-a-populist-budget-wont-be-bad-after-all-12774703.html,Market,"July 22, 2024 05:16 PM","By Divam Sharma, Founder and Fund Manager at Green Portfolio Populist budgets don’t necessarily need to be bad, nor do they need to please everyone. The budget back in February was nothing close to being populist, but now we might see some populist measures as the government tries to gain public confidence and support. Let’s look at things from a couple of different perspectives. First off, consumption. A populist budget can really help improve consumption spending, particularly in rural areas. We have seen FMCG staying muted during most of FY24. So, a populist budget can be beneficial as it would help in the revival of demand from the rural side in FMCG which has been laggard due to erratic rainfalls impacting the farming industry hence lower consumption from that side. We have already started seeing some green shots here and there in rural consumption, and a good budget would further aid in that growth. Also read: Economic Survey pegs FY25 GDP growth at 6.5-7% It’s all about consumption, we can talk about different sectors but it comes down to consumption for all. The country has been trying to become an electronic hub, and consumption growth can aid in domestic demand for electronics as well. For the auto industry, a subsidy in EVs (electric vehicles) for 2-wheelers and 3-wheelers would push the demand aid in government EV targets and also please consumers. A populist budget can also be really beneficial for the broader economy too. We often talk about the trickle-down effect and GDP multiplier, a populist budget ensures that the money goes down to the masses. These are the ones who spend the money they receive and this in turn ensures a higher GDP multiplier for the economy. These kinds of budgets are focused more on improving the infra and healthcare sectors so that the economy would benefit from the same better roads, bridges, and better healthcare facilities for lower-income populations. We can also expect an increased focus on education, higher education in particular as a measure to focus on the youth of the country which could lead to increased productivity and better quality of talent down the line. Also read: Expenditure on education grew at CAGR 9.4%: Economic Survey 2024 It’s a cycle. Populist budget basically unleashes the animal spirits in consumption. This would help in ensuring good economic momentum in times when there are uncertainties all over the globe. In the case of India, we have seen domestic demand driving the economy when the global economy was under pressure. Higher domestic consumption opportunity drives higher capital in terms of FDI, FII, DII, and retail to markets. Higher amounts of money in hand would lead to more savings and that could aid in the growth of the financial industry and better allocation of funds. Increased consumption and better inflows help expand the overall size of the economy. And again, of course, a populist budget helps the incumbent government to gain back the reduced confidence and ensure continuity with stronger confidence.

The index is unlikely to see a major downside considering the long-term chart structure, although there is some near-term volatility due to the major event. The index defended 24,500 on a closing basis, which, if decisively broken on a closing basis, would make 24,000 the level to watch on the downside. However, 24,860 is the key hurdle on the higher side for a move towards 25,000, experts said. After opening lower, the index traded in the range of 24,595-24,362 during the day and closed 22 points down at 24,509, forming a bullish candlestick pattern with upper and lower shadows on the daily charts, indicating volatility. The momentum indicators RSI (Relative Strength Index) and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) showed a negative bias. ""On the daily charts, we can observe that Nifty has retested the breakout level of 24,400 and has witnessed buying interest. The daily and hourly momentum indicators have a negative crossover, which is a sell signal. Thus, the price is holding on to support while momentum is suggesting weakness,"" Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, said. According to him, given the budget announcement, volatility is expected to be high. ""Crucial support levels to keep handy are 24,265 (20-day moving average) and 24,000 (23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level). On the upside, a breakout above 24,860 can lead to a rise towards 25,530,"" Jatin said. The monthly options data also indicated that 24,000 is expected to be a crucial support for the Nifty, while 24,800-25,000 is likely to be the resistance area. On the Call side, the maximum open interest is placed at the 25,500 strike, followed by the 25,000 and 24,800 strikes, with maximum writing at the 24,500 strike, and then 25,700 and 24,800 strikes. On the Put side, the 24,000 strike holds the maximum open interest, followed by the 23,500 and 24,500 strikes, with maximum writing at the 24,000 strike, and then 24,400 and 23,800 strikes Bank Nifty The Bank Nifty also turned volatile and finished the session at 52,280, up 15 points, forming a bullish candlestick pattern with upper and lower shadows on the daily charts. The index defended 52,000 on a closing basis, which is expected to be crucial for further downside, followed by 51,750, the low of July, whereas 52,800 is likely to be the clear hurdle on the higher side for further uptrend. ""Call writers were active at higher strike prices, indicating limited upside potential. Despite this, Bank Nifty managed to close above its 21-day EMA (52,063), suggesting resilience in the underlying trend,"" Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, said. He further said the view for Bank Nifty remains sideways or rangebound until it breaks key levels, with support at 52,000 and resistance at 52,800. The volatility climbed above all key moving averages ahead of the budget, continuing an uptrend for the fifth consecutive session, giving a bit of discomfort for bulls.

Hong Kong to launch Asia's first inverse bitcoin ETF,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hong-kong-to-launch-asias-first-inverse-bitcoin-etf-12774900.html,Market,"July 22, 2024 04:30 PM","Asia's first inverse bitcoin exchange-traded fund that allows investors to bet on a fall in the cryptocurrency, is set to debut in Hong Kong on Tuesday. Hong Kong's CSOP Asset Management said it will launch the CSOP Bitcoin Futures Daily (-1x) Inverse Product on the city's stock exchange on Tuesday morning. The ETF is expected to take advantage of rising demand to profit from the volatile trading of cryptocurrencies. After the first batch of spot crypto ETFs went public in Hong Kong in April, bitcoin had a bumpy second quarter, losing more than 12%. ""The first futures-based inverse bitcoin product listed in Hong Kong creates opportunities for investors to gain from downside movements in bitcoin,"" said Ding Chen, CEO of CSOP Asset Management in a statement. Bitcoin has been the most erratic among major global assets in the last ten years, with volatility as high as 38.3% in 2023, surpassing crude oil and the Nasdaq 100, the company added. Bitcoin rebounded strongly in the past few weeks on increased expectations that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump would regain the White House. It was up slightly and traded at around $67,400 on Monday following U.S. President Joe Biden's decision to quit the presidential race. CSOP's inverse bitcoin product aims to provide a return that closely matches the one-time inverse daily performance of the S&P Bitcoin Futures Index, the firm said. CSOP launched Asia's first bitcoin futures ETF in Hong Kong in 2022. The market value of the ETF grew to more than $100 million due to the global crypto price rally earlier this year, but had dropped to about $58 million as of Friday.

The multinational engaged in EPC projects, Hi-tech manufacturing and services is expected to deliver positive results on a year-on-year (YoY) basis, primarily due to sales growth, robust wins in construction, power T&D and Hydrocarbons.

Capital Gains Tax: Why fix something that ain’t broke,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/budget/capital-gains-tax-why-fix-something-that-aint-broke-12774815.html,Market,"July 22, 2024 03:33 PM","By Tushar Pradhan, Director at Hxgon Partners LLP The first full budget of the third term of the BJP government and the first of the coalition government is the subject of much debate already. There are various wishlists that industry bodies, corporates and individuals have prepared and are keenly looking at the fine print at the incoming budget. While it is a full budget, as opposed to an interim budget going into the elections in February, it will also be pertinent to note that in view of only a part of the year now being covered the government may decide to keep the policy oriented and major announcements for next February. Having said that, certain headlines point to some very sensitive issues especially connected to the capital markets, that have grabbed attention lately. While much of the speculation should rightfully border around the overall growth orientation, revenue maximisation and social equity addressed in the budget as main thrusts, the more controversial issue is the one relating to capital gains tax. There is speculation that there may be a change in the rate, or the holding period to determine short or long term for investments in equity and equity related instruments. Such a change if enacted may have an outsized impact on the market as sentiment in the short term is more impactful than the actual outcome. Also read: Economic Survey pegs FY25 GDP growth at 6.5-7% It will be interesting to note the reason why differential tax rates exists between income tax rates and capital gains tax in the first place. In a country that was starved of investment from its own public, the challenge was for providing capital for its growing industrial infrastructure needs by way of incentivising longer term investments by providing a tax arbitrage. If investors are willing to put their savings to work for a longer term, they should be adequately compensated for such allocation that not only satisfies the need for capital formation without additional outlay by the government or its agencies but also provides for a healthy return for deferring the outcome to investors. The capital gains tax globally also follows a similar pattern. For example, in the US, the long-term capital gains tax rates for the 2023 and 2024 tax years are 0%, 15%, or 20% of the profit, depending on the income of the filer. Please note, lower income filers get the benefit of zero capital gains tax there. Click Here To Read All Budget Related News This debate that these tax rates confer some undeserved advantage to investors while the employed majority is paying a higher tax rate is erroneous. The twin advantages of capital formation, employment of private capital for longer term usage is a needed measure for the government to see a lighter load on itself to provide the same. The short-term capital gains tax also is set higher to discourage speculation. Having increased the LTCG from zero to 10 percent and introducing differential rates for debt mutual funds and elongating the term for defining such gains, the government has already done its bit to disincentivise such investments to a certain degree. To change this picture for the worse will be sheer folly. This kind of signaling will sour investor sentiment and the booming equity cult that has recently formed will thus die a premature death. India needs long term investments, and such investments need the support of the government. Investments are not without risk and the just reward for patience is by way of such differential rates and in the larger interest should remain as status quo. After all, don’t fix it if it ain’t broke! Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

According to Avani Bhatt, Vice President of Derivative Research at JM Financial, ""From here on, price moves are expected to be more rationalized and range-bound. India VIX is expected to gradually cool off to the 11-13 percent range in the August series."" Avani adds, ""A lot of factors have changed on the economic, political, and sentiment fronts from the period of the interim budget to the final budget, leading to a high probability of a more accommodative and populist budget. Markets have factored in this scenario and seen a very good recovery of nearly 15% on Nifty from the panic lows of National Election Day."" In context of this view, Bhatt recommends an Iron Fly strategy for the 29th August monthly expiry: Strategy for 29th August expiry: - Sell 24500 CE at Rs 530-540- Sell 24500 PE at Rs 380-390- (Combined premium of 910-930) - Buy 25400 CE at Rs 150-160- Buy 23600 PE at Rs 130-140 Net Premium Inflow: 630-650 Margin Required: Approx Rs 53,000 Target: 500 pointsStop Loss: 250 points  About Short Iron Fly: It is an advanced options strategy that involves selling an at-the-money call and put (forming a straddle) and buying an out-of-the-money call and put (forming wings). This strategy is designed to profit from low volatility and the passage of time, aiming to capture the premium received from selling the straddle while limiting potential losses with the wings. The maximum profit occurs if the underlying asset's price remains near the strike price of the sold options, while losses are capped due to the protective positions of the purchased options.

Low float companies: Why these should be on the government’s divestment list,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/low-float-companies-why-these-should-be-on-the-governments-divestment-list-12774795.html,Market,"July 22, 2024 03:12 PM","By Varun Lohchab, Head of Institutional Research at HDFC Securities The BSE PSU Index has doubled in the last one year as PSU stocks have been witnessing unprecedented rerating reflecting investors’ confidence on government strategy of bringing investment-led growth in the country. In our view, this is a suitable time for the government to capitalise on the market optimism and monetise its stake in certain low-float PSU stocks. Out of 73 listed public sector entities, government shareholding is more than 75 percent for 16 of them. These are low-float PSUs with poor liquidity and sub-optimal price discovery, which leads to a mismatch between supply and demand resulting in overblown stock prices even with modest buying activity. As per our analysis, total market capitalisation of these sixteen companies is around Rs 14 lakh crore. Hypothetically, if the government were to divest stake in these companies and bring their holdings down to 75 percent, it could fetch them Rs 2.58 lakh crore, which would be potent enough to reduce estimated FY25 fiscal deficit of India by 15 percent (or 78 bps of FY25E GDP). This can prove to be a catalyst in achieving the government’s ambitious fiscal deficit target of 4.5 percent by FY26. Furthermore, this will help lift sovereign rating of the country. Apart from reducing the fiscal deficit, the proceeds can also prove to be instrumental in supporting the ongoing infrastructure creation drive of the government or launching social welfare programs for rural Indians. Click Here To Read All Budget Related News Looking from the other perspective, this divestment will help in better price discovery and liquidity improvement of these low-float stocks which will reduce volatility in their prices. A stable price regime will attract more long-term institutional money, which will provide the underlying company the flexibility to implement its growth strategies. Eventually, growth in such companies will benefit the government in the long run in the form of increased dividends, taxes, and appreciation in the holding value. Within PSU stocks with more than 75 percent government holding, two insurance stocks namely LIC and GIC have approximately doubled in the last twelve months. In addition, Nifty PSU Bank Index has tripled in the last three years. Also, the financial health of these companies has drastically improved as well. In such a scenario, when, valuation and fundamentals both are in favour for these PSU companies, it is an appropriate time for divestment. As the government has missed its divestment targets for last four years consecutively, it makes all the sense to take advantage of current euphoric optimism around PSU stocks and monetise its stake in various companies. Furthermore, some planned strategic sales in companies such as IDBI Bank, Shipping corporation, Container corporation, BEML and NMDC steel, which got delayed due to subdued market conditions earlier, could take place comfortably in the current conducive environment. Also read: Expenditure on education grew at CAGR 9.4%: Economic Survey 2024 We believe, in the current context, challenges faced by the government in its earlier attempts of PSU divestments in past can be suitably addressed. For example, the wide apprehension of past years that large PSU divestments may result into crowding out of the private sector isn’t a significant fear currently, given salience of strong domestic flows. Further, with respect to divestment, another concern has been that the equity dilution of government stake in PSUs in favour of foreign entities may result into a decline in national wealth. However, in the current scenario, the domestic market is well developed and deep that a planned periodic equity sale by PSU companies can be easily absorbed by domestic institutions and wealthy individual investors. Hence, it can ensure that there is no overseas migration of national wealth. Also, partial divestment of government stake doesn’t take away its economic power over the governance of the company, hence welfare of the employees is also not compromised. Also read: Economic Survey pegs FY25 GDP growth at 6.5-7% Hence, overall, we believe partial divestment of low-float public sector companies is appropriate in the current context and has the potential to bring efficiency, better/ethical management practices, governance, and improved monitoring for the involved companies. Additionally, the sale proceeds will go a long way in improving the country’s financial health.

"HUL's Q1 results seen muted, eye on segmental sales and heatwave impact",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/hindustan-unilever-fmcg-profit-price-cut-12774554.html,Market,"July 22, 2024 02:44 PM","The intense heatwave, price cuts and stable commodity prices are expected to support FMCG giant Hindustan Unilever post a flat quarter of earnings on July 23, according to analysts who track the company closely. According to a Moneycontrol poll of nine brokerages, Hindustan Unilever is likely to report a flat revenue growth, higher by one percent on-year at Rs 15,205 crore. Net profit is likely to come in at Rs 2,512 crore versus Rs 2,500 crore seen in the corresponding quarter last year.  Earnings estimates of analysts polled by Moneycontrol are in a narrow range, and any positive or negative surprise may trigger a sharp reaction in the stock. The most optimistic estimate sees India’s largest consumer staples firm HUL’s net profit jumping five percent on-year, but the most pessimistic projection suggests that net profit might sink five percent, such has been the divergence. Factors Impacting the Earnings HUL's revenue is likely to remain flat on account of subdued performance across categories, mainly impacted by price cuts, said Axis Securities. Volume Growth: The overall demand for HUL's products is seen muted in Q1FY25, with underlying volume growth seen in single-digits, according to brokerages. However, volumes in 75 percent of HUL’s business are growing. The FMCG major is likely to boost its volume growth in FY25 and FY26, said Motilal Oswal. Segmental Performance: Across segments, the performance is likely to vary with HUL's home care business likely growing at two percent, while beauty and personal care revenue expected to fall because of price cuts. HUL's Food portfolio, especially tea, coffee, and functional nutrition drinks, may be affected by a tough summer. Prabhudas Lilladher said, “We expect strong performance in Laundry while OOH consumption and hot beverages might be weak.” EBITDA margins: While gross margins are expected to expand in the range of 120-160 basis points, while HUL’s EBITDA margin is likely to contract by 10 basis points due to higher advertisement spends, royalty payout, and the termination of GSK consignment sale. What to Look Out For? Analysts will closely monitor demand in metro areas and tier-3 towns, the effect of raw material prices on EBITDA margins, as well as the growing competitive pressure from unorganized players.

F&O minimum lot size should be increased to deter casual retail investors: Experts,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/fo-minimum-lot-size-should-be-increased-to-deter-casual-retail-investors-experts-12774492.html,Market,"July 22, 2024 02:42 PM","Increasing the minimum lot size for futures and options (F&O) contracts would be an ideal way to cool the unbridled speculation by amateur retail traders in the equity derivatives segment, said market experts during a panel discussion on CNBC-TV18. Earlier this month, Moneycontrol had reported that the Working Committee on Futures and Options has recommended increasing the minimum lot size of derivative contracts to Rs 20 lakh-Rs 30 lakh from Rs 5 lakh presently. Deepak Shenoy of Capital Minds believes that F&O lot sizes have not increased in sync with GDP and market growth. According to Shenoy, ""Having a Rs 20 lakh lot size would be appropriate."" Shenoy also suggested reducing the number of expiries to one per week. At present, there is a weekly contract expiry on every day of the week. Rajesh Baheti from Crosseas Capital proposed a targeted approach to reduce retail participation in F&O trading. ""Steps should be targeted only at the retail segment and not damage the overall market sentiment. Market lot size adjustment would be the best way of addressing retail speculation,"" said Baheti. Last week, SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch said the regulator was compelled to warn against speculative bets in the futures and options (F&O) segment because it has become a ""macro issue"". Speaking at an event organised by SBI Mutual Fund, the regulator said the shift from savings to “speculative” activity was affecting the broader economy now. A good chunk of household financial savings are going into the speculative bets, depriving the real economy of much needed capital. In addition, youngsters were losing tonnes of money on such bets, Buch said. Speaking in the same discussion, Jimit Modi of Samco Securities quoted NSE data showing 4.0-4.5 million individuals participating in the options segment.

Speculative trading has no place in a developing country like India: Economic Survey,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/f-investors-may-face-serious-losses-warns-economic-survey-12774645.html,Market,"July 22, 2024 03:13 PM","The Economic Survey has come down heavily on rising futures & options in the stock market by retail investors, using harshest words yet by a government agency, going as far to say that such speculative trading has “no place in a developing country” such as India. More importantly, it has warned the that any potential fall in stock markets could make investors feel cheated and deter them from returning to capital markets for a long time which could be detrimental to the entire economy. The Survey noted that derivatives trading, with its potential for outsized gains, often appeals to the human instinct for gambling and the allure of augmenting income. This dynamic has driven significant retail participation in derivatives trading. However, the reality of derivatives trading is starkly different from its promise. ""Globally, derivatives trading loses money for investors, for the most part,"" the survey states. The allure of quick profits can be misleading, as the majority of participants in derivatives markets end up facing losses. This underscores the importance of raising investor awareness and continuous financial education. The survey emphasizes, ""Raising investor awareness and continuous financial education is essential to warn them of the low or negative expected returns from derivatives trading."" Also read | F&O crackdown: Panel suggests sweeping curbs on options contracts, lot sizes The risks associated with derivatives trading are not merely theoretical. A significant stock market correction can lead to substantial losses, particularly for retail investors engaged in derivatives. These losses could provoke a strong negative behavioral response, with investors feeling ""cheated by unseen more considerable forces."" The Economic Survey warns that such experiences could deter retail investors from returning to capital markets for a long time, which would be detrimental to both their financial well-being and the broader economy. The Economic Survey also provides a broader context for understanding the potential pitfalls of rapid financialisation. It points to historical precedents, noting, ""The financialisation of economies has not ended well, even for advanced economies. The global financial crisis of 2008 is an obvious example."" For developing countries, the risks are even more pronounced. The survey cites the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98, which severely impacted the high-flying economies of the region. These examples illustrate the dangers when financial market innovations and growth outpace economic growth. Also read | F&O frenzy in equities now turning into a stampede, warns Vijay Kedia For India, the survey advocates for a cautious approach: ""India needs to have an orderly and gradual evolution of the financial market."" Such an approach is essential to avoid the destabilizing effects that have plagued other economies. The survey calls on all stakeholders, including market participants, market infrastructure institutions, regulators, and the government, to ensure that capital markets fulfill their fundamental role of directing savings to productive investments. This is not only a matter of national interest but also of self-interest. The survey concludes, ""All stakeholders must ensure that capital markets play their theoretically assigned role of directing savings to their most productive investments. It is not just in the national interest. It is an act of self-interest, too."" Earlier this month, Moneycontrol reported that a SEBI working committee on F&O has proposed measures to curb the rapid growth in derivatives volume. These include increasing the minimum lot size of derivative contracts to Rs 20 lakh-Rs 30 lakh from the current Rs 5 lakh, restricting weekly options to one expiry per stock exchange per week, and limiting the number of strike prices for options contracts. Last week, SEBI chairperson Buch said that the worry for the regulator is now not just from a “micro level” of the F&O trading putting investors at risk, but also from a “macro level” of it disrupting economic growth. Buch said that turnover in index options in premium terms has gone up from Rs 4.5 lakh crore in 2018 to Rs 140 lakh crore in 2024. While overall turnover in the derivatives segment has gone up from Rs 210 lakh crore in 2018 to Rs 500 lakh crore in 2024.

Chemical players bet on hopes of PLI to give manufacturing boost,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/chemical-players-bet-on-hopes-of-pli-to-give-manufacturing-boost-12774551.html,Market,"July 22, 2024 02:26 PM","Even though the sector is caught in the midst of a rough patch, chemical companies are hoping for finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will give the industry something to cheer on in the form of production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme in the upcoming Budget. The industry has been grappling with weak demand and an influx of low-cost Chinese inventory in global markets over the past year. A recovery seems imminent, except in agrochemicals, where the outlook remains unclear. Many analysts predict that a rebound should start becoming visible by the second half of this fiscal year. The industry is also counting on government support to maximise this revival. Axis Securities anticipates continued backing through the PLI scheme for chemicals and other tax incentives in chemical manufacturing hubs like Gujarat, benefiting multiple Indian chemical manufacturers. Additionally, analysts Mayank Maheshwari and Vivek Rajamani of Morgan Stanley expect incentives for petrochemicals and the growth of green hydrogen and gas penetration. With the rising demand for electric vehicles (EVs), Axis Securities foresees additional PLI incentives for battery manufacturers and companies involved in electric power production and storage. Prabhudas Lilladher hopes for a government roadmap for renewable manufacturing and higher ethanol blending. For the agrochemical sector, there are expectations that customs duty on imports could be doubled to 20 percent on technicals and 30 percent on formulations, benefiting domestic producers. However, Nuvama analysts see little chance of duty slabs being altered. Also Read | Budget 2024: Pharma firms hope for increased expenditure for healthcare, support for R&D The chemical industry was thriving until 2022, when global demand weakened, and Chinese imports flooded international markets. This downturn coincided with a phase of capital expenditure commissioned by most domestic players, putting margins under severe pressure. Consequently, most brokerages have adopted a cautious stance on the sector. Several chemical stocks, such as SRF, Deepak Nitrite, Gujarat Fluorochemicals, Neogen Chemicals, PI Industries, and Himadri Specialty Chemicals, have are also down in the red year-to-date. Despite this, some signs of recovery are emerging, with a significant rebound in demand expected later this fiscal year. In this context, government support through PLI schemes will be crucial in lifting sentiment for the sector as it moves toward a demand revival.

Over 42 percent of this is engaged in engineering, research, and development (ER&D), 34.5 percent in business process management (BPM), and 23.4 percent in information technology (IT) services. The document also showed that the revenue from India's GCCs has increased from $19.4 billion in FY15 to $46 billion in FY23 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.4 percent. The economic survey said promoting specialisations in higher education is essential to incentivise GCCs in India. It recommended areas such as Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning, Internet of Things, Cybersecurity, Cloud Computing, Big Data Analytics, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, 3D Printing, and Web and Mobile Development. Referring to a survey, the document said about 76 percent of IT employers reported difficulty in finding the skilled talent required globally. The technology sectors are dynamic and continually evolving and IT positions remain among the most in-demand roles in the global job market. “Despite the high demand, these sectors are experiencing a talent gap, with a shortage of IT, data science, and cybersecurity workers,” the document read. Revenue from India's GCCs has increased from $19.4 billion in FY15 to $46 billion in FY23 at a CAGR of 11.4 percent. The document also revealed that ER&D GCC have grown by over 30 percent to about $25 billion in financial year 2022-23. In comparison, the information technology (IT) and business process management (BPM) sectors grew faster in percentage terms but on a smaller base. GCCs within the IT segment grew by 30 percent to $9.7 billion, while the BPM segment grew about 27 percent to $10.7 billion in FY23. Meanwhile, the Economic Survey also said that hiring in the IT sector had slowed down considerably in the last financial year, and even if hiring does not decline further, it is unlikely to pick up significantly. The comment on the IT sector in the Survey comes at a time when headcount in some of the biggest IT companies declined for the first time in decades. In February, tech industry body Nasscom had said the sector will create just 60,000 new jobs in the FY24, which pales in comparison to the 270,000 jobs that the sector created in the previous fiscal year.

She was speaking at an event organised by SBI MF on July 19 to mark its assets under management (AUM) crossing Rs 10 trillion. Buch said that during times when SEBI needed to request government intervention, such as establishing a backstop facility for mutual funds in crisis situations, SBI Mutual Fund was the clear choice to manage these initiatives. Also read: Does your heart beat for the customer, Sebi chief asks mutual fund distributors ""When we wanted to request the government to provide a backstop facility for mutual funds in the event of another crisis and when we wanted to institutionalise it, the simple question was, who will run this? We have said it without any hesitation, SBI MF will run it, who else will run it?"" Buch recounted. ""SBI Mutual Fund has a very special place for the regulator (in that respect). And there are many other instances less publicly known, where again, SEBI relies or has relied on the broad shoulders of SBI Mutual Fund to do in its own way a part of the tremendous responsibility that is cast on us as a regulator,"" she said adding that this was a testament to the culture of the bank, which has manifested in the subsidiary. Buch also praised the culture of the bank, which has manifested in its subsidiary, and thanked every member of the SBI Mutual Fund ""family"" for their support and service with the words, “Tahe dil se shukriya aada karte hai.” (I thank you from the bottom of my heart) Buch added that over the last year, every time she spoke about mutual funds as a product for financial inclusion in the capital markets, and how they want to make micro SIPs and the 250-rupee SIP popular, she knew SBI would be at the forefront.  “I knew that SBI MF is the one mutual fund that can do it”. Buch also praised the fund house for the role it has been playing in ensuring the stability and integrity of India's financial markets. ""By stepping up during times of potential crisis, the fund not only supports the regulator but also bolsters investor confidence, reflecting the strong partnership between SEBI and SBI Mutual Fund in maintaining the robustness of the mutual fund industry,"" she said. Answering a query on whether there is a need for distributors of a particular AMC to sell products of all AMCs, Buch noted: ""A large number of funds with common benchmarks and categories exhibit similar performance. If an entity decides to sell only its group’s funds within this space, it should not be an issue. Different organizations have different strengths. For instance, Motilal Oswal is known for its strong equity brand. If SBI has a strong distribution network, why should they not use it? There is nothing wrong with that."" However, Buch added that selling underperforming funds is mis-selling. ""The system must ensure that this does not happen. I am confident that the SBI group takes care of this issue well,"" she said.

Fertiliser stocks surge up to 13% a day before Budget on hopes of rural focus,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/fertiliser-surge-subsidy-union-budget-12774354.html,Market,"July 22, 2024 12:02 PM","Fertiliser stocks were buzzing in trade, surging as much as 13 percent, in the run-up to the Union Budget 2024 due to be tabled by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 23. The spike in fertiliser stocks came as investors speculate the quantum of subsidy that could be allotted to the sector in the upcoming budget. The interim budget had estimated the fertiliser subsidy requirement for FY25 at Rs 1.64 lakh crore, which is lower than Rs 1.89 lakh crore for FY24. While the Street is not anticipating an increase in the subsidy bill, industry participants are expecting the finance minister may retain the previously estimated subsidy allocation. ""While the budgeted amount is considered to be adequate for FY25 due to moderation in input costs and prices of finished products, the reduced subsidy bill (as compared to FY24) will enable the government to allocate funds to more productive areas,"" Axis Securities wrote in a note. Brokerage expects the government to increase funding towards reducing dependence on fertiliser imports and developing new capabilities such as nano urea. Follow our live blog for all the updates Experts are anticipating greater emphasis on boosting rural consumption, primarily through higher spending on government’s flagship programmes. A rebound in rural consumption should benefit fertiliser companies, as it would likely lead to increased spending by farmers on crop protection. Riding high on these expectations, shares of Deepak Fertilisers, Chambal Fertilisers and Chemicals, National Fertilizers, Gujarat State Fertilizers, Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore (FACT),  and Coromandel International were trading 3-13 percent on the NSE. Fertiliser companies faced disappointing earnings in FY24 due to weak prices, subdued demand, and an influx of low-cost Chinese supplies into the global market. This led to a significant decline in profitability, straining both net profit and revenue of major players. However, signs of recovery have emerged in recent quarters, with expectations of a resurgence in demand in the latter half of the current fiscal, coinciding with the sowing of Rabi crop. In this backdrop, the fertilizer industry is relying on hopes of the government's support to stage a strong rebound later this fiscal.

"Analysts bullish on RIL after earnings meet estimates; brokerages expect growth in Jio, rebound in energy",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/analysts-bullish-on-ril-after-earnings-meet-estimates-brokerages-expect-growth-in-jio-rebound-in-energy-12774375.html,Market,"July 22, 2024 11:44 AM","Reliance Industries Ltd stock has received bullish calls from brokerages, buoyed by strong growth prospects of its telecom unit and a likely rebound in the energy business, following the company’s fiscal first-quarter earnings. Nomura has a ‘buy’ call on Reliance Industries stock, with a price target of Rs 3,600, implying about a 16 percent upside from the last closing price. Nomura analysts said Reliance’s O2C (oil-to-chemicals) business “delivered well in a challenging environment”. They also said that the operational trends remain strong for Reliance Industries, citing the rise of 20 basis points in overall margins year-on-year. On July 19, Reliance Industries reported an 11.5 per cent increase in revenue to Rs 2.58 lakh crore in the first quarter of the current fiscal from a year ago, bolstered by contributions across segments. Consolidated EBITDA rose 2 percent from the year-ago period to Rs 42,748 crore. However, the O2C business EBITDA declined. Also read: Nifty's overvaluation signals imminent correction, says Emkay Even so, Reliance’s O2C business results were in line with the expectations, according to Jefferies. Further, Reliance Industries said that strong contributions from consumer and upstream businesses offset the weak O2C operating environment. Among consumer businesses, Reliance’s Jio results too met expectations, Jefferies added. “Jio should see strong growth on the back of the tariff hike,” it said. Jio Platforms’ revenue from operations rose 12.8 percent from a year earlier to Rs 29,449 crore in the quarter ended June 30. The segment’s EBITDA increased to Rs 14,638 crore. The company said the average revenue per user (ARPU) was Rs 181.7, with a better subscriber mix. Jefferies and Morgan Stanley too have ‘buy’ and ‘overweight’ calls on RIL shares, with price targets of Rs 3,525 and Rs 3,540, respectively. The energy and telecom segments should see a rebound in coming quarters, Morgan Stanley said. Reliance’s retail business revenue grew by 6.6 percent, and EBITDA rose to Rs 5,664 crore. “The management is rationalising unprofitable parts in retail with a focus on margins,” Jefferies said. Reliance’s pivot in retail to focus on margin amid weak domestic demand stands out, Morgan Stanley said. Macquarie has a ‘neutral’ call on Reliance Industries stock, with a target price of Rs 2,750 per share. The company’s follow-through on capex discipline and free cash flow improvement would be positive. RIL’s capital expenditure for the quarter stood at Rs 28,785 crore, comfortably covered by a cash profit of Rs 33,757 crore. Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

Domestic brokerage Emkay Global initiated a ""key avoids"" list as it takes a cautious stance towards the stretched valuations. As Nifty valuations are stretched and a positive budget is priced in, the lack of favourable triggers will lead to a sell-off, said Emkay. Additionally, a tepid Q1FY25 earnings season combined with rate cuts coming only at end-CY24 will further add to the bearish sentiment, said the brokerage. The valuations of the frontline stocks have become frothy, with Nifty around 10 percent over the five-year historic mean at 21.4x 1YF PER. Valuations for the NSE Midcap 150 (42x trailing) and NSE Smallcap 250 (31x trailing) are also 52.5 percent and 35.5 percent above their respective 5Y averages. ""Even accounting for the strong growth outlook, we see these valuations having some front-ended future returns and setting up the market for a one-time correction. Only meaningful upgrades in forward estimates could support such elevated multiples, and we do not see that in the next 1-2 quarters,"" said Emkay. Follow our market blog to catch all the updates The likely correction will be led by Industrials, as a result of their high valuations and Financials, which are the most liquid. Durables, especially Autos, are also vulnerable, said the brokerage. According to Emkay, the best sectors to ""hide"" in are Staples, Energy, and Technology, in that order. Emkay initiated a ""key avoids"" list. The brokerage's underweight stance on financials is reflected through HDFC Bank and SBI Cards, as it sees a derating in both stocks even as the market adjusts to a new growth/ROE reality. It added Eicher to the ""key avoids"" list, given its product positioning and valuations. The technology major, L&T Technology Services, is at an unwarranted premium to large-cap IT services names, especially with a looming weak FY25. PI Industries is the fifth stock that Emkay added to the list, believing that its sub-5 percent EPS for FY25/FY26 is not yet reflected in the valuations. Despite the likelihood of a sell-off, the brokerage remained constructive on India from a longer-term (over a year) and will use a meaningful correction to increase exposure to the market.

Despite this, brokerages offered mixed opinions on the stock, citing uncertainty over the timeline for lifting the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) digital banking ban, keeping margin and loan growth outlook in check. The positives Morgan Stanley analysts issued an 'overweight' call for Kotak Mahindra Bank and increased the target price to Rs 2,300 per share from Rs 2,150, indicating a 30 percent upside from current levels. ""We observed significant one-time gains during the quarter with strong loan growth and controlled costs as key positives.

Motilal Oswal analysts reiterated a 'neutral' rating for the stock and set a target price of Rs 1,800, noting the healthy performance despite the RBI ban on its digital sourcing and restriction on new card issuance. They emphasised that the removal of the ban is critical for the bank to achieve sustainable growth and earnings. Jefferies also assigned a 'hold' rating to Kotak Bank and raised the target price to Rs 1,960 per share from Rs 1,790, attributing this to strong performance in the capital market segments of its subsidiaries.

While robust corporate growth boosted overall loan growth, it came at the expense of margins,"" the brokerage firm commented. JM Financial also issued a 'hold' rating and a target price of Rs 1,830. Analysts noted that key factors to monitor will be the trajectory of deposit growth, the sustenance of margins, and the ability to manage credit costs. ""Although the stock has largely recovered from the losses due to the RBI embargo, core momentum remains soft (lower NIMs and higher credit costs), making further valuation re-rating unlikely.

One 97 Communications, which runs Paytm, reported that its net loss widened two-and half times on-year to Rs 839 crore. The Vijay Shekhar Sharma-led fintech firm's revenue from operations declined 36 percent on-year to Rs 1,502 crore in Q1FY25 as the company continues to cope with the impact of RBI curbs shutting the payments bank business. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had placed crippling restrictions on the firm’s associated entity Paytm Payments Bank Limited (PPBL) in January this year. Previously, Paytm had written off Rs 227.1 crore worth of investment in PPBL and accounted for it as impairment losses. According to Emkay Global, a meaningful revival in Paytm's lending business seems a far call, given continued partner/regulatory concerns, which coupled with disrupted low MDR UPI payment business would keep revenue growth in check. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action Of the Rs 1,502 crore revenue reported in Q1, the payments business contributed Rs 900 crore, Rs 280 crore came from financial services while the rest was contributed from marketing services. Paytm intends to add more lending partners (including banks), but believes that PL business run-rate would remain at similar levels, unless asset quality concerns ease. The company is running pilots for the secured business, but is unlikely to gain scale in the near term, noted Emkay. ""Thus, we believe that slower disbursements, coupled with declining take rates (3-3.5 percent) as it switches to the distribution-only business model, could disrupt its strategy of monetizing the payment business, and could also hurt EBITDA margin,"" the brokerage said. At 9:36 am, Paytm shares were trading over 2 percent lower at Rs 449 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). While the stock has fallen 40 percent so far this year, it gained around 10 percent in the last one month. According to analysts at Emkay, the recent up-move in Paytm stock price was mainly due to rising hope around swift full-business revival, which still looks distant. ""We believe that the long-pending FIPB approval for investment in its payment subsidiary, expected in near term, which is likely to pave the way for an a/c aggregator license, could be sentimentally positive,"" they said.

CLSA finds markets vulnerable going into Budget as expectations rise,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/market-extremely-vulnerable-union-budget-clsa-12774183.html,Market,"July 22, 2024 09:35 AM","Despite the bullish sentiment on Dalal Street leading up to the Union Budget, CLSA's 'Modi stocks' - poised to benefit from a favourable policy environment - have not experienced similar gains and have in fact stayed flat since the election verdict on June 4. The foreign brokerage's 'India Bull Bear Index' currently shows investors' sentiment at 92 percent bullishness, its highest ahead of any Union Budget in the past 15 years. According to CLSA, such an extreme sentiment reading coupled with stretched valuations make the domestic market setup extremely vulnerable going into the budget. Follow our live blog to catch all the updates After a significant 54 percent rally in the eight months leading up to the election results, Modi Stocks have stay remained flat, in stark contrast to other spaces which have risen by up to 12 percent. This stagnation is largely attributed to fears that elevated expectations from the budget are causing widespread disappointment across a large part of the market, the brokerage noted. Ahead of the election verdict on June 4, CLSA identified 54 companies that would have been direct beneficiaries of government's policies, with public sector undertakings (PSUs) making up half of these beneficiaries. These firms are from capex and infrastructure-linked sectors, PSUs or stocks of some corporate houses. The brokerage has named these as “Modi stocks,” since they were rallying based on prospects of the BJP coming back to power. Following the election results, when the BJP failed to cinch a clear majority by itself in the Lok Sabha, CLSA maintained only two of those stocks in its India focus portfolio: ONGC and Reliance Industries.

"Citi, Nuvama up UltraTech's target prices after Q1 earnings; stock gains 2%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/ultratech-cement-citi-nuvama-raise-target-bullish-12774181.html,Market,"July 22, 2024 09:24 AM","UltraTech Cement stock gained over 2 percent as the stock got a thumbs up from brokerages with bullish calls and raised target prices after the first quarter (Q1FY25) earnings. The cement maker's net profit rose marginally to Rs 1,695 crore and revenue grew 2 percent on-year to Rs 18,069, missing street estimates. However, the EBITDA exceeded estimates, driven by higher volumes and RMC sales. UltraTech's guidance on cost reduction and progress in completing capex have given confidence of further upside in the stock. Citi has issued a Buy call on UltraTech Cement, raising the target to Rs 13,000 per share. The optimistic outlook is based on higher volumes, lower costs, and increased sales of ready-mix concrete (RMC). According to analysts at Citi, the key highlights from management commentary during the post-earnings call is the expectation that costs will decrease by over Rs 300 per tonne over the next three years, an improvement over the previously guided Rs 200-300 per tonne figure. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action UltraTech's first quarter was impacted by higher marketing expenditure related to the T20 cricket World Cup. Additionally, July prices were approximately 1.5 percent lower than the first-quarter average, with any potential price hikes likely to occur only after the monsoon season. The company anticipates industry growth of 7-8 percent for FY25, with its own growth expected to be in the double digits. Emkay Global also maintained a 'Buy' rating, adding that India's largest cement manufacturer is on track to achieve 200 mt grey cement capacity by FY27E (~11 percent CAGR) at a capex of less than $75/tonne. This will help the company to achieve industry-leading volume growth, despite its large scale and the lower capex/tonne will boost return ratios, it said.

Given its strong growth/capex plans, pan-India presence, and robust balance sheet, analysts at Emkay revised their June-25E target price upwards to Rs 12,800 per share after the quarterly rollover. While the brokerage is upbeat on UltraTech's industry-leading volume growth during the April-June quarter, the rising net debt was a concern, it said. Meanwhile, factoring in the capex aimed to help UltraTech outperform industry growth, Nuvama increased the target EV/EBITDA to 18x (from 17x).

Safe-haven gold firms as Joe Biden move sparks market uncertainty,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gold-edges-higher-on-softer-dollar-fed-rate-cut-bets-12774205.html,Market,"July 22, 2024 11:07 AM","Gold prices firmed on Monday as the dollar eased following U.S. President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race, with investors turning to bullion as a hedge against an uncertain political and market outlook. Spot gold rose 0.2% at $2,405.40 per ounce, as of 0510 GMT, while U.S. gold futures gained 0.3% to $2,407.20. The prospect of rate cuts and political uncertainty in the United States are supporting gold prices, and conditions are in place for gold to see another record high before the end of 2024, said Kyle Rodda, a financial market analyst at Capital.com. Making bullion more attractive to buyers holding other currencies, the dollar eased in the initial reaction to U.S. President Joe Biden abandoning his reelection bid, clearing the way for another Democrat to challenge Donald Trump. When accepting the Republican nomination on Thursday, Trump reiterated his promise to cut corporate taxes and interest rates. Analysts also expect a Trump presidency would make for tougher trade relations, which could result in inflationary tariffs. ""I think there is an almost unstoppable process of decoupling between the U.S. and China, it will only become more severe or accelerate if it is a Trump presidency. Gold will certainly benefit from greater geopolitical tensions,"" Rodda said. Prices scaled an all-time high of $2,483.60 last week on increased chances of U.S. interest rate cuts this year, with markets pricing in a 97% chance of a cut in September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. On the data front, the main focus this week will be on Friday's U.S. personal consumption expenditures (PCE) figure and other data including July S&P Global flash PMIs, advance second-quarter GDP, and weekly jobless claims. Among other metals, spot silver fell 0.5% to $29.11 per ounce, platinum slipped 0.3% to $959.99, while palladium rose 1.1% to $916.18.

Moneycontrol Pro Market Outlook | Markets approach the budget week with caution,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/moneycontrol-pro-market-outlook-markets-approach-the-budget-week-with-caution-12774008.html,Market,"July 22, 2024 08:47 AM","Dear Reader, An eventful week leading to the annual budget presentation saw profit booking in the broader market while the benchmark indices closed flat. The week started with a failed assassination attempt on former U.S. President Donald Trump, followed by a global outage of Microsoft services, causing widespread disruptions. These disturbances significantly impacted global markets more than the Indian market. The MSCI World Index fell by 2.03 percent, the S&P 500 recorded its worst weekly drop since April, losing 1.97 percent, and the Nasdaq declined by 3.65 percent. European markets also experienced selling pressure, with the Stoxx 600 falling by 2.46 percent and the German DAX leading the decline with a 3.07 percent loss. In comparison, Indian benchmark indices held their ground, closing flat for the week after reaching new highs, although broader indices faced selling pressure. As we move into budget week, traders are generally expected to keep their positions light. The volatility index has also crept up, closing at its highest level in a month. Short-term Pressure Likely  Nifty closed up for the seventh consecutive week, though we saw some selling in the broad market at the end of the week. A correction ahead of the budget does open us up to negative surprises. But if markets fall ahead of the event, it can also result in a post-event rally. Sentiment data can help us navigate the near-term move into the event, as we have an interesting set up in the short term. The short-term sentiment, as measured by the swing, is showing an oversold condition (see chart Daily Swing) that is developing. The swing fell to the oversold zone at 14. If it falls further to single digits, it would be extremely oversold. All we need to do is wait for the downward momentum of the last two days to reverse. Then, it should be back to the highs.  Daily Swing Source: web.strike.money The FII positioning is the only concern. The long futures position by FIIs in the number of contract terms is at a new seven-year high (see chart FII Futures Position), and that does put you on tenterhooks. However, this data can remain elevated until the stock market confirms a trend reversal. At this stage, it's only a warning.  FII Futures Position Source: web.strike.money The 20-day Advance/Decline (A/D) ratio (see chart Advance Decline ratio) has fallen significantly, relieving us of the overbought reading because of the correction in midcaps and small caps. So, even as the Nifty is down a bit from the recent highs, stocks have already seen a correction. The Nifty Midcap 100 is close to the 40dema and might find support there on Monday.  Advance Decline ratio Source: web.strike.money Sector Rotation Last week was largely negative for the markets, with only a few sectoral indices, such as IT, FMCG, and PSU Banks, managing to close positive for the week. On the weekly timeframe RRG (see chart Weekly RRG), almost all the sectors are losing either relative strength or relative momentum, if not both. Only the Nifty IT Index has shown a positive tick in both parameters and maintains its position in the improving quadrant.  Weekly RRG Source: web.strike.money Regarding the Daily timeframe RRG (see chart Daily RRG), the Nifty FMCG Index has been the pick for the week. With a steady rise in both relative strength and relative momentum, it has made its way back to the leading quadrant. The PSU Bank Index has entered the improving quadrant, but it still needs to catch up on relative strength. PSE, Oil & Gas, IT, Pharma, Healthcare, and Energy remain in the leading quadrant, but their relative momentum was flat to negative. The rest of the sectors, namely Metals, Realty, Media, Consumer Durables, Private Banks, and Financial Services, are all in lagging territory and posted a decline in relative strength.  Daily RRG Source: web.strike.money Indices and Market Breadth A sharp fall on Friday saw the benchmark indices retrace the gains made during the week. Both BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 closed the week flat with a gain of 0.10 percent. The broader indices, however, saw selling pressure, resulting in the Midcap index losing 2.60 percent and the small-cap index stocks shedding 2.36 percent. As in the derivative market, FIIs continue to add to their positions. During the week, FIIs bought Rs 10,945.98 crore of shares, bringing their total buying for the month to Rs 21,664.63 crore. The top gainers among stocks in the derivative segment were India Cements, which closed 16.52 percent higher, Mphasis, which was up 6.80 percent, and SBI Life, which ended 5.43 percent higher. Among the losers during the week were HAL, which closed 12.55 percent lower, Siemens, down 10.03 percent, and Cummins, down 9.98 percent. Stocks to Watch Among the stocks expected to perform better during the week are ICICI Bank, Hindustan Unilever, Glenmark, SBI Life, Colgate Palmolive, ICICI GI, Lal Path Lab, India Cements, Muthoot Finance, SBI and Eicher Motors.

"World Street | Biden exits US presidential race, Asian stocks falter, China cuts short-term rate, and more",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/world-street-biden-exits-us-presidential-race-asian-stocks-falter-china-cuts-short-term-rate-and-more-12774144.html,Market,"July 22, 2024 08:03 AM","Skimming through top global news, World Street's July 22 edition highlights several major stories. Among them, US President Joe Biden has dropped out of the 2024 presidential race, which has led to a negative reaction in Asian stock markets. Additionally, China has unveiled a long-term strategy to reduce the debts of local governments. For more detailed analysis and insights, take a deep dive into the full edition. Biden drops presidential bid; Asian stocks falter President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race, endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party’s nominee. This decision came after weeks of increasing pressure from within his party to step aside in his re-election bid against former President Donald Trump. Following this, asia-Pacific markets fell this morning, with Japan's Nikkei 225, South Korea's Kospi, and Australia's S&P 200 slipping up to 0.5 percent on July 22. US bond yields on the rise US Treasury yields increased July 19 as investors evaluated the future trajectory of interest rates following recent statements from Federal Reserve officials. The yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed approximately 5 basis points to 4.24 percent, while the 2-year Treasury yield rose over 4 basis points to 4.51 percent. Xi Jinping's debt-reduction strategy President Xi Jinping revealed comprehensive plans to strengthen the finances of China’s indebted local governments, as the ruling Communist Party presented its long-term strategy for the world's second-largest economy. In a nearly 22,200-character resolution published by the official Xinhua News Agency on Sunday, China’s top leader outlined measures to address the debt crisis affecting regional authorities. China cuts short-term policy rate China reduced its benchmark lending rates during a monthly fixing on July 22, following a surprise move by the central bank to lower a key short-term policy rate earlier in the session. The one-year loan prime rate (LPR) was decreased by 10 basis points, from 3.45 percent to 3.35 percent, while the five-year LPR was also lowered by 10 basis points, from 3.95 percent to 3.85 percent. Xpeng-Volkswagen AG forge pact Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker Xpeng, in partnership with German automaker Volkswagen AG, has established project houses for engineers to expedite the development of new EV architecture. These new facilities, located in Guangzhou and Hefei, will serve as collaborative spaces for engineers from both companies to work together. Calming South China Sea tremors  More than a month after the China Coast Guard attacked Filipino soldiers during a resupply mission to Ayungin Shoal in mid-June 2024, Manila announced on Sunday (July 21) that it had ""reached an understanding on the provisional arrangement"" with China regarding these missions. ""The Philippines and the People’s Republic of China have reached an understanding on the provisional arrangement for the resupply of daily necessities and rotation missions to the BRP Sierra Madre in Ayungin Shoal,"" stated the announcement. Anger on Bangladesh Streets At least 130 people have been killed in student protests in Bangladesh against quotas for government jobs. In a new development, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court overturned a High Court order that had triggered the crisis. The revised allocation reserves 93 percent of government service positions for merit, while 5 percent are reserved for freedom fighters and their descendants. Additionally, 1 percent of jobs are allocated to tribes, differently abled people, and sexual minorities. (with inputs from Reuters and other agencies) ",NEGATIVE

"Brokerages mixed on HDFC Bank Q1 amid rising slippages, tepid loan growth outlook",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hdfc-share-price-targets-raised-goldman-sachs-jefferies-say-buy-after-q1-results-beat-street-12774140.html,Market,"July 22, 2024 09:17 AM","Shares of HDFC Bank gained over a percent to Rs 1,624 per share on July 22 after the lender's Q1 FY25 earnings surpassed estimates. Despite this, brokerages hold mixed views on the stock due to concerns over sluggish loan growth and a deteriorating asset quality outlook. So far this year, the stock of this private sector lender has declined over 5 percent, underperforming the benchmark Nifty 50 index, which rose 12 percent during the same period. What surprised Street? Goldman Sachs and Jefferies were among the brokerages that raised HDFC Bank share price target, maintaining 'buy' ratings on the stock. The brokerages' analysts cited improving earnings visibility and expansion in margins. Goldman Sachs raised the target price on HDFC Bank stock to Rs 1,927, implying an upside of 20 percent over the last closing price. Jefferies marginally hiked its target price to Rs 1,890. While Jefferies flagged the rise in slippages due to agricultural seasonality, Goldman Sachs maintained that the slippage ratio was better than expected. HDFC Bank's gross non-performing assets (NPA) rose 6 percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 33,026 crore in Q1, whereas gross NPA ratio expanded 9 basis points sequentially to 1.33 percent. India's largest private sector bank reported over the weekend that its April-June net profit fell 2 percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 16,175, while the Net Interest Income rose 2.6 percent sequentially to Rs 29,837 crore. A Moneycontrol poll of brokerages had pegged the fiscal first quarter net profit at Rs 15,905 crore, and NII at Rs 29,621 crore. The negatives Cautioning about muted loan growth outlook, analysts at JPMorgan downgraded HDFC Bank stock to 'neutral' and cut target price to Rs 1,700 per share from Rs 1,800. Nomura, too, maintained a 'neutral' call on the private lender and set Rs 1,750 target price. JPMorgan's downgrade came on the back of slowing down of balance sheet faster than expected. They believe that the bank's growth will remain slow relative to peers over the next 2 years. ""The focus is now on improving CASA and loan mix rather than loans or average balance sheet growth. We expect the bank to run on low incremental loan deposit ratios (LDRs) over FY25-26,"" the brokerage firm cautioned. Similarly, Nomura forecasted muted loan growth for HDFC Bank in the medium-term as the bank makes effort to bring down LDR ratio. ""We estimate compound annual growth rate of 12 percent and 17 percent for loan and deposit, respectively, over FY24-27, which would lower LDR to 92 percent in FY27,"" they said. Moreover, analysts also suggested investors to watch out impact of higher priority sector (PSL) lending requirements from the second quarter onwards. PSL implores banks to dedicate funds for specific sectors of the economy which may not otherwise receive timely and adequate credit like agriculture or allied activities, education, or housing. Operationally, gross advances grew 52.6 percent on-year to Rs 24.86 lakh crore in Q1FY25 while total deposits grew by 24.4 percent YoY to Rs 23.7 lakh crore.

"Sovereign wealth funds are turning bullish on emerging markets, Invesco survey shows",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sovereign-wealth-funds-are-turning-bullish-on-emerging-markets-invesco-survey-shows-12774151.html,Market,"July 22, 2024 07:35 AM","Sovereign wealth funds and central banks that oversee $22 trillion in assets expect emerging-market assets to benefit from rising geopolitical tensions, an annual survey by Invesco Asset Management shows. Two thirds of the respondents expect emerging-market returns to match or beat those from developed markets over the next three years, with non-western SWFs more keen on the relative outperformance of developing assets, according to the survey conducted among 83 sovereign wealth funds and 57 central banks during the first quarter of 2024. The idea is that tensions between the US and China favor developing countries and will boost their economies as companies shift supply chains across locations and suppliers amid concerns over rising trade barriers between the world’s two largest economies. Investors aren’t treating developing markets as a homogeneous bloc, with emerging Asian countries, excluding China, becoming a favorite. India in particular has become the top play thanks to its large domestic market and growing middle class, with 88% of respondents expressing interest in increasing exposure to the country’s debt, up from 66% in 2022. Indonesia is also getting more interest with 47% looking to increase exposure to its debt, up from 27% in 2022, while China saw a decline to 35% from 71%, according to Invesco. Over half of the survey’s participants invest in emerging-market debt, with more than two thirds of these holding both local and hard currency bonds, often through ETFs. Dollar-denominated government and corporate bonds from emerging issuers gained 3.4% this year, compared with a 1.3% loss on global aggregate debt and a 2.8% loss on US Treasuries, Bloomberg indexes show. The survey also showed rising popularity of private credit among sovereign investors, with two-thirds of them planning to increase their allocation in the coming year. The interest can be attributed to factors such as the sector’s “strong performance” and its use as a diversification strategy compared with fixed-income. Overall, fixed-income allocations remained steady at 28% while equity allocations increased to 32% this year from 30% a year ago, the survey showed. The optimism about steady or accelerating global growth over the next 18 months, and confidence in the US economy, is tempered by a range of risks including geopolitical tensions and sticky inflation.

Indian rupee may test record low; budget in spotlight,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/indian-rupee-may-test-record-low-budget-in-spotlight-12774145.html,Market,"July 22, 2024 07:19 AM","The Indian rupee may slip to a record low this week, with traders eyeing cues from the country's federal budget, while the government likely sticking to fiscal discipline could cheer bond traders. The rupee closed at a record closing low of 83.6625 against the U.S. dollar on Friday, with likely intervention by the Reserve Bank of India helping limit losses. The currency was down 0.1% for the week. ""The RBI seems to be exhibiting greater tolerance for rupee weakness in order to correct the overvaluation,"" forex advisory firm IFA Global said in a note. Broad-based dollar demand, including from oil and defence companies, has pressured the rupee in recent trading sessions, traders said. ""Even minor 2-3 paisa dips (on USD/INR) are quickly bought, so overall bias remains to the upside,"" a foreign exchange trader at a large private bank said. The trader added that while the rupee is likely to stay under pressure, outsized moves will be capped by the RBI. India's federal budget announcement is due on Tuesday, with investors closely watching for any revisions to the country's fiscal deficit target and government's gross market borrowing for the financial year ending March 2025. U.S. GDP and personal consumption expenditures data, due later in the week, will also be in focus for cues on the U.S. policy rates. Investors currently expect the Federal Reserve to begin cutting rates in September. Meanwhile, the Indian 10-year government bond yield ended at 6.9641% on Friday, down 2 basis points last week after staying flat in the previous week. Traders expect the benchmark yield to move in the 6.90%-7.05% range this week, depending on the budget announcements. Bond yields may see an upward move at open later, as the central bank net sold bonds worth 34 billion rupees ($406.10 million) in the week ended July 12, according to data released after market hours on July 19. This was first such sale after a gap of more than eight months. Bond yields have barely budged over the last two weeks amid a lack of stronger triggers to break on either side of current levels, and have been unaffected by other factors. A Reuters poll shows median forecasts for the fiscal deficit target at 5.1% of gross domestic product and the gross borrowing at 14.13 trillion rupees, the same as February's interim budget. Still, some market participants are not ruling out a cut in borrowing after a record surplus transfer from the central bank earlier in the year. ICICI Securities Primary Dealership estimates a reduction of 500 billion rupees in net and gross borrowing, roughly corresponding to the absolute fall in fiscal deficit between interim and regular budgets. Focus would also remain on foreign inflows as government bond purchases from overseas investors have crossed $1 billion mark after a slow start post inclusion of debt in JPMorgan's emerging market debt index in June.

"Short Call: Smart investors encash some of the paper profits, bear case for defense, Havells, Infosys, L&T Finance in focus",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/short-call-smart-investors-encash-some-of-the-paper-profits-bear-case-for-defense-havells-infosys-lt-finance-in-focus-12774142.html,Market,"July 22, 2024 07:50 AM","Dalal Street bulls appear to be developing cold feet ahead of the Budget. On Friday, benchmark indices fell the most in a month-and-a-half. The India volatility index climbed to its highest level in over a month, reflecting anxiety among investors. The popular view is that the Budget may not have any negative surprises in store. But a section of smart investors, sitting on huge paper profits, are taking some money off the table. It may not be a bad idea. Emkay Global strategist Seshadri Sen is of the view that there is a risk of a 5-10 correction in the headline indices, and an even sharper fall in small and midcap stocks. Nifty valuations are already stretched at over 21 times one year forward earnings, a positive budget is now in the price, and there no additional positive catalysts. The question is whether the massive liquidity in the system can continue to act as a cushion against a steep fall. After all, the buy-on-dips strategy has worked like a charm so far. For a change, foreign investors have been net buyers of shares post the election verdict. If the recent trend of a weaker dollar and lower bond yields continues, FPIs are likely to maintain their buying momentum, says VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services. Indefensible Broking firm Nirmal Bang has downgraded its rating on the defense sector to ‘sell’. According to Bang analysts, the exuberance built around strong order books ignores factors like fair value, cyclicality, profitability, and efficiency. The valuations do not account for potential execution hiccups, rising raw material costs, competitive pressures, and challenges in cash flow generation. The smart thing to do is to stay on the sidelines until valuations return to more reasonable levels, say the analysts. Havells (Rs 1,765.85, -5.2%) Reported first quarter earnings. Bull Case: Improving price realisation and reduced costs will boost margins. Overall inventory is lower due to surge in demand. Bear Case: Moderating demand amid price hikes puts the industry in a conundrum of preserving margin vs. affecting consumer demand, said Centrum Broking. L&T Finance (Rs 175.29, -5%) Net profit rose 29 percent on-year rise for the Juen quarter. Bull Case: The management is confident of gaining demand momentum, supported by robust deal wins across sectors. From a long-term perspective, the company is well-placed with multiple long duration contracts with big brand names. Bear Case: The demand environment is uncertain, driven by the potential threat of a recession in the world’s largest economies. Additionally, rising subcontracting costs and cross-currency headwinds may negatively impact the company’s operating margins. Infosys (Rs 1,789.35, +1.8%) Delivered better-than-expected Q1 results. Bull case: Rebound in the sector to disproportionately support growth for the company just like how it suffered more with the industry headwinds, writes Nuvama. Green shoots of recovery hinting at a revival in demand. Bear case: Slower-than-expected recovery in discretionary spends. A depreciation of the Indian rupee against the dollar, pound and euro may also hamper growth. (With inputs from Zoya, Veer, and Vaibhavi)

Brent crude prices were up 48 cents, or 0.57%, at $83.10 a barrel by 0035 GMT, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 42 cents, or 0.52%, to $80.55. ""Since the June FOMC meeting, inflation and labour market data have signalled that disinflation and labour market rebalancing are in place, which we expect will allow the Fed to begin its interest rate cutting cycle in September,"" ANZ Research said in a note. The U.S. Federal Reserve will next hold a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on interest rates on July 30-31, at which investors expect the Fed to keep the rates unchanged, while looking for any signal of a cut coming later in the year. On the political front, U.S. President Joe Biden abandoned his reelection bid on Sunday under pressure from fellow Democrats and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the party's candidate to face Republican Donald Trump in November. Slower-than-expected economic growth of 4.7% for China in the second quarter sparked concerns last week over the country's demand for oil and continues to weigh on prices. On Sunday, China released a policy document outlining known ambitions, from developing advanced industries to improving the business environment, with analysts spotting no sign of imminent structural shifts in the world's second-biggest economy. The 60-point document's publication follows last week's closed-door meeting of the Communist Party's Central Committee that takes place roughly every five years.

Asia stocks wary; Wall Street unfazed as Joe Biden bows out,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/asia-stocks-wary-wall-street-unfazed-as-joe-biden-bows-out-12774127.html,Market,"July 22, 2024 06:23 AM","Asian shares tread cautiously on Monday ahead of a packed week of corporate earnings that should test the sky-high valuations of tech stocks, while investors hope a key reading in U.S. inflation will narrow the odds on a September rate cut. Investors seemed well-prepared for news U.S. President Joe Biden had dropped out of the election race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for the Democratic ticket. Online betting site PredictIT showed pricing for a victory by Donald Trump had fallen 3 cents to 61 cents, while Harris climbed 11 cents to 38 cents. California governor Gavin Newsom, another possible Democratic challenger, trailed at 4 cents. Markets took the news in their stride, with S&P 500 stock futures edging up 0.3%, while Nasdaq futures added 0.5%. Futures for 10-year Treasuries rose 3 ticks, while 10-year bond yields dipped 2 basis points to 4.22%. ""As Trump's polling results have lifted, markets have favoured positions that anticipate more trade barriers and possibly higher inflation,"" ANZ analysts said. ""Some polls have Harris performing better than Biden against Trump, and the Democrats will be hoping the next polls feature a Harris-driven bump."" MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.2%, having shed 3% last week amid a general risk-off mood. Japan's Nikkei lost 0.6%, and South Korea's benchmark index was down 0.4%. U.S. second-quarter earnings are poised to dominate the week, with Tesla and Google-parent Alphabet kicking off the season for the ""Magnificent Seven"" megacap group of stocks. Others reporting include General Electric, General Motors, Ford and Lockheed Martin. The tech sector is projected to increase year-over-year earnings by 17%, while profit for the communication services sector is seen rising about 22%. Such gains would outpace the 11% estimated rise for the S&P 500 overall, according to LSEG IBES. A busy week for economic news will culminate with the Federal Reserve's favoured inflation measure out on Friday. The core personal consumption expenditures index is seen rising 0.1% in June, pulling the annual pace down a tick to 2.5%. Markets are wagering heavily that a benign outcome will underline the case for a September rate cut, which futures are pricing as a 97% chance. Also due are figures for advance gross domestic product that are forecast to show growth picking up to an annualised 1.9% in the second quarter, from 1.4% in the first. The closely-watched Atlanta Fed GDPNow indicator points to growth of 2.7%, suggesting some risk to the upside. The Bank of Canada meets on Wednesday and is considered almost certain to cut its rates by a quarter point to 4.5%. China is expected to leave its one-year and five-year loan prime rates unchanged later on Monday. Beijing released a policy document on Sunday outlining known ambitions, from developing advanced industries to improving the business environment, but showed no sign of imminent structural shifts in the world's second-biggest economy. In currency markets, the dollar gave back a little of last week's safe haven gains as the euro edged up 0.2% to $1.0900. The dollar likewise dipped 0.2% on the Japanese yen to 157.21.

NITES opposes Karnataka's proposed IT work hours extension in letter to labour ministry,https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/nites-opposes-karnatakas-proposed-it-work-hours-extension-in-letter-to-labour-ministry-article-12774053.html,Market,"July 21, 2024 08:00 PM","Pune-based IT industry body Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES) has written to the labour ministry opposing the proposed amendment of extending working hours for IT employees in Karnataka. NITES has also threatened a nationwide strike by turning off computers if the amendment is enacted. The state government is considering amending the Karnataka Shops and Commercial Establishments Act, 1961, which proposes that employees in the IT/ITeS/BPO sector may be required or allowed to work more than 12 hours a day and not exceeding 125 hours in three continuous months. ""We vehemently oppose any such amendment and wish to vehemently express our strongest dissent,"" NITES wrote in the letter to the ministry. Harpreet Singh Saluja, President of NITES, said employees in Bengaluru and elsewhere already spend approximately 3 hours commuting each day. Extending the work hours would have a detrimental effect on employees, he added. “On behalf of IT employees across Karnataka and the entire nation, we urge the government to reconsider any amendment that seeks to extend working hours beyond reasonable limits. On July 20, the Karnataka State IT/ITeS Employees Union (KITU) opposed the proposal to extend the working hours of employees in the IT/ITES/BPO sector. Moneycontrol had reported that a proposal to increase working hours has been on the discussion table for some time, citing a senior labour department official. ""There has been a demand from the IT/ITES/BPO sector to extend the timings, and stakeholder meetings are ongoing, but we haven't decided on it yet."" Also read: 'Totally inhumane': Internet reacts to Karnataka IT firms' 14-hour workday proposal In a statement, KITU general secretary Suhas Adiga said: ""The proposed 'Karnataka Shops and Commercial Establishments (Amendment) Bill 2024' attempts to normalise a 14-hour workday. The existing act allows a maximum of 10 hours of work per day, including overtime, which has been completely lifted in the current amendment. It will enable IT/ITES companies to extend the daily hours of work indefinitely.""

"Stay stock-specific and maintain strict stop-loss strategies in budget week, pick these 3 stock ideas, advises Jigar",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/stay-stock-specific-and-maintain-strict-stop-loss-strategies-in-budget-week-pick-these-3-stock-ideas-advises-jigar-12774025.html,Market,"July 21, 2024 07:55 PM","By Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi It was a historic week (ended July 19) for domestic markets as the benchmark indices reached new milestones, but the bulls lost steam on the last trading session, with a drop of nearly 350 points from the new peak of 24,850, settling in the red. Despite this, the weekly performance was relatively flat, with the Nifty closing with a slight gain of 0.12 percent. Conversely, the BSE Sensex surpassed the 80,000 mark, closing near 80,600, driven mainly by IT stocks, which had been strong performers in recent weeks. Recently we noted that Nifty's breakout above 24,400 suggested a potential rise towards 25,000. However, it only reached 24,850 before profit-booking occurred. Despite this, strong index management continues, previously led by Reliance Industries and now by IT stocks. On the data front, the FIIs' long-short ratio in index futures peaked at 81 percent during the week and is now around 79 percent, which might be a negative indicator for the markets moving forward. In addition, we are witnessing a Bearish Engulfing pattern on the daily scale of Nifty. This indicates that the top of 24,850 would be difficult to conquer. On the other hand, the markets appear resilient, potentially buoyed by expectations for the upcoming 2024 budget. This suggests that there is some indecisiveness at current levels. Traders are advised to stay stock-specific and maintain strict stop-loss strategies. A breach of 24,500 could halt the current momentum and we might witness further profit booking during Monday’s session towards 24,300 – 24,200. The Nifty Bank index was largely sideways to negative, ending with a minor loss of around 0.03 percent. Reversal candlestick patterns are emerging on the weekly scale of Bank Nifty. A close below 51,700 might increase selling pressure, potentially dragging the index down to 51,000 and then 50,000 levels. Conversely, the momentum could resume if the index surpasses 52,800. Here are three buy calls for short term: Bajaj Finserv | CMP: Rs 1,640.25  Since past few days, Bajaj Finserv has been trading in a tight range between Rs 1,565 and Rs 1,610, a phase often seen before a major price shift. It has now broken out of this range with significant trading volume, indicating growing investor interest and confidence. This breakout suggests a potentially good buying opportunity. From a technical standpoint, the daily chart has revealed an Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern with a neckline at Rs 1,620, and the stock is holding steady above this level around Rs 1,640. Moreover, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) has formed a bullish crossover just above the zero line, signalling upward momentum. The combination of the breakout and MACD crossover points to further potential gains. Therefore, considering the technical indicators, initiating long positions in Bajaj Finserv within the Rs 1,620-1,645 range seems prudent. This entry range could lead to a target price of Rs 1,800, offering significant upside potential. To mitigate risk, a stop-loss at Rs 1,550 on a daily closing basis is recommended. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,550 Titan Company | CMP: Rs 3,259  In the past few weeks, Titan has been in a corrective phase after reversing from Bullish BAT pattern on daily chart. Double bottom structure has seen on weekly scale along with massive volume activity at lower levels which is a sign of bullish reversal. Having said that, double bottom structure has seen exactly on previous breakout range which was seen in July 2023. This level, previously a resistance, has now turned into support. Considering these factors, investors might consider buying Titan shares within Rs 3,235-3,265 range, anticipating a potential price increase to a target of Rs 3,575. To manage risk effectively, it is advisable to set a stop-loss order around Rs 3,090 based on daily closing prices, protecting against potential downside movements. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,575 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,090 Aether Industries | CMP: Rs 881.1  Recently, Aether has been in a corrective phase after breaking out from Rs 860 level with significant volume. Notably, the recent correction has occurred with very low volume, suggesting that bearish pressure is weakening near Rs 860-support level. This level, previously a resistance, has now turned into support. Considering these factors, investors might consider buying Aether shares within Rs 860-880 range, anticipating a potential price increase to a target of Rs 970. It is advisable to set a stop-loss order around Rs 820 based on daily closing prices, protecting against potential downside movements. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 970 Stop-Loss: Rs 820 Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"Chartist Talks: Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities advises caution in mid, smallcap segments ahead of budget",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/chartist-talks-sudeep-shah-of-sbi-securities-advises-caution-in-mid-smallcap-segment-ahead-of-budget-12774002.html,Market,"July 21, 2024 06:30 PM","According to Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities, the 24,250-24,200 area will act as strong support for the Nifty 50 as any sustainable move below 24,200 will lead to further profit booking in the index up to 23,900 levels in the short term. After selling pressure last week, Sudeep recommends adopting a cautious stance in mid and small-cap space ahead of budget. Technically, the Nifty IT and Nifty FMCG are in a better position, and both are likely to outperform the frontline indices, said the Deputy Vice-President and Head of the Technical and Derivative Research desk at SBI Securities, who has more than 17 years of experience in technical research. How would you approach the Nifty index ahead of Union Budget? For the seventh consecutive week, the benchmark index Nifty has ended on a positive note. It has marked a fresh all-time high of 24,854 during the week ended July 19. However, on Friday, it failed to sustain at higher levels and witnessed a profit booking of over 250 points. This resulted in the formation of a Bearish Engulfing candlestick pattern on a daily scale. The Bearish Engulfing is a bearish reversal candlestick pattern, which usually occurs at the end of an uptrend. Additionally, on a weekly scale, it has formed a Shooting Star candlestick pattern, which also indicates profit booking at higher levels. Further, the daily RSI has given a bearish crossover after touching the overbought zone. These technical formations indicate limited upside for the short-term. Talking about Nifty levels, the 20-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average) zone of 24,250-24,200 will act as strong support for the index. Any sustainable move below the level of 24,200 will lead to further profit booking in the index up to 23,900 levels in the short term. While, on the upside, the zone of 24,850-24,900 will be the crucial hurdle for the index. We expect the index to trade in the range of 24,200 to 24,850. What is your outlook on Bank Nifty for the coming week, given the consolidation in the week gone by? Over the last nine trading sessions, the banking benchmark index Bank Nifty has been oscillating in a range of 52,818-51,749. During this phase, it has significantly underperformed compared to the frontline indices and has mostly formed indecisive candles. The ratio chart of Bank Nifty, in comparison to Nifty, is at a 39-day low, clearly indicating underperformance. Due to the consolidation, the Bollinger Band has been narrowed considerably on a daily scale. In technical parlance, it is known as Bollinger Band squeeze. It occurs when the volatility falls to low levels and the band narrows. A volatility contraction or narrowing of the bands can foreshadow a significant advance or decline. Hence, we expect a trending move in the index in the next couple of trading sessions. Talking about levels, the zone of 51,900-51,800 will act as strong support for the index. If the index slips below the level of 51,800, then the next support is placed at 51,200 level. While, on the upside, the zone of 52,700-52,800 will be the crucial hurdle for the index. Any sustainable move above the level of 52,800 will lead to resume its northward journey. In that case, it is likely to test the level of 53,400 in the short term. Do you expect the traders to be cautious about the midcap and smallcap space in the coming week? Yes, we recommend adopting a cautious stance ahead of budget in mid and small-cap space. Nifty Midcap marked a high of 57,909 on Wednesday and thereafter witnessed a sharp profit booking of over 3 percent. On a weekly scale, it has formed a sizeable bearish candle. Along with this fall, the index has slipped below its 20-day EMA level for the first time after 29 trading sessions. The daily RSI (Relative Strength Index) and Stochastic have given a bearish crossover, and they both are in falling mode. Going ahead, any sustainable move below the level of 55,500 will lead to further selling pressure in the index. In that case, the next support is placed in the zone of 54,700-54,600 level. While, on the upside, the resistance has shifted lower in the zone of 56,400-56,500 level. Nifty Smallcap 100 index has also witnessed profit booking from all-time high levels. It has also slipped below its 20-day EMA level. The daily RSI has given a bearish crossover, and it is in falling mode. Going ahead, the zone of 18,150-18,100 will be the immediate support for the index. Any sustainable move below the level of 18,100 will lead to further correction in the index up to the level of 17,800 in the short term. Which sectors do you feel one should focus on in the budget week?? Technically, the Nifty IT and Nifty FMCG are in a better position. Hence, we believe these sectors are likely to outperform the frontline indices. On the other hand, Nifty Metal and Nifty Media are looking weak on charts.

"Dalal Street Week Ahead: Union Budget, Q1 Earnings, US GDP among 10 key factors to watch",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/dalal-street-week-ahead-union-budget-q1-earnings-us-gdp-among-10-key-factors-to-watch-12773873.html,Market,"July 21, 2024 12:32 PM","Market participants remain cautious ahead of the key event, the Union Budget 2024, scheduled for next week. The benchmark indices lost about a percent due to Friday's sell-off, ending the week flat with a positive bias. The indices had remained positive since the beginning of the week, buoyed by IT companies' quarterly earnings and buying in FMCG counters amid good monsoon progress. However, caution ahead of the Budget and Microsoft-led disruptions in various industries activated the bears on Friday. In the coming week, the indices will first react to earnings from Reliance Industries, Wipro, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and JSW Steel, announced after market hours on Friday and Saturday. Overall, the market is expected to be range-bound, likely with a positive bias given the renewed buying interest from Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs). Investors will be looking for cues from the Union Budget, the next round of corporate earnings, and US GDP numbers. Some volatility is anticipated, given the monthly expiry of July Futures & Options contracts next week, experts said. The BSE Sensex was up 85 points at 80,605, and the Nifty 50 rose 29 points to 24,531. However, the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices underperformed the benchmarks, falling 2.2 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively, amid profit-taking. ""Investors were cautious last Friday ahead of the Union Budget next week, which will provide the next set of directions to the market. The earnings season will also pick up pace, resulting in stock-specific actions,"" said Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services. Here are 10 key factors to watch next week: Union Budget 2024 All eyes will be on the much-awaited first Union Budget of the NDA government 3.0 scheduled to be presented on July 23. Most experts expect pro-industry budget with the government trying to strike a balance between fiscal deficit, capex for growth, and social spending. Also, the focus will be on jobs creation, Make in India initiative, green energy, boosting in rural and urban areas. In addition, domestic and foreign investors will look for the government's take on long term capital gains tax. ""If the budget meets the expectation, it will provide more stability in the market,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said. Corporate Earnings The street will also focus on ongoing corporate earnings season as nearly 300 companies will release their quarterly results scorecard next week including the key names like Bajaj Finance, Hindustan Unilever, Axis Bank, Bajaj Finserv, Larsen & Toubro, SBI Life Insurance Company, Nestle India, Tech Mahindra, Cipla, IndusInd Bank, Power Grid Corporation of India, Shriram Finance, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, and ICICI Bank. In addition, InterGlobe Aviation, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company, Allied Blenders and Distillers, Coforge, IDBI Bank, Suzlon Energy, ICICI Securities, M&M Financial Services, Torrent Pharma, United Spirits, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, Federal Bank, Indraprastha Gas, Jindal Steel & Power, Ashok Leyland, Canara Bank, DLF, and MCX India will also announce numbers. Domestic Economic Data Apart from budget and earnings, the market will look for cues from the HSBC Manufacturing and Services PMI flash numbers for July, releasing on July 24. The Manufacturing PMI rose to 58.3 in June, from 57.5 in May and Services PMI climbed to 60.5, from 60.2 during the same period. Furthermore, bank loan and deposit growth for the fortnight ended July 12, and foreign exchange reserves for the week ended July 19 will be announced July 26. US GDP On the global front, the market participants will keenly watch the advance estimates of the US GDP growth for the June quarter of 2024. The US economy is expected to grow at better numbers during the said quarter, compared to the 1.4 percent growth reported in the March quarter (Q1-2024). Apart from that, core PCE prices for Q2-2024 and durable goods orders & retail sales for June from the US will also be eyed. All these numbers will be critical for the Fed's policy decision. Global Economic Data The Manufacturing and Services PMI flash numbers for July from economies like US, Europe and Japan, too, will be watched.  FII Flow Furthermore, the participants will also watch the activity at the FIIs desk as foreign institutional buyers remained consistent buyers in Indian equities for another week (ended July 19), picking Rs 10,946 crore worth of shares, taking total monthly net buying to Rs 21,664 crore in the cash segment and supporting overall market sentiment. The data indicated that they were buyers in technology, telecom, oil & gas, auto, healthcare and capital goods sectors, although there was a lack of buying in financial services. On the other side, domestic institutional investors have taken advantage of profit booking, selling Rs 4,226 crore worth of shares during the week which reduced their net buying for July to just Rs 779 crore. IPO On the primary market front, the major action will be seen in the SME segment as total eight IPOs will hit Dalal Street next week with SAR Televenture, and RNFI Services public issues opening on July 22, and VL Infraprojects, and VVIP Infratech on July 23. Further, Manglam Infra and Engineering, and Chetana Education will open their initial public offerings on July 24, while the IPOs of Clinitech Laboratory, and Aprameya Engineering will be launched on July 25. Seven companies - Three M Paper Boards, Prizor Viztech, Sati Poly Plast, Aelea Commodities, Tunwal E-Motors, Macobs Technologies, and Kataria Industries from the SME segment will also list on the bourses in the coming week. In the mainboard segment, Sansar will close its public issue on July 23 and make its debut on the bourse on July 26. Technical View Technically, the 24,500 is expected to be crucial next week as the benchmark Nifty 50 formed bearish reversal patterns (Bearish Engulfing and Shooting Star) at the top on the daily and weekly charts, indicating caution at Dalal Street. If the index decisively breaks the said level, 24,000 is the major support for the Nifty 50 at lower level, whereas on the higher side, 24,850 is the hurdle as above the same, 25,000 is the target to watch, according to experts who ruled out severe selling pressure. F&O Cues & India VIX The monthly options data indicated that the index may see immediate resistance at 24,700 and crucial at 25,000 mark, however, 23,500 is the immediate support, and 24,000 is the key support area. On the Call side, the maximum open interest was seen at the 25,500 strike, followed by the 26,000 and 25,000 strikes, with maximum writing at the 26,000 strike, and then the 25,000 and 24,700 strikes, while on the Put side, 23,500 strike holds the maximum open interest, followed by the 24,000 and 23,000 strikes, with maximum writing at the 23,300 strike, and then the 24,500 and 23,800 strikes. Meanwhile, the volatility increased significantly for another week as the market approaches Budget event. Experts expect it to be elevated and likely to cool down post the said event. India VIX, the fear index, jumped 8 percent for second consecutive week, to 14.83.

About 1,984 shares declined against 353 rising shares on the NSE. Experts see a sharp correction if the index decisively closes below 24,500, with 24,000 acting as a crucial support and 24,900 as a hurdle on the higher side. Here are some trading ideas for the near term: Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities ITC | CMP: Rs 474.55  On the weekly time frame, ITC confirmed a ""downsloping trendline"" breakout at the Rs 462 level, indicating a trend reversal. On the weekly chart, the stock has confirmed higher tops and bottoms formations, indicating a strong comeback of bulls. The stock is placed above its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day SMA (Simple Moving Average), and these averages are also inching up along with the price rise, reaffirming the bullish trend. The daily, weekly, and monthly strength indicator RSI (Relative Strength Index) is in positive terrain, which justifies rising strength across all the time frames. Investors should buy, hold, and accumulate this stock with an expected upside of Rs 500-530, with a downside support zone of Rs 458-445 levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 500, Rs 530 Stop-Loss: Rs 445 Orient Cement | CMP: Rs 325.55 Orient Cement is in a strong uptrend across all time frames, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms indicating a positive bias. It has also confirmed a ""Pennant"" continuation pattern, indicating bullish sentiments. Huge rising volumes at breakout zones signify increased participation. The stock is placed above its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day SMA, and these averages are also inching up along with the price rise, reaffirming the bullish trend. The daily, weekly, and monthly strength indicator RSI is in positive terrain, justifying rising strength across all time frames. Investors should buy, hold, and accumulate this stock with an expected upside of Rs 355-375, with a downside support zone of Rs 303-293 levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 355, Rs 375 Stop-Loss: Rs 293 SBI Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 1,647.7  SBI Life is in a strong uptrend, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms.

Investors should buy, hold, and accumulate this stock with an expected upside of Rs 1,730-1,800, with a downside support zone of Rs 1,600-1,565 levels Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,730, Rs 1,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,565 Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst - Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One Avenue Supermarts | CMP: Rs 5,010.7  DMart witnessed a substantial increase in price in the last couple of trading sessions from the 21 DEMA (Exponential Moving Average) on the daily chart. Additionally, the counter witnessed an ‘ascending triangle’ breakout, construing a positive development. From a technical standpoint, the counter has gained significant traction in terms of volumes lately, which is likely to augur well from a short to medium-term outlook. On the oscillator front, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) signals a continuation move, suggesting a potential upside journey in a comparable period. Hence, we recommend buying DMart around Rs 5,000-4,960. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 5,350, Rs 5,400 Stop-Loss: Rs 4,790 Hindustan Unilever | CMP: Rs 2,727  Hindustan Unilever witnessed a decisive multi-week breakout in the last trading week, soaring nearly 4 percent. The counter has witnessed very strong traction in the last couple of trading weeks and seems poised to continue its northward move in the comparable period. Additionally, the recent gains have been backed by a notable increase in trading volumes, adding a bullish quotient to its undertone. On the oscillator front, MACD signals a continuation move, suggesting a potential upside journey for the counter. Hence, we recommend buying Hindustan Unilever on dips of Rs 2,700-2,680. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,950, Rs 3,000 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,550 Life Insurance Corporation of India | CMP: Rs 1,108.25  LIC witnessed a substantial increase in price in the last couple of trading sessions to breach its previous swing high on the daily chart. Additionally, the counter witnessed strong traction in terms of trading volumes and has also witnessed a range breakout on the weekly time frame chart. On the oscillator front, most of the indicators are strongly aligned with the momentum, adding a bullish quotient and suggesting a potential upside journey in a comparable period. Hence, we recommend buying LIC around Rs 1,100-1,080. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,280 Stop-Loss: Rs 988 Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi Aether Industries | CMP: Rs 881.1  Recently, Aether has been in a corrective phase after breaking out from Rs 860 level with significant volume. Notably, the recent correction has occurred with very low volume, suggesting that bearish pressure is weakening near the Rs 860 support level. This level, previously a resistance, has now turned into support. Considering these factors, investors might consider buying Aether shares within the Rs 860-880 range, anticipating a potential price increase to a target of Rs 970. To manage risk effectively, it is advisable to set a stop-loss order around Rs 820 based on daily closing prices, protecting against potential downside movements. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 970 Stop-Loss: Rs 820 Vinay Rajani, Senior Technical/Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities Tata Power July Futures | CMP: Rs 413.90  Tata Power has broken down from the last four weeks’ narrow consolidation.

Stockology: Technology and FMCG are taking over from the PSU rally,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/stockology-technology-and-fmcg-are-taking-over-from-the-psu-rally-12773708.html,Market,"July 21, 2024 11:22 AM","Stockology is a weekly column by futurologist Mahesh Gowande. He is the Founder and Director of Ayan Analytics, which has developed ZodiacAnalyst, a research software with time and price charting tools. Read previous columns here ReviewThe Nifty is near a major resistance point and we have just started seeing the first signs of that. Except for Thursday, our date-wise expectations for the past week went haywire. It is clearly visible that technology and FMCG are taking over from the PSU rally. The selling was directional and broad-based — it was more of bulls unloading, and participation of short sellers was limited. Technical Two long candles on the daily charts makes a short term reversal extremely obvious. Going forward, volatility would rise significantly. As of now, 24,450 and 24,290 look like  buy zones, with the nearby stop of 24,140. Per the technical indicators, as prices keep rising, the exit stops will also move along with the rise, and rightly so. From a short term perspective, exit stops are very close now, at 24,140. Generally, after a drop there is  a pullback rally, but in case the pullback fails to retrace 70 percent of the current high, then it's a clear sign that the markets will fall further. In that case, liquidating positions is recommended. If the recovery or pullback is below 50 percent, then it is a sign that aggressive short selling can be initiated. Long term investors can hold back fresh investments for now. Time map While the time is slightly favouring the bullish camp, slowly and steadily other factors are turning negative, and the day time turns negative, the impact would be huge. As of now, the markets are showing positivity in the coming week, even though  it looks like they will be volatile. Traders and speculators would be able to make money, but volatility will cause most small and midcap stocks to enter a long sideways, declining phase, which will hurt investors. It is time to be very careful about  investments, and detailed attention should be given to portfolios, where protective strategies will give better results. SUN 120 NEPTUNE shows that a big plan will get executed, SUN 180 PLUTO indicates destruction at a political level, or of government owned properties. It may happen somewhere else as well, and the impact could be felt a little later in India. July 22, 2024: Monday: K.1: Shravan: auspicious day It is an auspicious day to learn, research, read, share with others, get feedback, and work on improvement. Use market intelligence and avoid contrarian trade. Follow the leader and trend-setting stocks. The first half will be bearish but expect recovery in the second half. Buy today, sell tomorrow (BTST) is indicated. Companies declaring positive profits can be aggressively chased. July 23, 2024: Tuesday: K.2: Dhanishta: bullish day to book profits. A higher opening cannot be ruled out, and select companies with positive results will hog the limelight. A good bull trap can be laid today. So, operators would be active, and one should not fall for their deceptive rumours and signals. Avoid small temptations  unless the risk-reward ratio is hugely positive. Cement and healthcare businesses are looking very attractive on this day. A wide close (or movement?) cannot be ruled out, in whichever direction the market closes. Take a contrarian position in overnight trades. July 24, 2024: Wednesday: K.3/4: Shatataraka: deceptive day Tithi 4 will yield a lot of influence. It generates deceptive signals on the charts, and most traders and participants tend to fall prey. Erratic price movements are seen on such days, when seasoned players are active. We are expecting a negative day today. Sell today, buy tomorrow (STBT) is recommended in  overnight positions. July 25, 2024: Thursday: K.5: P. Bhadrapada: good day, high momentum day Tithi gives the best results on momentum breakout signals. This  combination of the tithi and nakshatra is the deadliest. It has the power to generate 5 percent-plus movement in the indices. We suggest caution, especially while entering leveraged positions. It is extremely difficult to predict the direction of the momentum. Opening levels would indicate the close. July 26, 2024: Friday: K.6: U. Bhadrapada: auspicious day Tithi 6 makes for  a nice corrective movement. The nakshatra is known for contrarian trades, which means that reversion systems should do well today. This also means square offs will see big profits, or in-the-money positions. Broadly, the week looks like it will favour the bulls, but  a lot of wealth destruction will also happen.

"Trading Plan: Will Nifty, Bank Nifty see more selling pressure ahead of budget day?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trading-plan-will-nifty-bank-nifty-see-more-selling-pressure-ahead-of-budget-day-12773747.html,Market,"July 21, 2024 12:07 AM","Bulls turned cautious ahead of the Union Budget 2024 scheduled next week, losing control over Dalal Street to bears on July 19. The Nifty 50 formed bearish reversal patterns on daily and weekly charts. If the index decisively closes below 24,500, bears may turn strong. However, on the higher side, the 24,800-24,900 range can be crucial. For the Bank Nifty, failure to hold 52,000 can bring severe selling pressure, while 52,800 is likely to be crucial for an upward rally, experts said. On Friday, the Nifty 50 fell 270 points, or 1 percent, to 24,531, and the Bank Nifty declined 355 points, or 0.7 percent, to 52,266, while both ended flat for the week. On the NSE, 1,984 shares declined, while 353 shares advanced. Nifty Outlook and Strategy Vinay Rajani, Senior Technical/Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities The Nifty 50 has formed a Bearish Engulfing pattern on the daily chart and a Shooting Star candlestick pattern on the weekly timeframes, indicating a short-term bearish trend reversal. However, a bearish trend reversal would be confirmed once the Nifty breaks the support level of 24,500. Indicators and oscillators have also turned bearish on the daily chart. Key Resistance: 24,678, 24,855 Key Support: 24,500, 24,141 Strategy: Sell Nifty below 24,500 with a stop-loss of 24,678 and a target of 24,141. Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities The chart pattern suggests that if Nifty crosses and sustains above the 24,800 level, it would witness buying, leading the index towards the 25,000-25,300 levels. However, if the index breaks below the 24,500 level, it would witness profit booking, taking the index down towards the 24,200-24,000 levels for the week. We expect Nifty to trade in the range of 25,000-24,000 with a positive bias. The weekly strength indicator RSI (Relative Strength Index) is moving upwards and is quoting above its reference line, indicating a positive bias, whereas the daily RSI is in negative terrain indicating a loss of strength on the short-term chart. Key Resistance: 24,600, 24,750 Key Support: 24,300, 24,200 Strategy: Buy Nifty near 24,400 with a stop-loss of 24,300 and a target of 24,590-24,700. Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst - Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One As we approach the upcoming Budget week, it is important to note that the volatility index may experience an uptick. This is due to India VIX teetering on the edge of a consolidation breakout on the daily time frame leading up to the Budget week. As far as levels are concerned, a sustainable plunge below 24,500 is likely to provide more respite to the benchmark Nifty 50 for a potential downside to 24,300-24,200 (20 DEMA - Exponential Moving Average) on an intermediate basis, while the sacrosanct support lies at the 24,000 mark. The trading range is highly anticipated to broaden amidst the Budget week, and hence, proper risk management is warranted for participants. Furthermore, considering the elevated parameters and rising volatility, caution is recommended. On the contrary, the record high of 24,800-24,850 could now be seen as a daunting task for the bulls in the comparable period. On the options front, the highest open interest concentration is at the 24,500 strike Put, breaching which could trigger a sell-off towards the immediate build-up around the 24,200 strike Put. Key Resistance: 24,800, 24,850 Key Support: 24,200, 24,000 Strategy: Sell below 24,500 and book profit near the 24,200-24,100 levels, with a stop-loss of 24,700. Bank Nifty - Outlook and Positioning Vinay Rajani, Senior Technical/Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities Bank Nifty has been trading in a tight range for the last two consecutive weeks. There is multiple bottom support placed near 52,100. Any level below 52,100 could drag the index down towards the next supports of 51,750 and 50,850. On the higher side, 52,800 would offer resistance, and unless the index closes above that, the short-term trend is likely to remain on the bearish side. A level below 51,750 could intensify the selling pressure on the index. Key Resistance: 52800, 53,357 Key Support: 51,750, 50,850 Strategy: Sell Bank Nifty below 51,750 with a stop-loss of 52,500 and a target of 50,850. Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities On the weekly chart, the Bank Nifty has formed a Doji candlestick formation, indicating indecisiveness amongst market participants regarding the direction. The chart pattern suggests that if Bank Nifty crosses and sustains above the 52,800 level, it would witness buying, leading the index towards the 53,400-53,800 levels. However, if the index breaks below the 51,800 level, it would witness selling, taking the index towards the 51,500-51,000 levels. For the week, we expect Bank Nifty to trade in the range of 53,000-51,000 levels with a mixed bias. The weekly strength indicator RSI is moving upwards and quoting above their respective reference lines, indicating a positive bias. Key Resistance: 52,600, 52,800 Key Support: 52,000, 51,800 Strategy: Buy Bank Nifty near 52,000 with a stop-loss of 51,800 and a target of 52,450-52,650. Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst - Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One Going forward, unless we witness a move beyond the boundaries of its current trading range, one should avoid venturing into any positions. One silver lining for the Bank Nifty is the sturdiness of its major constituents like SBI and ICICI Bank, in the face of some intense selling in the broader market. Such counters holding their ground in the background of a relatively shaky broader market augurs well for it. Also, the index holding above its 20DEMA scores a point for bulls. However, until a move beyond the confines of the above-mentioned trading range is observed, participants should adopt a wait-and-watch approach. As far as levels are concerned, the previously established high in the 53,300-53,400 zone remains a stiff hurdle, while immediate resistance is placed in the 52,700-52,800 zone. On the other hand, immediate supports for the index are placed in the 52,000-51,800 zone. On the options front, the highest open interest concentration is at the 52,000 strike Put, suggesting a strong support base. Key Resistance: 52,800, 53,000 Key Support: 52,000, 51,800 Strategy: Sell on a rise of 52,500-52,600 and book profit near 52,000, with a stop-loss of 52,900.

Infosys has beaten its nearest rivals on metrics such as constant currency (CC) revenue growth and margins. However, the Bengaluru-based company’s headcount declined in Q1, which is the sixth consecutive quarter of the company shedding employees. If HCL Technologies' divestment of its stake in a joint venture with financial services firm State Street is discounted, which sent its headcount crashing by over 8,000, Infosys’ performance was the poorest on this metric. In April, HCL Tech divested its entire 49 percent stake in a joint venture, formed in 2012, with the US company.  On the attrition front, all IT companies reported a decline as the job market has cooled from the heydays of the post-pandemic years. Also read: India's top 3 IT firms report over 4,500 headcount reductions in Q1 Revenue growth for most companies was positive in Q1, barring HCLTech, which reported a decline of 1.5 percent. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Wipro were behind Infosys on this metric by about 2 and 1 percent, respectively. On the margins front, Infosys jumped 100 basis points (bps) sequentially to 21.1 percent. On the other hand, tech behemoth TCS declined 140 bps, to 24.7 percent. HCLTech’s margin declined by 50 bps to 16.6 percent, while Wipro’s increased marginally. Nonetheless, most companies reported a decent quarter on the total contract value (TCV) metric. TCS led with over $8 billion worth of TCV, double that of Infosys and almost triple the value of Wipro’s wins. HCLTech’s TCV fell shy of $2 billion. What the CEOs said The management of these IT firms appear to be cautiously optimistic as they  desisted from commenting on estimated recovery timelines in discretionary spending, adding that there have been pockets of recovery with clients becoming more open to spending on critical and large transformation projects. Technology spending is also being seen in generative AI proofs of concept and projects. For companies like TCS, HCLTech, and Wipro, growth has been broad-based, across all verticals and geographies, while Infosys' BFSI vertical delivery sequestially. ""There's nothing new to add in terms of market sentiment. However, as mentioned last quarter, we believe it will be a stronger FY25 compared to FY24,"" said K Krithivasan, CEO, TCS. The management noted that Latin America, Middle East and Africa, and India continued to have strong growth in line with their diversification strategy. As for Infosys, it increased its revenue growth guidance for FY25 to 3-4 percent from the previous 1-3 percent. The company’s CEO, Salil Parekh, said, “If you look at the first quarter, our year-on-year growth has been 2.5 percent... That is a one-off. We have always maintained that our H1 is going to be better than H2, and the guidance shows that. “And then there is the revenue from in-tech (a firm acquired by Infosys). All that put together makes for a guidance of 3 to 4 percent,” he added. Infosys acquired in-tech, an engineering R&D services provider with a focus on the German automotive industry, in April 2024. HCLTech has retained its full-year revenue growth guidance of 3-5 percent YoY  in CC terms. The firm's CEO and MD C Vijayakumar said, “We have not factored any significant pick up in discretionary spends. Our assumption is this year will be the same as last year… Though we see some actions which indicate that things could have bottomed out, I do not want to take a call… because there have been so many false starts in the last few quarters.” He expects that in Q2, the company will grow in all geographies and verticals, except financial services. Wipro too had raised its sequential growth guidance to -1 percent to 1 percent in CC terms. This comes after the company slashed its guidance last quarter to -1.5 to 0.5 percent. “We're still not seeing a significant change in the demand environment. We see clients still cautious and the discretionary spend is low. However, we have seen an uptick in the consulting (through its acquisition Capco), BFSI, and consumer sectors  in the US,” said Wipro CEO Srini Pallia. This quarter, green shoots were visible across these companies in the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) space, especially in north America. Both the vertical and the geography account for over 30-40 percent and 50-60 percent of the revenues, respectively, of these companies. Though still reporting negative growth in most cases, the management of these four companies believes that the BFSI vertical will continue to grow. “We have seen a change in financial services in the US, which indicates positive outcomes in this quarter,” Parekh said.

Analysts expect modest impact on stock following UltraTech-India Cement deal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/analysts-expect-modest-impact-on-stock-following-ultratech-india-cement-deal-12780359.html,Stocks,"July 28, 2024 04:59 PM","Market experts expect a modest impact on the stock prices of UltraTech Cement and India Cements following the former's acquisition of a 32.72 percent stake in the southern cement major even though they believe the deal is an important one within the cement space. “The Rs 390 offer price is a modest 4 percent premium over the current market price, so, any significant movement in India Cements' stock on Monday is unlikely, given its recent gains. For UltraTech Cement, the industry's consolidation will likely result in a positive trading outcome on Monday, affirming its market leader status post-acquisition,” said Axis Securities' Uttam Kumar Srimal Independent analyst Ambreesh Baliga said that investing in UltraTech is advisable for long-term gains rather than short-term trading while highlighting the fact that developments like UltraTech Cement acquiring India Cements and Adani’s acquisition of Ambuja Cements and ACC clearly show that industry consolidation is underway. “This trend suggests that the cement industry will soon be dominated by two to three large players, making it difficult for smaller players to compete and likely leading to their acquisition. With ongoing infrastructure and real estate development, cement demand will continue to rise. Since greenfield projects take over 30 months to complete, acquiring smaller players is a strategic move for quick raw material access,” said Baliga The latest acquisition will increase UltraTech Cement’s ownership in India Cements to 55.49 percent, pending regulatory approvals. It will trigger an open offer by UltraTech Cement to buy up to 8.05 crore shares, or 26 percent of the equity, from public shareholders at Rs 390 per share, totalling approximately Rs 3,142.39 crore. While the initial acquisition of a 22.77 percent stake was completed in June, the latest purchase marks the complete stake sale and exit of promoter N Srinivasan from India Cements. ""Now, UltraTech Cement has acquired a controlling stake in India Cements, valuing the deal at $123 per tonne for 14 million tonnes of assets, which is reasonable. UltraTech can optimise these assets with modifications and improvements, facilitating expansion in the same region. This will boost UltraTech's market share in the competitive southern market and contribute to industry consolidation, benefiting companies like UltraTech, Ambuja, ACC, and Dalmia Bharat,” said Kumar of Axis Securities. Interestingly, analysts also believe that while the cement sector is consolidating, Adani's acquisition of ACC and Ambuja has disrupted the market, eroding volumes and blurring regional differences in pricing and positioning. Earlier, the north, south, east, and west had distinct market dynamics, but this has changed post-Adani's acquisition. Shyam Sekhar, portfolio manager and investor, wrote on X, “The South Indian cement industry will never be the same again. Expect the industry to quickly slip into turmoil. The man who held the industry together officially quits the scene. After this, the ensuing free-for-all will see politics, market pressures, ego battles, and greed exert pressures not seen in the industry for the past two decades. Very bad days ahead for Southern cement companies. Their golden era is as good as over. I am calling it today.” Read more: UltraTech Cement board approves acquisition of India Cements The latest acquisition, valued at Rs 3,954 crore for 32.72 percent equity at Rs 390 per share, is contingent on regulatory approvals and will trigger a mandatory open offer at the same price. The earlier acquisition in June was made at Rs 268 per share.

About 1,593 shares advanced, against 756 declining shares on the NSE. If the index sustains above 24,800, then 25,000 is the level to watch; below this level, 24,600 is likely to be immediate support. Here are some trading ideas for the near term: Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities Info Edge (Naukri) | CMP: Rs 7,187.4  Info Edge is in a strong uptrend across all time frames, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms, indicating a positive bias. It has confirmed the ""Rounding Bottom"" breakout on a weekly line chart, indicating a positive bias. On the daily chart, the stock has witnessed a three-week consolidation range breakout at Rs 7,095 levels on a closing basis. This breakout is accompanied by huge volumes, indicating increased participation. The stock has recaptured its 20-day SMA (Simple Moving Average Rs 6,793) and rebounded sharply, indicating bullish sentiments. The daily ""Bollinger Band"" buy signals show increased momentum. The daily, weekly, and monthly strength indicator RSI (Relative Strength Index) is in positive terrain, which justifies rising strength across all time frames. Investors should buy, hold, and accumulate this stock. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 7,600, Rs 7,885 Stop-Loss: Rs 7,030, Rs 6,800 Mahanagar Gas | CMP: Rs 1,846  Mahanagar Gas is in a strong uptrend across all time frames, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms, indicating a positive bias. It has also confirmed a ""Pennant"" continuation pattern, indicating bullish sentiments. Huge rising volumes at breakout zones signify increased participation. The stock is placed above its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day SMAs, and these averages are also inching up along with the price rise, which reaffirms the bullish trend. The daily, weekly, and monthly strength indicator RSI is in positive terrain, which justifies rising strength across all time frames. Investors should buy, hold, and accumulate this stock. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,980, Rs 2,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,770, Rs 1,660 Snowman Logistics | CMP: Rs 85.33  Since November 2023, Snowman Logistics has been consolidating within a broad range (Rs 83-55), representing strong accumulation. However, with Friday's gain, the stock has confirmed a ""consolidation zone"" breakout at Rs 83 levels on a closing basis. This breakout is accompanied by huge volumes, indicating increased participation. Recently, the stock has recaptured its 20, 50, and 100-day SMAs, which reconfirms a bullish trend. The daily and weekly ""Bollinger Band"" buy signals show increased momentum. The daily, weekly, and monthly strength indicator RSI is in positive terrain, which justifies rising strength across all time frames. Investors should buy, hold, and accumulate this stock. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 99-113 Stop-Loss: Rs 80, Rs 75 Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst at Angel One Apollo Hospitals Enterprise | CMP: Rs 6,664.55  Apollo Hospitals has been in a consolidation phase for the past few months, but a bullish 'Saucer' pattern on the daily chart suggests the potential resumption of the primary uptrend. This breakout is confirmed by a strong bullish candle. Prices have been finding solid support at the 20-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average), with recent dips being bought into. Additionally, a fresh positive crossover is occurring as the 50-day EMA crosses above the 89-day EMA. Given this setup, we have a positive outlook on the stock. Hence, we recommend buying the stock around Rs 6,666 - Rs 6,660. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 7,175 Stop-Loss: Rs 6,388 Eicher Motors | CMP: Rs 5,012.5  For the past few weeks, Nifty Auto Index has been trading within a tight range of 26,000 - 24,800. On Friday, we saw a bullish breakout, leading to a broad-based rally in this sector. Eicher Motors also experienced a significant breakout, closing above Rs 4,980 levels, which had previously acted as strong resistance. This breakout confirms a bullish continuation with an ‘Ascending Triangle’ pattern. Prices have now entered uncharted territory, indicating strong momentum driven by the bulls. Hence, we recommend buying Eicher Motors around Rs 5,010 - Rs 5,000. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 5,290 Stop-Loss: Rs 4,860 Quess Corp | CMP: Rs 711.15  During the last week, Quess Corp experienced strong positive momentum, confirming a bullish reversal pattern known as the ‘Inverse Head and Shoulders’ on the weekly chart. This breakout is backed by a significant surge in volume and a large bullish candle. Prices are positioned above key moving averages, and oscillators are positively aligned, reinforcing the buy signal. Hence, we recommend buying Quess Corp around Rs 711 - Rs 705. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 790 Stop-Loss: Rs 669 Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical and Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities One 97 Communications (Paytm) | CMP: Rs 509  Paytm has been consistently making higher tops and higher bottoms over the last few weeks. Last week (ended July 26), the stock bounced from the 20-day SMA and cleared its nearby resistances on the back of above-average volumes. With momentum readings like the 14-day RSI also in rising mode, this suggests that the uptrend will continue. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 570 Stop-Loss: Rs 455 Piramal Enterprises | CMP: Rs 992  Piramal Enterprises has been consistently moving higher over the last few weeks. Last week, the stock broke out of its recent range on the back of above-average volumes. Technical indicators are giving positive signals, as there was a recent positive moving average crossover with the 20-day SMA moving above the 50-day SMA. With the 14-week RSI also in rising mode and above its 9-week EMA, we expect the stock to head higher in the coming sessions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 925 Campus Activewear | CMP: Rs 311  Campus Activewear reversed its intermediate downtrend in April 2024 and has since been making higher tops and higher bottoms. Last week, it broke out of a trading range on the back of healthy volumes. Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI are also in rising mode and not overbought.

Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 360 Stop-Loss: Rs 282 Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi IDFC First Bank | CMP: Rs 74.5  After reaching a peak near Rs 101 in September 2023, IDFC First Bank experienced a substantial correction of Rs 30, translating to a 29.34 percent decline from its high. Recently, the stock found support near the 0.618 retracement level of its previous upmove from 53 to 101. Additionally, a bullish BAT pattern has formed precisely at this 0.618 retracement level, making the current levels attractive for buying. Based on these technical indicators, buying in the Rs 72-75 zone is recommended. The target price is set at Rs 84, with a stop-loss placed near Rs 68.5 on a daily close basis.

"ICICI Bank sees mild LCR impact from RBI's draft norms, LDR to stay stable",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/icici-bank-sees-mild-lcr-impact-from-rbis-draft-norms-ldr-to-stay-stable-12780065.html,Stocks,"July 27, 2024 07:44 PM","ICICI Bank expects some impact on loan and deposit growth from the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) draft liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) norms but did not provide specific figures during their earnings call. ""Over the next couple of quarters, we will need to consider the implications of the revised LCR guidelines, which will affect both deposit and loan markets. We will have to assess this as we move forward,"" the management stated. In a draft circular released on July 25, the RBI asked banks to account for the possibility of retail deposits being withdrawn digitally when calculating the LCR. Currently, banks are required to maintain an LCR of 100 percent. LCR norms require banks to maintain a stock of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA), mainly government securities, to manage a potential 30-day period of significant deposit outflows. ALSO READ: IndusInd Bank forecasts 4-6% impact from RBI's new draft LCR norms The new guidelines mandate banks to hold more liquidity for deposits made through digital channels, as these are considered less stable and more likely to be withdrawn quickly. The RBI has proposed increasing the run-off factor on retail deposits made via Internet and mobile banking (IMB) from the current 5 percent to 10 percent. Typically, the run-off factor on retail deposits is lower because they are considered stable. Run-offs occur when individuals or businesses withdraw their deposits unexpectedly. Under the new guidelines, stable retail deposits with internet and mobile banking will have a 10 percent run-off factor, and less stable deposits will have a 15 percent run-off factor. The banking industry views this move as conservative, as it would require banks to invest more in government securities and slow down credit growth. Given that system liquidity is tight and deposit mobilisation is already slow, the impact on banks will be significant. They will need to keep deposit rates high and temper growth to align with funding. Regarding the loan-to-deposit ratio, ICICI Bank does not foresee a significant change. ""We have historically operated at a low to mid-80s domestic LDR. I don't see any big change in that. It may vary slightly from quarter to quarter, but overall, it should remain at that level for both deposit and loan growth,"" they added. In the quarter ending in June, ICICI Bank reported a 16 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in domestic loans, while average deposits increased by 18 percent YoY. The private lender's net profit grew by 14.6 percent YoY to Rs 11,059 crore in Q1FY25, and net interest income rose by 7.3 percent YoY to Rs 19,552 crore.

"Jigar Patel of Anand Rathi says 24,860 crucial for further rally in Nifty, bets on these 3 stocks for healthy returns",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jigar-patel-of-anand-rathi-says-24860-crucial-for-further-rally-in-nifty-betson-these-3-stocks-for-healthy-returns-12780091.html,Stocks,"July 27, 2024 07:06 PM","By Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi The Indian markets experienced a highly eventful week (ended July 26), largely influenced by the Union Budget 2024. The Nifty corrected towards the 24,000 mark as the budget sparked some disappointment among investors, and by Thursday, the FII’s long-to-short ratio had decreased to 57 percent. By Friday, market sentiment had reversed dramatically, with bullish investors driving the index to a new all-time high of 24,861, which resulted into a gain of over 1 percent compared to the previous week's close. Looking ahead, if the Nifty moves above 24,860, it could potentially reach the significant milestone of 25,000 and possibly higher. At that juncture, we would need to reassess the market conditions and develop a new trading strategy, particularly considering the risk of negative divergence in the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI). On the downside, the 24,400 level is expected to provide strong support for the coming week; any breach of this level could weaken the current momentum. The Nifty Bank index continued to underperform relative to the broader market benchmarks. The Union Budget 2024 did not provide substantial support for the banking sector, leading to its underperformance. According to our analysis, the index approached the 50,000 mark by Thursday’s session but found support at the trendline breakout extension, which prompted a sharp rebound during Friday’s session. Moving forward, a breach of the 50,000 level could indicate further pessimism for the index. Otherwise, we expect a continued recovery for the Bank Nifty, with potential upward movement towards the 52,000-52,500 range in the coming sessions. Here are three stocks to pick for short term: IDFC First Bank | CMP: Rs 74.5  After reaching a peak near Rs 101 in September 2023, IDFC First Bank experienced a substantial correction of Rs 30, translating to a 29.34 percent decline from its high. Recently, the stock found support near the 0.618 retracement level of its previous upmove from 53 to 101. Additionally, a bullish BAT pattern has formed precisely at this 0.618 retracement level, making the current levels attractive for buying. Based on these technical indicators, buying in the Rs 72-75 zone is recommended. The target price is set at Rs 84, with a stop-loss placed near Rs 68.5 on a daily close basis. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 84 Stop-Loss: Rs 68.5 Cipla | CMP: Rs 1,575  Apart from the previous trading session, Cipla has been trading within a narrow price range of Rs 1,485-Rs 1,535. This indicates a period of consolidation, where the stock's price has been relatively stable and moving sideways. However, during the previous trading session, Cipla decisively broke above this range with massive volume, suggesting further bullish momentum. On the indicator front, the RSI has reversed from the 50 level, which further affirms our bullish bias. Therefore, we recommend buying Cipla during pullbacks near Rs 1,525-1,540 range, targeting an upside of Rs 1,635. To manage risk, a stop-loss should be set near Rs 1,495 on a daily close basis. Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone | CMP: Rs 1,543  Excluding the previous trading session, Adani Ports has been trading within a price range of Rs 1,480-Rs 1,520, indicating a period of consolidation where the stock's price has remained relatively stable and moved sideways. However, during the last trading session, Adani Ports decisively broke above this range and closed higher, suggesting further bullish momentum. On the indicator front, the RSI has reversed from the 50 level, which further supports our bullish outlook. Therefore, we recommend buying Adani Ports during pullbacks near Rs 1,530-1,540 range, with a target of Rs 1,650. To manage risk, a stop-loss should be set near Rs 1,480 on a daily close basis.

During the week, the BSE Midcap, LargeCap and Smllcap indices rose 3 percent, 1.5 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively. In this week, BSE Sensex rose 728.07 points or 0.90 percent to finish at 81,332.72, while Nifty50 index added 303.9 points or 1.23 percent to end at 24,834.80. On July 26, Nifty50 index touched fresh record high of 24,861.15, while BSE Sensex also went near to its record high of 81587.76. On the sectoral front, BSE Power, Healthcare and Auto indices rose 5 percent each, BSE Telecom index added 4 percent and BSE oil & Gas index rose 3.4 percent. On the other hand, BSE Bank index shed 2.5 percent and Realty index fell 1.7 percent. ""The Budget 2024-25 has not sparked any significant excitement in the market, while it was both populist and prudent. The increase in short- and long-term capital gains taxes added to the volatility on budget day. Many of the measures are a reiteration of the interim budget, and the broader market appears to be losing momentum due to a lack of new impetus. Although the government's emphasis on fiscal discipline and growth is appealing, FIIs are cautious due to current high valuations and muted expectations for Q1FY25 results. Meanwhile, DIIs continue to employ a ""buy on dips"" strategy, which contributed to market gains on the week's last trading day, particularly in the pharma, auto, metal, IT, and FMCG sectors,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services. ""The market has now recovered its losses from budget day, driven by positive US GDP data and expectations of improved global demand. Moving forward, the direction of the domestic market will likely be influenced by the progress of the earnings season. Additionally, global economic updates, including US Fed & BoE monetary policies, US employment data, and Eurozone GDP figures, are expected to impact market trends,"" he added. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) turned net sellers in this week as they sold equities worth of Rs 4,721.26 crore, however, Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) turned net buyers as they bought equities worth Rs 8,109.78 crore. The BSE Small-cap index added 3.5 percent with Antony Waste Handling Cell, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam, Bhagiradh Chemicals and Industries, PC Jeweller, Gravita India, Protean eGov Technologies, PG Electroplast, EMS adding 25-50 percent. On the other hand, Ircon International, KSolves India, Phoenix Mills, VST Industries, Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers lost between 10-13 percent.  Where is Nifty50 headed? Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities The immediate supports like 10/20-day EMAs have been regained after violating below it recently. These moving averages have been offering supports for the Nifty in the last 5-6 weeks. The positive chart pattern like higher tops and bottoms is intact on the daily chart and Nifty seems to have confirmed a new higher bottom formation recently. The short-term trend of Nifty has turned into positive. The next upside levels to be watched around 25000-25100 in the near term. Immediate support is placed at 24650 levels. Jatin Gedia – Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas This current upmove can extend towards 25350 – 25530. Support base now stands at 24400 which is the 20-day moving average. The daily momentum indicator still has a negative crossover however we shall assign more weightage to the price action and ride the up move. Tejas Shah, Technical Research, JM Financial & BlinkX We expect an upward trending activity to continue and the index should move towards the next psychological resistance of 25,000 either continuously from the current levels or may be after a minor dip. The short term moving averages are also below the price action and should continue to support the indices on any decline. Support for the Nifty is now seen at 24,650 and 24,450-500 levels. On the higher side, immediate resistance for Nifty is at 24,850 levels and the next psychological resistance is at 25,000 mark.

How to approach sideways market with Options: Shubham Agarwal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/expert-columns/how-to-approach-sideways-market-with-options-shubham-agarwal-12779600.html,Stocks,"July 27, 2024 10:32 AM","Shubham Agarwal Since the beginning of the pre-budget worries earlier this month, indices have been fairly range-bound. This has created a bit of difficulty for many trend followers. It is difficult to profit out of this tight range especially once we are in it for a week or so. Now you do not know how long it is going to last. We are within the range or at the edge. Either of the cases has its own difficulties and very low success rate. But when we match it with Options trades with fairly high success rates, it all works out. Let us see how: 1. Trading range breakout with back ratio spreads This strategy involves selling one Option with strike closer to current market price and buying not one but 2 Options of Higher Strike Call (against Call Sold), or Lower Strike Puts (against Puts Sold). With back ratio of the break takes place, one would end up making good money after a big move due to the very fact that there are 2 Options bought against one sold. On the other hand, if the volatility is on the other side and if the big opposite move sets in, all options will start reducing towards zero. This would be ok too because net premium outflow if all goes to zero is also negligible. Only caution is the big view of volatility. If volatility does not come around in next couple of days then get rid of the trade. Again, the cost of carrying the trade for 2-3 sessions would not be so much. Also, make sure there is at least a week left for the expiry. 2. Contra trades within the range with OTM spreads When previous trend is bullish and we feel the consolidation could end up in break-down, do OTM Spreads. For a bearish trade one does a Put spread. OTM Spreads are created by buying slightly lower Strike Put and selling further lower strike Put. Benefit of this strategy is the initial outflow (net premium paid) is low. Max profit, which is difference between the strikes minus the premium paid is generally 2-3 times the maximum loss of Net Premium paid. We are saved in case of few days of consolidation before the reverse move since we have one option bought against one sold. Most importantly, in case we are proven wrong with no chance to exit at desired stop loss level the max loss is limited. 3. Reversal moves with intraday long Options Typically, we end up on a day in the market where things look overdone. Such is the situation that calls for intraday trade in favour of range. Bullish trade in a highly oversold market and bearish in an overbought market. Here is where instead of Buying a Future go long (buy) on a Call / Put for bullish / bearish trade. If everything works out and the reversal takes place, we make our quick buck. If the market continues with the direction, the cost of taking a brave trade is small. Only thing is one must keep it time bound. Close the trade during the day or next day.

"Wall Street closes up on revival supported by inflation data, tech stocks",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/wall-street-closes-up-on-revival-supported-by-inflation-data-tech-stocks-12779914.html,Stocks,"July 27, 2024 10:25 AM","Wall Street's major indexes ended higher on Friday as investors flocked back to tech megacaps that had triggered broad sell-offs earlier in the week, and inflation data boosted optimism that the Federal Reserve will soon commence cutting interest rates. For the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, the advances could not completely recoup the ground lost in the two previous sessions, with both indexes ending the week lower for the second consecutive week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended in positive territory for the week. Its Friday gains were aided by industrial conglomerate 3M, which jumped 23% to its largest daily percentage gain in decades after it raised the lower end of its annual adjusted profit forecast. Five members of the so-called Magnificent Seven rose on Friday, led by Meta Platforms which climbed 2.7%. The two exceptions were Tesla and Alphabet, whose lackluster earnings had triggered Wednesday's big market sell-off. They both fell 0.2%, with Alphabet dropping to its lowest close since May 2. With further Magnificent Seven earnings due next week, the immediate outlook for markets may hinge on what type of results these companies deliver. ""What we get next week from Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com and Meta is really going to set the tone for whether that rotation continues and, directionally, where the market goes,"" said Greg Boutle, head of US equity & derivative strategy at BNP Paribas. The rotation involves moving out of a set of high-momentum stocks, whose valuations now appear inflated, to underperforming sectors like mid- and small-cap stocks. This shift seems to have gained momentum in recent weeks, with the small-cap Russell 2000 (.RUT), opens new tab and S&P Small Cap 600 both advancing to their fourth closing highs of the week. The Russell 2000 scored its third straight weekly gain in two months and its best three-week run since August 2022. These economically sensitive small-caps were supported on Friday by the moderate rise in June U.S. prices, which underlined cooling inflation and potentially positions the Fed to start easing policy in September. Bets on a 25-basis-point cut at the Fed's September meeting held steady at about 88% after the PCE reading, according to CME's FedWatch. Traders still largely expect two rate cuts by December, LSEG data showed. ""We did see (the stable economic data) as beneficial for that broadening trade,"" said Adam Hetts, global head of multi-asset at Janus Henderson, noting small-caps had outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 10% over the last month. The broadening trade has also benefited cyclical sectors of the economy. On Friday, all 11 of the S&P sectors were higher, with Industrials and Materials the leading gainers. On Friday, the S&P 500 gained 59.88 points, or 1.11%, at 5,459.10 points, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 176.16 points, or 1.03%, to 17,357.88. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 654.27 points, or 1.64%, to 40,589.34. For the week, the Dow gained 0.75%, while the S&P 500 declined 0.82% and the Nasdaq dropped 2.08%. Among stocks boosted by earnings, Deckers Outdoor jumped 6.3% after it raised its annual profit forecast, while oilfield services firm Baker Hughes climbed 5.8% after beating estimates for second-quarter profit. Norfolk Southern soared 10.9%, its largest one-day percentage gain since March 2020, after the rail operator reported second-quarter profit above Wall Street estimates thanks to robust pricing. Medical device maker Dexcom slumped 40.6% after cutting its annual revenue forecast. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.92 billion shares, compared with the 11.61 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

The companies are free to refile their prospectus as early as Monday. Vishal Mega Mart had filed its draft prospectus under confidential filing two weeks ago, while Avanse Financial filed its DRHP on June 21. “The reason for sending back the prospectuses was technical queries – it’s not a rejection,” the sources confirmed. “The companies could file the papers back as early as Monday,” one source added. Vishal Mega Mart is supported by a consortium of Kedaara Capital and Partners Group. The company is a leading fashion-led hypermarket chain and intends to raise close to $1 billion from the market.

"PSU workers see more injuries, have fewer trained staff compared to private firms, says report",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/psu-workers-see-more-injuries-have-fewer-trained-staff-compared-to-private-firms-says-report-12779637.html,Stocks,"July 26, 2024 06:23 PM","Public sector undertakings (PSUs) in FY23 reported significantly higher rates of high-consequence work injuries and fatalities compared to the private sector, according to a latest report by IIAS, a proxy advisory firm. In FY23, PSUs reported an average of 2.4 high-consequence work injuries, compared to 1.7 in the private sector. The disparity extends to fatalities as well, with PSUs experiencing an average of 2.2 fatalities, significantly higher than the 0.8 reported in the private sector. The report considered Nifty 500 companies for the analysis.  High consequence injuries are severe injuries that result in significant and long-lasting impacts on an individual's health. This reason in part can be explained by the nature of the PSU business that tends to focus on the manufacturing sector especially sectors like metals, mining, power, and oil & gas, said the report. Another probable cause is that PSUs lag behind private sector companies in training their workforce, it added. The percentage of workforce trained in PSUs indeed lags behind that of private sector companies as in FY23, only 42 percent of PSU employees received training compared to 71 percent in the private sector.  Average fatalities were the highest in oil, gas, energy, and allied services at 5. Further, average fatalities were at 1.7 for services and 1.3 for utilities, said the report. On Insurance The report said that 327 out of Nifty 500 companies have provided health and accident insurance coverage to all of their workforce including employees and workers. ""As health insurance among workforce increases, average time lost due to injury comes down. This is because workers get the right treatment and are able to resume work within a shorter duration,"" said the report.

According to a Moneycontrol poll of six brokerages, NTPC is likely to see a marginal increase of 0.07 percent in revenue at Rs 43,424 crore compared to Rs 43,390 crore reported in the same quarter last year.  Further, net profit is likely to fall 3.5 percent to Rs 4,733 crore in the June quarter, from Rs 4,907 crore in the corresponding quarter during the previous fiscal year. The most optimistic estimate sees NTPC’s net profit jumping 9 percent year-on-year, but the most pessimistic projection suggests that net profit will fall around 1.5 percent. What factors are impacting the earnings? Analysts at JM Financial expect NTPC to report a revenue of Rs 44,300 crore in Q1FY25, up 3 percent YoY. The brokerage estimates PAT to rise by 8 percent YoY due to a 10 percent YoY increase in thermal production. Here are some of the factors that can impact earnings: Increase in generation: Analysts at B&K Securities expect Q1FY25 to be a good quarter for NTPC with strong demand in the sector and the peak load increasing to 250 GW in May. ""Per our estimates, PLF for standalone generation remained strong at around 77 percent with gross generation of around 93 billion units, which is 6 percent higher than the same period last year,"" stated a report by the firm. Most brokerages are optimistic about NTPC's growing power generation. “We expect a modest growth in generation at 94 BU (+6 percent yoy) on account of expanded capacity base,” said analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities. Increase in commissioning of projects:  Analysts expect the power generation company to gain from an increase in the number of projects in both the thermal and renewable space. “With rising commissioning of projects in FY25/26 (both thermal and RE) and CERC incentives, we expect FY25 to deliver superior core RoEs vs FY24,” said analysts at Nuvama. What to look out for in the quarterly show? Analysts will closely monitor the management’s commentary on both renewable and thermal capex as well as power generation estimates to meet growing power demand. They will also keep a watch on the planned NTPC Green Energy IPO in September 2024.

However, higher recoveries from written-off accounts + PSLC fees, partly offset by higher opex/provisions, helped the bank deliver RoA of 1.3%. Slippages were seasonally higher in retail/agri, but overall asset quality is holding up well, with GNPA ratio at 2.1%. After a nail-biting wait, the RBI has finally cleared KVS Manian as the new MD and CEO (wef 23- Sep-2024), who will replace existing MD/CEO Shyam Srinivasan.

Buy Axis Bank; target of Rs 1400: Emkay,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/buy-axis-bank-target-of-rs-1400-emkay-12779458.html,Stocks,"July 26, 2024 03:51 PM","Emkay's research report on Axis Bank Axis Bank logged a 10% earnings miss, with PAT/ROA lower at Rs60bn/~1.6% mainly due to LLP being higher (0.9% of loans) on account of higher NPAs/slower recoveries, and partly offset by lower opex. Credit growth was relatively moderate, but better LDR, rising share of unsecured loans, and a oneoff interest on IT refund helped Axis report flattish NIMs at 4.1%. The mgmt believes the higher NPA formation/LLP was a one-off and should trend down; this along with moderating cost (with the Citi integration pain largely behind) should help offset any margin/LLP pressure. Building-in the 1Q miss amid rising noise on unsecured loans and thus LLP, we cut FY25-27E earnings by ~3%. But we still expect the bank to report healthy RoA of ~1.8%. With CET 1 below 15%, the bank has taken an enabling resolution to raise equity capital to around Rs200bn; this should hence keep RoE in check. Outlook We retain BUY on Axis Bank and TP of Rs1,400/sh, rolling-over to 1.9x Jun-26E ABV (2x FY26E ABV earlier), and subs value of Rs90/sh. MD term extension by the RBI will be keenly watched.

The approval, which was stuck for months due to the company's link to China, will remove the main stumbling block to the unit, Paytm Payment Services, resuming normal business operations. Following the approval, shares of One97 Communications, the parent company of Paytm, surged 10 percent and was locked in the upper circuit at Rs 509.05 on the NSE. This also marks the first time since February 8 that shares of Paytm surpassed the Rs 500-level. Paytm Payment Services is one of the biggest remaining parts of the fintech firm's business, accounting for a quarter of consolidated revenue in the financial year ended March 2023. Follow our live blog for all the updates Earlier this month, Reuters reported that the government had given the investment the green light. Vivek Joshi, financial services secretary, said the company can approach India's central bank to seek a payment aggregator license which the bank will evaluate. Shares of the payments aggregator have been under pressure since February following the RBI's action against its Payments Bank. In January, the shares had reached levels as high as Rs 800, however, since then, the stock has been unable to bounceback to that mark. In the June quarter, Paytm's revenue dropped by 36 percent year-over-year to Rs 1,502 crore due to ongoing challenges from RBI restrictions. The company's net loss also widened sharply to Rs 840 crore in Q1 of FY25, the steepest loss since its listing.

"PSU insurers sizzle: General Insurance, New India Assurance stocks gain up to 19%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/psu-insurers-sizzle-general-insurance-new-india-assurance-stocks-gain-up-to-19-12779376.html,Stocks,"July 26, 2024 02:34 PM","Shares of public sector insurance firms experienced a dramatic surge on July 26. New India Assurance Company's stock skyrocketed up to 19 percent and General Insurance Corporation of India (GIC-Re) shares zoomed over 16 percent intraday. Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), however, saw modest gains of 2 percent. While there was no clear trigger for the steep rally, a potential factor behind this surge could be the notably low public float of these companies. For instance, the government holds an 85.4 percent stake in New India Assurance, with LIC and GIC-Re holding 1.3 percent and 8.7 percent, respectively, leaving only about 5 percent available for public trading. Similarly, the government holds an 85.8 percent stake in GIC-RE, with LIC holding 8.7 percent stake, leaving only about 5.5 percent available for public trading. Often, stocks with such low public float show sharp moves on low volumes as fewer shares are available for trading in the open market. At 2:18 pm, New India Assurance shares were trading 19 percent higher at Rs 307.58 while GIC-Re shares were up around 16 percent at Rs 432 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). Follow our market blog to catch all the live action It is worth mentioning that public sector general insurers clocked 6.45 percent growth in premiums in Q1FY25, while private sector insurers reported a 16.37 percent rise, data released by the General Insurance Council showed. The public sector general insurers continued to lose market share in Q1. These insurers' market share stood at 33.39 percent compared to 35.7 percent in Q1FY24.

The bank guided for slower growth in FY25 with margins around 2.95-3%, but contained credit costs should help it deliver healthy RoA. Following the implementation of new investment classification norms, the bank’s CET 1 ratio has improved by 50bps QoQ to 12%.

Market-wide rollovers are at 89 percent, higher than the three-month average of 88 percent, said Nuvama Institutional Equities in its rollover report.  Nifty rollovers Nifty rollover data after yesterday's monthly expiry shows the rollover for Nifty Index futures was lower at 69.69 percent, compared to the previous month's 76.25 percent and the three-month average of 72.57 percent.""There is lower confidence in rolling over positions. The number of shares rolled declined to 13.7 million compared to 15.1 million last month. Moreover, the rollover cost has witnessed a minor dip to 0.21 percent compared to the three-month average of 0.40 percent,"" said Sudeep Shah, Deputy Vice President and Head of Technical and Derivative Research at SBI Securities. Stock futures rolloversNuvama's report highlights that stock futures rollovers stand at 93 percent, on par with average rollovers of the last three series at 93 percent. Most frontline names saw their roll cost hovering around 63-65 basis points with an average decrease in roll cost across names being 1-2 basis points day-over-day.""At the sector level, Banking and Information Technology may underperform, with the exception of HDFC Bank, which should see interest due to the MSCI weight update announcement on August 13th (Indian Standard Time). There is notable interest in HDFC Bank around the 1,550-1,600 level."" Top Stock picks for August series""Considering seasonality, industrials like Polycab, Havells, ABB, and Crompton Greaves should be viewed with a long bias. Additionally, Trent, a probable Nifty 50 inclusion, is expected to perform well in the August series (strong August seasonality). Within metals, Vedanta has strong support around 430 levels and that should be used as an entry level for a 6 percent target and 2 percent stop loss. Selective auto names should also be looked at from a short-term long idea – Ashok Leyland and Maruti Suzuki,"" said Abhilash Pagaria, Head of Nuvama Alternative and Quantitative Research. SBI securities' top picks include:  Rollover action - Sector Specific:""At the start of the August series, meaningful open interest addition is seen in Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (Rs 294 billion, long side), Pharmaceuticals (Rs 227 billion, long side), Oil & Gas (Rs 341 billion, long side), Banks (Rs 860 billion, short side), Metals (Rs 300 billion, short side) and Chemicals (Rs 104 billion, long side) sectors,"" said Pagaria.Pagaria also noted that historic high open interest is seen in Auto (Rs 339 billion), Financial Services (Rs 397 billion), Information Technology (Rs 342 billion), Capital Goods (Rs 287 billion), Consumption (Rs 100 billion), and Consumer Durables (Rs 61 billion). Reviewing July series performanceIn the July series, the Nifty index showcased a modest yet intriguing performance, trading within a tight range of 1,000 points and ultimately closing with a 1.5 percent gain at 24,400 levels. The overall index volatility appeared limited, primarily due to significant sectoral rotations. IT, FMCG, and Pharma sectors drove the gains with impressive increases of 11 percent, 10 percent, and 8 percent respectively. Conversely, the Banking sector exerted downward pressure, with Nifty Bank ending 3.5 percent lower, and Metals seeing a 6.5 percent decline.

The development assumes significance as the markets have bounced back after five consecutive days of downfall. At noon, the Sensex was up 1.48 percent at 81,222 and the Nifty was up 1.61 percent at 24,799. About 2,413 shares advanced, 9,80 shares declined, and 83 shares unchanged. Follow our LIVE blog for all the market updates The broader markets continued to shine bright after the mid and smallcap index rallied over 2 and 1 percent each. The two have rallied 25 percent and 24 percent since the start of the year. Nifty has gained 14 percent over the same period. Sectoral Trend The IT and Nifty Metal were the best performers on the Nifty. Tata Steel, Hindalco and JSWSteel were the top performers on the index. The Auto, Infra, Pharma and Realty also joined the party, rising almost 2 percent each. Experts suggest that some of the largecap pharma names have gone through a good consolidation phase in the last six months. Now, the market would be looking for sectors or stocks where the risk-reward ratio is more favourable. Bank Nifty also pared all morning losses to trade almost a percent higher. Fundamental Views V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services said that the unique feature of the ongoing bull market in India is its ability to climb all walls of worry. The market has dismissed concerns related to elections, the Budget, and the correction in the US. The 'buy on dips' strategy, which has worked well in this rally, continues to hold. However, a valuation discrepancy persists, with large-caps being fairly valued and mid and small-caps highly valued. Long-term investors should exploit this discrepancy by buying quality large-caps during declines. Technical View ""A decisive breach above 24,600 levels would once again improve the bias anticipating a further rise in the coming days to retest the previous peak zone of 24,850 levels,"" Vaishali Parekh, Vice President of Technical research at Prabhudas Lilladher. ""Sensex has closed below the 20 DMA level of 80120, and a decisive close below 79,200 will see some profit booking until the next important support zone at the 50 DMA level of 77,300, below which the trend will weaken.

TRP posted robust 14.7% YoY growth in domestic formulation (DF) segment. However, this was partly offset by floods in some provinces in Brazil and the lack of approvals in US generics segment. TRP delivered the highest gross margin in the past 20 quarters. TRP remains a promising play in the pharma space, with 64% of its revenue derived from branded generics and sustainable outperformance to industry in DF/Brazil. ANDA approvals are expected to pick up, which would not only boost revenue growth but also improve profitability of the US generics segment. Accordingly, we estimate a 32% earnings CAGR over FY24-26. Outlook We maintain our FY25 earnings estimate. We raise our FY26 earnings estimate by 3% to factor in a) the benefit of ANDA approvals, b) the addition of products in OTC segment in India, and c) the shift to the new tax regime.

The IT firm reported revenue and margin, which were far lower than analyst estimates. Additionally, the management also lowered its FY25 DET (digital, engineering and technology) revenue growth guidance sharply to flat YoY from high single digits growth, with the second half of the year expected to be better than the first. Following the earnings, Emkay Global cut its FY25E-27E earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 5-13 percent, factoring-in the Q1 miss, sharp guidance cut, and gradual recovery in DET margin. The brokerage cut target multiple to 25x (from 27x), given the sharp guidance cut within only a quarter raising concerns on growth predictability. According to analysts at Emkay, a big earnings miss will weigh on the near-term stock performance of Cyient, but valuations remain fairly undemanding. It retained a 'buy' rating on the stock but cut the target price to Rs 2,300 per share. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action Meanwhile, calling Q1 results shocking, Nuvama Institutional Equities said only reasonable valuations will save the day for Cyient. The IT firm ""now requires 3 percent-plus CQGR to achieve FY25 flat YoY revenue guidance –a tall ask in our view, given broad-based weakness. Cheap valuations limit potential downside,"" the brokerage said. The broad-based decline across verticals raises uncertainty on growth recovery path, according to analysts at Nuvama. They remain negative on Cyient, even as inexpensive valuations limit the downside potential. The brokerage maintained 'hold' rating on the stock but cut the target price to Rs 1,840 from Rs 2,120 earlier. At 11:38 am, Cyient shares were trading nearly 8.2 percent lower at Rs 1,739.25 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). Over the past year, the stock has gained 19 percent.

NWC to sales improved to 13.9% (vs 17.0% in Q1FY24) owing to better collections. Despite order prospects falling 10% YoY, management maintained guidance of ~10% order inflow growth for the year. Domestic execution was expected to slowdown in Q1 due to labour shortages during elections, and will normalize in H2 to achieve targeted revenue growth of ~15% in FY25. Continued focus on capex-led growth in the budget will sustain domestic business momentum. Meanwhile, Middle East continues to focus on investments in infrastructure, energy transition, and oil & gas. Opportunity pipeline is strong in offshore wind in Europe, rail & metro transit and oil to chemicals in Middle East, and green energy, nuclear energy and hydrogen pump storage projects in India. We believe L&T is well-placed to benefit in the long-run owing to 1) strong international prospects led by Middle East, 2) healthy domestic pipeline on the back of public-driven capex and uptick in private capex, and 3) improving profitability in development projects, and 4) penetration in newer areas such as green hydrogen, electrolyzers, semiconductors, data centers, etc. The stock is currently trading at a P/E of 30.8x/23.6x FY25/26E.

"Ramco Cements Q1 Preview: Weak prices, realisations, stiff competition pour concrete on profit hopes",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/ramco-cements-q1-preview-weak-prices-realisations-stiff-competition-pour-concrete-on-profit-hopes-12778609.html,Stocks,"July 25, 2024 09:11 PM","Ramco Cements is set to present its earnings report for the first fiscal quarter of FY25 on July 26. The cement manufacturer is expected to deliver a subpar performance in Q1FY25 with net profit and revenue declining, primarily due to weaker cement prices because of increase in intense competition and higher regional concentration lately. According to a Moneycontrol poll, Ramco Cements' net profit is expected to slump 51 percent on-year to Rs 38 crore. Revenue is seen falling around 1.3 percent YoY to Rs 2,221 crore. Even the most optimistic estimate sees Ramco Cements' net profit falling 31 percent on-year. The most pessimistic projection suggests that net profit might sink nearly 69 percent YoY.  On a sequential basis, net profit and revenue are seen falling 68 percent, and 17 percent, respectively. Also Read | DLF's net profit jumps 22.5% to Rs 646 crore in Q1FY25, revenue down 4% What factors are driving the earnings? Weak demand: The slowdown in construction activities during the general elections in April and May adversely impacted cement sales in these months. Scorching heat, labour shortages, and unseasonal rain in some regions further dented demand during Q1FY25. Muted prices: Cement prices entered Q1FY25 with a steep hike announcement in some regions, but with lower-than-historical average demand and a sudden ramp-up of M&As among large players, sustaining any price hike became impossible. Hikes implemented in April were reversed during May and June due to soft demand and stiff competition. Decline in realisations: According to analysts at Motilal Oswal, price realization is likely to decline around eight percent YoY due to weak pricing in the southern region. Price realisation in cement refers to the average revenue a company earns per unit sold. It helps gauge the average income per ton, with higher realisation indicating better profitability per unit. High Costs: The cement maker's depreciation/interest expenses are estimated to increase by 14 percent and 12 percent on-year, respectively, according to Motilal Oswal. What to look out for in the quarterly show? Analysts will closely monitor Ramco Cements' management commentary on demand conditions during this seasonally weak quarter, price sustainability amid intensifying competition, and ongoing sector consolidation.

Bajaj Finserv Health, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bajaj Finserv, in January had acquired an entire stake in Vidal Healthcare Services at an enterprise value of Rs 325 crore. The management is working on a long-term plan for Vidal Healthcare expected to be finalized within six to nine months, which will outline the path to profitability. Modi said that the company's current focus is creating a differentiated value proposition in the highly commoditized Third Party Administrator (TPA) industry. ""With the acquisition of Vidal, we can now offer hospitalization as a service,"" said Modi. The company has several services planned for customers. For example, last quarter, it launched Diabetic Care as a fully managed package which can be offered to customers by employers or insurers, he added. Q1 results Bajaj Finserv on July 24 reported a 10 percent rise in its net profit to Rs 2,138 crore in the first quarter of the current financial year.

Franchise business grew 11% YoY. Restructuring of franchise business is yielding results. Improvement of mix of big franchisee to small franchisee (added 600 large franchise YoY) is driving growth and it is likely to drive 10-15% growth in FY25E. Partnership business grew 29% YoY, barring sales from API holdings (parent) and B2G business, growth stood at 41% YoY. Normalised margin for pathology segment stood at 31.4%, down 140bps YoY (+560 bps QoQ); radiology sales grew 15.7% YoY to INR 130mn while margins stood at 10.0% down 250bps YoY (+100bps QoQ).

The newly launched bundled test package ‘Jaanch’ grew at 25% YoY. EBITDA margin expanded 140bps to 27.2% mainly driven by operating leverage and lower ESOP cost. Management expects EBITDA margin in 27-30% range in FY25. We raise FY25/26E EBITDA by 5% each and earnings by 11-12% to factor better margins. Maintain BUY with DCF-based revised TP of INR 825.

Beat was mainly due to outperformance in the aluminium segment and better-thanexpected volume growth in the lead segment. Key points: 1) Lead/plastic volumes grew 43.2%/16% YoY while aluminium volume declined 48.5% YoY. 2) EBITDA/te of lead/aluminium was INR 19,321/INR 19,414; improvement in EBITDA/te of Al is mainly on account of higher LME prices. 3) GRAV incurred capex of INR 150–200mn during Q1FY25, targeting INR 1.8bn (existing vertical of INR 1.4bn and new vertical of INR 400mn). 4 In Q1FY25, 40% of scrap sourcing was from domestic sources. 5) Lithium-ion recycling and tyre recycling projects at Mundra are likely to be operational in H1FY26. 6) Gross debt stood at INR 5.5bn and net debt at INR 4.7bn, as of Q1FY25-end. Management guides for volume growth of 25% for FY25 and sustainable EBITDA/kg of INR 14–16/kg in Al recycling and INR 18–19/kg in lead segment. Outlook Despite being in the commodities space, GRAV’s margins are likely to remain stable and relatively better compared to peers due to sourcing efficiencies and back-to-back hedging policy for lead. Going ahead, even aluminium recycling operations in domestic market (ADC-12 alloy) would be largely hedged, allowing further stability in margins. Going forward, we peg volume growth of 25% YoY and EBITDA/EPS growth of 38%/28% YoY till FY26E. Given the focus on a circular economy, relatively better margins compared to peers and high RoE, we raise our valuation multiple to 30x (earlier 21x) on FY26E EPS. We have also raised our EPS estimates by 5%/6% for FY25/FY26 owing to the lower (sustainable) depreciation at overseas subsidiaries.

Gross loan loss for the company stood at INR 17.9bn or 2.12%. However, during the quarter, Bajaj utilised management overlay to the extent of INR 1.05bn and hence loan loss (net) after adjusting for management overlay stood at 1.99%. Even after utilisation, loan loss was elevated vs 1.66% QoQ and 1.57% YoY. Muted collection efficiencies was the primary reason for inch up in credit cost as per the management. Outlook Bajaj Finance’s (Bajaj) Q1FY25 result has been largely in line except credit cost, which was higher-than-guided range. Credit cost increased to 2.12% (adjusted for management overlay utilisation stood at 1.99%) vs guidance of 1.75-1.85%. While management highlighted that incremental delinquency and collection trend in Jul’24 is better than Apr-Jun’24 and credit cost in H2FY25 should be materially lower than H1, meeting FY25 credit cost guidance will be the key thing to watch out. Strong core operating performance as reflected in consolidated AUM growth of 7% QoQ and PPoP growth of 8% QoQ, was largely driven by strong 8% QoQ revenue growth. This resulted in Bajaj sustaining industry-leading profitability with RoA at 4.6% and RoE at 20% in Q1.

Overall, EBITDA of INR 663mn (down 0.5% YoY) was 19.7%/1.7% above our/Street’s estimates. Contract logistics business’ outperformance was partially marred by the lingering softness in the B2B express business – booked EBITDA loss of INR 803mn/INR 137mn in FY24/Q1FY25. Key points: 1) Express business’ profitability continued to be impacted by the integration and network transition, higher transportation cost and lower-than-expected volume growth (likely breakeven positive by Q3FY25). 2) SCM segment’s revenue grew 10.4% YoY; gross margins were marginally better QoQ. 3) Freight-forwarding improved QoQ with an uptick in cross-border freight rates. 4) In 3PL, MLL launched a new 0.3mn sq.ft. facility in Guwahati (Assam).

This translated into RoA of 4.62% and AUM growth has been healthy at INR 269.7bn, up 52% YoY/8% QoQ. Moreover, AUM has grown at 46% CAGR over the past two years. Asset quality has also been improving with sustained decline in gross as well we net Stage-3 since the past 4–5 quarters. Poonawalla continues to see steady growth in AUM and profitability coupled with superior asset quality metrics. Arvind Kapil has taken over the reigns as MD&CEO during the quarter. Outlook Poonawalla Fincorp’s (Poonawalla) new MD & CEO – Arvind Kapil – revealed that its guiding philosophy across businesses would be productivity, predictability and sustainability. This would be achieved via higher investments initially in collection infra, tech and launch of new products. These investments would be made with a long-term horizon and an aspiration of scaling AUM by 5–6x over the next 5–6 years. We believe RoA shall remain in the range of 3.5% - 4% over the next two years due to higher investments in the initial phase and normalisation of credit cost. We resume coverage with HOLD rating and a TP of INR 390, valuing the stock at 3.0x FY26E P/B (vs. 5-year average of 2.2x). A favourable blend of high growth aspiration and the current MD’s track record at HDFC Bank justifies the premium multiple, in our view, which, in turn, instils confidence on execution and Poonawalla’s ability to deliver steady/sustainable return ratios.

Stocks like Va Tech Wabag, Ion Exchange, Welspun Enterprises, WPIL and EMS Limited are suddenly being talked about in the analyst and investor community and have also been gaining steady ground in an otherwise weak market. While presenting the budget on July 23, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the Centre will be working in partnership with the state governments and Multilateral Development Banks to promote water supply, sewage treatment and solid waste management projects and services for 100 large cities through bankable projects. More importantly, the Finance Minister announced a budgetary allocation of Rs 69,926.65 crore for the Jal Jeevan Mission, up from around Rs 69,846.31 crore in 2023-2024. This is the government's flagship mission that aims to provide “functional water connections” to every rural household. Further, the Department of Sanitation and Water Treatment has received a budgetary allocation of Rs 77,390 crore against Rs 77,032.65 crore in the previous budget (FY23-24). Also read: Why this water treatment stock merits attention, post Budget “This sector continues to remain under focus as it addresses the basic need for water availability, which the government needs to fulfil,” notes SBI Cap Securities' Sunny Agrawal in a latest report, adding that the schemes will continue to be a priority for the next 3-4 years, as the agenda is still a work in progress. Analysts further believe that the investment opportunity in India's water and wastewater sector is substantial, with an estimated market size of approximately Rs 25,000-30,000 crore per annum, split roughly 40:60 between water and wastewater. “Currently, only about 40 percent of sewage is treated, and many cities lack adequate sewerage networks and water supply. India still has a long way to go in enhancing its water infrastructure,” says Arvind Kothari, smallcase Manager & Founder of Niveshaay. The market is expected to grow by 12-15 percent over the next 4-5 years, according to research done by Niveshaay Investment Advisory. They expect to see investments of around Rs 50,000-60,000 crore in the space through government schemes over the next three years. “Many companies and sectors will benefit, including those involved in pipe structures, structural tube pipes, and large and small diameter pipes as well as water treatment companies. These companies have strong order books in water treatment or sewage treatment,” says Agrawal. Here are some of the key players in the segment to keep watch out for.

Valuations Regarding valuations in this segment, they are not very expensive, though slightly higher compared to other construction sectors due to strong profit and revenue growth visibility, Agrawal notes. Abhinav Kapadia, Research Analyst- Institutional Equities at Asit C. Mehta Investment Interrmediates concurs, “The sector has seen a significant rally. Valuations are a bit stretched at this point of time. Having said that, if growth is higher than our expectations, companies may see an up move.” Currently analysts do not see many headwinds for the sector except for slow execution. “In the past, several significant water projects have stalled due to delays in receiving payments from government authorities. However, this issue has been largely addressed for projects funded by multilateral agencies such as the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank,” says Kothari.

At close, the Sensex was down 109.08 points or 0.14 percent at 80,039.80, and the Nifty was down 7.40 points or 0.03 percent at 24,406.10. The Nifty index recovered 195 points from day's low, while BSE Sensex saw recovery of 560 points from day's low. On the back of weak global cues, the Indian indices opened on a negative note and extended the losses as the day progressed, but buying at lower levels helped recovery from the day’s low and closed with marginal losses. Top Nifty gainers included Tata Motors, ONGC, SBI Life Insurance, BPCL and Sun Pharma, while Axis Bank, Nestle India, Titan Company, ICICI Bank and Tata Steel were the losers. On the sectoral front, auto, capital goods, power, oil & gas, healthcare, media rose 0.5-3 percent, while bank, IT, metal, realty and telecom shed 0.5-1 percent. The BSE midcap and smallcap indices ended marginally lower.

Click to View Full List Outlook for July 26 Aditya Gaggar Director of Progressive Shares Following weak global equities, Indian markets started the monthly expiry day on a tepid note with a loss of over 150 points. But, after a sharp cut, one-way recovery was seen throughout the day which supported the Index limiting its losses to 7.40 points to end the session at 24,406.10. Among the sectors, auto was the biggest gainer followed by energy while metal and realty corrected the most. Mid and Smallcaps recovered from their morning lows but underperformed the Benchmark Index. As we are constantly mentioning that the level of 24,200 is a strong support and as long as the Index holds it, the uptrend will remain intact. On the flip side, a level of 24,560 is considered an immediate hurdle. Jatin Gedia – Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas Nifty opened gap down however it witnessed a pullback and closed off the intraday lows though marginally in the red down ~7 points. On the daily charts we can observe that after opening gap down it did not witness follow through selling pressure and staged a pullback. We believe that the Index is undergoing a counter trend pullback which can extend towards 24500 – 24550 which coincides with the 61.82% Fibonacci retracement level of the fall. The daily momentum indicator has a negative crossover and thus this rally is likely to fizzle out. Ideally this rally should be sold into. Bank Nifty has been leading this fall. Today it achieved our short-term target of 50600 and thereafter consolidated. Considering it has reached a crucial support the fall from hereon may be less intense and can witness a consolidation in the near term. In terms of levels, 50600 – 50400 is a crucial support zone while 51300 – 51600 is the immediate hurdle zone for the Bank Nifty.

Suzlon Energy | CMP: Rs 62.01 | The stock gained over 2 percent, extending gains for a fourth straight session to hit multi-year high on July 25.

KPIT Technologies | CMP: Rs 1,789.90  | The stock fell 3.5 percent as brokerages remained divided after its quarterly earnings. Some analysts are positive on the stock and suggest the stock may reach Rs 2,100 level on the back of a healthy order book, while others suggest that the counter may fall up to 40 percent on the back of rich valuations.  RBL Bank | CMP: Rs 230.65 | Shares fell 3 percent after a 7.95 percent stake was sold through a block deal. The transaction, worth Rs 1,100 crore, likely saw private equity firm EQT (formerly Baring PE Asia) exit the lender.Around 4.8 crore shares of RBL Bank changed hands at an average price of Rs 229.50, implying an 3.5 percent discount to the previous closing price of the stock.  Axis Bank | CMP: Rs 1,176.25 | Shares took a 5 percent dive after the lender reported its April-June earnings which highlighted its worsening asset quality. The lender reported a sharp spike in its net profit, which came at Rs 6,035 crore for Q1 FY25, up from Rs 3,452 crore in the year ago period.

Larsen & Toubro | CMP: Rs 3,622 | Shares rose 3 percent after brokerages either retained bullish calls on Larsen & Toubro (L&T) or raised target prices on the stock after the company's fiscal first quarter earnings (Q1FY25) beat Street estimates, albeit marginally. According to analysts, L&T has a dominant position and market share in most operating verticals which imparts flexibility to cherry-pick projects, which helps optimise overall business profitability.

Gold loan stocks to feel the pinch from duty cut as margin of safety shrinks: Analysts,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gold-loan-stocks-to-feel-the-pinch-from-duty-cut-as-margin-of-safety-shrinks-analysts-12778320.html,Stocks,"July 25, 2024 03:43 PM","While jewellery stocks danced on reduced customs duty on gold to 6 percent from 15 percent, but shares of top gold loan issuers Manappuram Finance, Muthoot Finance - took a hit, plunging over 5 percent each after the Budget announcement. Analysts believe that this reduction in gold duties could lead to lower gold prices, which could negatively impact gold loan companies in the near term by diminishing their financial cushion or 'margin of safety.' Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities explained that if gold prices start to decline, gold financing companies might experience a reduction in their loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, making them less financially secure. A lower LTV ratio means that the value of the gold used to secure loans is less compared to the total loans issued, thus reducing the companies' margin of safety. ALSO READ: Mild overweight on equities; bullish on Indian government bonds: the post-Budget view Jasani also highlighted that fewer people and businesses might take out new loans backed by gold since the value of the gold collateral would be lower. He advised investors to consider taking profits from related stocks given these potential impacts. Analysts at InCred Equities shared similar concerns, noting that a decline in gold prices could lead to irregular repayments by borrowers if the value of their gold collateral falls below the loan amount. Despite these concerns about LTV ratios, analysts at SBI Funds Management believe that gold financiers will navigate these challenges effectively in the medium term. They noted that the LTV ratios for gold financiers are in the low 60s and do not expect significant asset quality issues. Muthoot, Manappuram Finance glitters on rising gold prices Over the past five years, rising gold prices have significantly benefited Muthoot Finance and Manappuram Finance. Gold prices have nearly doubled to Rs 68,918 per 10 gram from Rs 34,943 per 10 gram, leading to increased lending by gold financiers and boosting gold loan assets under management (AUM) in recent quarters. Muthoot Finance's gold loans grew at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16 percent in 5 years, driven largely by a 14 percent CAGR in gold prices. In contrast, Manappuram Finance's gold loan portfolio expanded at modest 11 percent CAGR during the same period. ALSO READ: 21 Budget stocks that may benefit from FM Nirmala Sitharaman's announcements As gold loans account for 96 percent of Muthoot Finance's standalone assets under management (AUM), compared to 51 percent of Manappuram Finance's consolidated AUM, it indicates that Muthoot Finance's loan book is more heavily reliant on gold price fluctuations. In contrast, Manappuram Finance's AUM is more diversified, including micro-financial institutions (26 percent of AUM), vehicle loans (10 percent of AUM), and home loans (4 percent of AUM) in addition to gold financing. The way ahead Looking ahead, market participants will closely monitor gold's performance in dollar terms, as it will influence local gold prices. Independent market expert Ambareesh Baliga believes that the recent fall in gold prices due to the government’s move is already reflected in the market, and future trends will be driven by other market forces. Similarly, Gaurang Shah, Senior Vice-President at Geojit Financial Services, expects that the festive season and monsoon activity will impact gold prices and, consequently, the performance of gold financiers. Shah noted that, as global gold prices have not decreased significantly, a rebound in domestic gold prices is anticipated now that the domestic event is out of the way.

According to Bloomberg estimates, Power Grid is expected to report around 8.4 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase in revenue at Rs 11,978 crore in Q1FY25 over Rs 11,048.1 crore in Q1FY24. Net profit is also expected to grow to Rs 4,028.2 crore in the quarter ending June 2024 compared to Rs 3,382.8 crore in the quarter ending June 2023. Currently, around 13 brokerages have buy calls on the stock and eight have sell calls. PGCIL is a central public sector undertaking (CPSU) under the ministry of power dealing in power transmission as well as telecom and consultancy. The stock has gained around 183 percent over the last five years and around 78.9 percent over the last one year. What are the factors impacting the earnings? Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities expect the company to report a modest revenue growth (7.7 percent YoY) due to asset capitalisation of Rs 7,600 crore in the trailing 12 months, while they expect them to report a healthy growth in PAT (11 percent YoY). EBITDA margin is expected to grow 2 basis points YoY from 87 percent in June 2023 to 87.2 percent in June 2024. Here are some of the factors that analysts expect will impact the earnings. Growth in capex – The company has set a capex target of Rs 15,000 crore in FY25, 20 percent higher than the FY24 capex of Rs 12,500 crore, say Elara Capital analysts. Capitalisation is likely to double in the range of Rs 1,50,000 – 1,60,000 crore in FY25. Power demand - Power generation across the sector grew 11 percent YoY growth to 490BU in Q1FY25 due to severe heatwaves with peak demand at 250GW in May, up 13 percent YoY, say broking firms. Growth of telecom and consultancy segment: Analysts see improved PAT as a result of increased contributions from the telecom and consultancy segment. In Q4, the telecom segment saw 11.8 percent YoY increase in revenue contribution to Rs 2,49,700 crore from Rs  2,08,800 crore in Q4FY23. Sustained growth in projects: Analysts at Elara Securities note that the quantum of work-in-hand projects rose to Rs 86,700 crore that includes ongoing regulated projects worth Rs 11,200 crore, new regulated projects at Rs 24,700 crore and other projects at Rs 508 crore. What to look for in the results?Analysts will be watching out on continued growth in capex and order realisations. Absence of new order or reduced orders due to challenges from the tariff-based competitive bidding route could be a concern. In Q4, the company, according to a May 2024 JM Financial report, had highlighted an estimated Rs 17,000 crore outlay in other businesses such as solar generation, smart metering and data center over the next 7-8 years. With continued government push for these segments, analysts will be awaiting announcements on the same.

The stock has been seeing a sharp rally since it reported stellar earnings earlier this week for the quarter ended June 2024. In the last five days, Suzlon has rallied around 14 percent compared to a 1.5 percent decline in benchmark Nifty, with some analysts seeing up to 18 further upside. After the renewable energy firm reported a 200 percent surge in net profit for the fiscal first quarter at Rs 302 crore and 50 percent surge in revenue from operations to Rs 1,348 crore, several brokerages have retained their bullish calls on Suzlon Energy and even raised price targets. In the FY24–26E period, Geojit Financial Services expects Suzlon’s revenue CAGR & ROE to surpass those of the industry peers. ""We anticipate order inflows to be strong in this period, supported by strong government tendering and from commercial and industrial (C&I) customers,"" it said. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action Despite factoring in the risks in execution numbers, analysts at Geojit expect the revenue CAGR of 53 percent to drive the EPS growth of 66 percent CAGR, resulting in ROE improvement from 18.2 percent in FY24A to 26.9 percent in FY26E. Improved executions, cost optimization from better work-force management, & better pass-through of commodity prices are expected to enable Wind turbine generators (WTG margin) improvement. ""Suzlon 2.0 is a de-levered, optimised, profit making business which has done away with its troubled past and is looking at a vibrant landscape of opportunities in India and abroad,"" said Geojit as it maintained a 'Buy' on the stock with a target price of Rs 73. JM Financial too has reiterated its 'Buy' rating in Suzlon and raised the target price to Rs 71 from Rs 54 earlier. ""We believe that gradual building of momentum for higher execution, healthy order book, more healthy bid pipeline, strengthening of balance sheet and the organization are driving the company for the next-level of growth,"" JM Financial said. Nuvama Institutional Equities, meanwhile, has downgraded the wind energy firm's stock, and while it stays long-term positive on Suzlon Energy, it said that the uptick in order inflows and profits is already factored in, as the stock now trades at 40 times estimated FY27 earnings per share (EPS) of wind turbine generator (WTG) business. ""We remain long-term positive on the sector and Suzlon Energy; however, the expected uptick in order inflow from H2FY25 seems to be already baked in the current market price,"" Nuvama said as it suggested a target price of Rs 64 on the stock. According to analysts at Nuvama, Suzlon Energy is best-placed to capture demand with industry-leading EPC capacity (2GW yearly) and an optionality of repowering along with C&I demand, over and above 8–10GW of auctions. Also Read | Suzlon Energy Q1 Net Sales at Rs 2,021.59 crore, up 50% YoY However, it faces several risks that could impact its performance. Delays in the execution ramp-up of projects and a shortage of high Plant Load Factor (PLF) sites could hinder growth. Additionally, issues such as renewables curtailment, inadequate transmission evacuation, and delays in the auction of renewable projects pose challenges. Increased competitive intensity and a rising market share of Independent Power Producers (IPPs) further complicate the landscape. The discontinuation of the Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) waiver adds to the uncertainty. At 12:34 pm, Suzlon shares were trading nearly 3 percent higher at Rs 62.18 on NSE.

This change is expected to lead to an increase in tax outflow for real estate investment gains, depending on the sale price and inflation, according to Bernstein. To mitigate this increased tax burden, investors have two primary options: reinvest the capital from the asset sale into another real estate property or invest in special government 54 EC bonds. The 54 EC bonds, which can only be issued by specific government-backed entities such as Power Finance Corporation (PFC), REC Ltd, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), and Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC), currently offer a coupon rate of 5.25 percent with a five-year duration. This rate is lower compared to the average cost of funds for PFC at 7.4 percent and REC at 7.1 percent. If demand for these bonds rises, it could potentially lower borrowing costs for these two lenders, thereby improving their spreads and return on equity (ROE), Bernstein said. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action The international brokerage had initiated coverage on both PFC and REC stocks with an 'outperform' rating and target prices of Rs 653 and Rs 620 respectively. It views both of these stocks as leveraged power sector plays, despite the associated risks. In its note, Bernstein highlighted that REC and PFC, long overlooked by investors, now boast market capitalisations between $15 billion and $20 billion, with trading volumes nearing $125 million. Despite this, both stocks trade at relatively low trailing price-to-earnings ratios of 8 to 10 times, it said, adding that three types of investors think about these two stocks: those who are enthusiastic about REC and PFC, those who question their relevance, and those who are unaware of these stocks. At 12:00 noon on July 25, REC and PFC shares were trading marginally higher at Rs 606.80 and Rs 525.15 apiece, respectively, on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

"Axis Bank stock drops 6% as Q1 asset quality takes a hit, credit costs rise",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/axis-bank-stock-drops-6-as-q1-asset-quality-takes-a-hit-credit-costs-rise-12777715.html,Stocks,"July 25, 2024 10:40 AM","Axis Bank shares took a 6 percent dive on July 25, a day after the lender reported its April-June earnings which highlighted its worsening asset quality that soured investor sentiment. The lender reported a sharp spike in its net profit, which came at Rs 6,035 crore for Q1 FY25, up from Rs 3,452 crore in the year ago period. Even though this net profit came in well above the Street's estimate of Rs 5,797 crore, it was the rise in non-performing assets that worried investors. Sequentially, the lender's gross non-performing assets rose 11 basis points to 1.54 percent in Q1 while net non-performing assets were up 3 basis points to 0.34 percent. Puneet Sharma, the chief financial officer of the company, in a post results press call, stated that this pressure on asset quality was due to seasonality on the retail agri business in the first quarter. Follow our live blog for all the updates Meanwhile, the lender's net credit cost stood at 0.97 percent in Q1FY25, up 47 bps year-on-year (YoY). Credit costs refer to expenses incurred by a lender due to default or potential default on loans. The management indicated that roughly 55 percent of the increase in credit costs was due to lower recoveries and upgrades in the corporate loan portfolio. Although they expect these recoveries to eventually take place, the timing could shift between one and two quarters. ""We need to factor in that seasonality played a spoilsport for sequential rise in non-performing assets (NPAs) and expect credit costs to go higher amid lower pace of recoveries,"" Axis Bank stated during its earnings conference call. Bogged down by the double whammy of worsening asset quality and rising credit costs, at 09.44 am, shares of Axis Bank were trading at Rs 1,168.45 on the NSE, emerging as the biggest laggard on the Nifty 50 list.

RVNL stock falls despite bagging LoA for Rs 191-cr project from South Eastern Railway,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/rvnl-stock-falls-despite-bagging-loa-for-rs-191-cr-project-from-south-eastern-railway-12777673.html,Stocks,"July 25, 2024 10:31 AM","RVNL shares fell around half a percent on July 25 despite the company receiving a Letter of Acceptance (LoA) for a project worth Rs 191.53 crore from South Eastern Railway. The LoA is for “Design, Supply, Erection, Testing & Commissioning of 132 KV Traction Substation, Sectioning post (SPs), and Sub sectioning post (SSPs) in 2x25KV System on Rajkhaswan- Nayagarh-Bolani section of Chakradharpur division of South Eastern Railway to meet 3000MT loading target on EPC mode"", the company said in a regulatory filing. It is worth noting that RVNL was among the multibagger railway stocks that experienced a sharp decline following Union Budget 2024 as there was limited focus on the sector. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action Investors had expected substantial funding for railways, but Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's budget speech hardly addressed the railway sector, leading to significant decline in stock prices of RVNL, Ircon International, IRFC, RailTel, and others. According to analysts at Elara Capital, even though capital expenditure (Capex) was retained, the initial euphoria in sectors such as Aerospace & Defense, Railways, Infrastructure, and Shipbuilding is expected to temper as focus shifts from enthusiasm to execution. RVNL stock ended marginally higher at Rs 592.50 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in the previous session. The stock has soared over 220 percent so far this year and over 357 percent in the last one year as RVNL’s fundamentals continued improving. Its profitability has grown significantly as its profit after tax rose from Rs 790 crore in FY19 to over Rs 1,640 crore in FY24 due to bagging huge infrastructure orders from the government. Additionally, the company has continued to attract more infrastructure deals in India and other countries.

However, it faces risks including project execution delays, reliance on government contracts, regulatory changes, economic slowdowns, funding challenges, increased competition, and cost overruns, all of which could negatively impact its profitability. Bloomberg data shows that the stock has a 'hold' rating from three analysts and zero buy or sell calls.

According to analysts, L&T has a dominant position and market share in most operating verticals which imparts flexibility to cherry-pick projects, which helps optimise overall business profitability. Larsen and Toubro's consolidated net profit for the quarter ended June 2024 jumped 12 percent on-year to Rs 2,786 crore, and its revenue from operations rose 15 percent YoY to Rs 55,120 crore. International brokerage Citi has maintained a 'Buy' rating on L&T with a target price of Rs 4,396, highlighting its strong positioning to benefit from growth in capex in India and the Middle East. L&T continues to be Citi's top pick in the sector. Emkay Global has maintained its 'buy' rating on L&T, albeit lowering the target price to Rs 4,100 from Rs 4,200 per share earlier due to an earnings cut in FY26-27E on account of lower other income estimates. According to the brokerage, while the capital goods major's Q1 performance surprised positively, muted execution was seen in the domestic market mainly due to heat-waves and general elections during the quarter. However, execution is likely to see pick-up in the second half of the year. While the management guided lower order prospects (both YoY and sequentially, especially in Hydrocarbon) at Rs 9.1 lakh crore, FY25 guidance on order inflow, revenue and margin has been maintained. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action The management pointed to labor availability challenges across markets which should improve gradually.

Axis Bank expects credit costs to go higher after Q1 asset quality declines,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/axis-bank-expects-credit-costs-to-go-higher-after-q1-asset-quality-declines-12777413.html,Stocks,"July 24, 2024 08:36 PM","Following a decline in asset quality during the June-ended quarter, Axis Bank forecasts a continued increase in credit costs, primarily due to a slower pace of recoveries, which is expected to exert further pressure on the bank's financial outlook. ""We need to factor in that seasonality played a spoilsport for sequential rise in non-performing assets (NPAs) and expect credit costs to go higher amid lower pace of recoveries,"" Axis Bank stated during their earnings conference call. The private lender reported a gross NPA ratio of 1.54 percent for the quarter ended June, an 11 basis point increase quarter-on-quarter (QoQ). Similarly, the net NPA ratio increased by 3 bps QoQ to 0.34 percent in Q1FY25 amid rising credit costs. The net credit cost stood at 0.97 percent in Q1FY25, up 47 bps year-on-year (YoY). Credit costs refer to expenses incurred by a lender due to default or potential default on loans. ALSO READ: Axis Bank Q1 results: April-June net profit rises to Rs 6,035 crore The management indicated that roughly 55 percent of the increase in credit costs was due to lower recoveries and upgrades in the corporate loan portfolio. Although they expect these recoveries to eventually take place, the timing could shift between one and two quarters. ""Yes, there is deterioration seen in our asset quality across parts of the book, but it is not concerning enough because it has not breached our risk thresholds,"" the management assured. Axis Bank also reported a muted increase in net profit in Q1FY24 due to a substantial rise in loan loss provisions. The private sector lender’s net profit rose 4 percent YoY to Rs 6,035 crore in Q1FY25, while net interest income increased by 12 percent YoY to Rs 13,448 crore. The net interest margin (NIM), a measure of profitability for banks, stood at 4.05 percent, down 1 bps sequentially, and 5 bps from the year-ago period. Looking ahead, the management indicated that they aim to maintain margins at 3.8 percent on a two-cycle basis. ""We will make all efforts to ensure we retain as much of the margin as we possibly can. But we are watchful of the competitive intensity in the market space for deposits as we get into the rest of the fiscal year,"" they added.

A Budget proposal that could help Sebi address SME IPO concerns,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/a-budget-proposal-that-could-help-sebi-address-sme-ipo-concerns-12777327.html,Stocks,"July 24, 2024 05:42 PM","The government’s decision to lower the long-term capital gains tax rate for transfer of unlisted shares is likely to help address a growing concern in the SME IPO space, which is already high on the regulatory radar due to frequent instances of unusually high level of subscription and listing gains. While presenting the Union Budget on July 23, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that LTCG tax on unlisted shares will be reduced to 12.5 percent. Earlier, it was taxed at 20 percent with indexation benefit. “… the amount of income-tax calculated on such long-term capital gains (for unlisted securities)… at the rate of twenty percent for any transfer which takes place before the 23rd day of July, 2024; and at the rate of twelve and one-half percent for any transfer which takes place on or after the 23rd day of July, 2024,” stated the Finance Bill 2024. This assumes significance as this has done away with the spread that existed earlier in terms of the LTCG tax rates for listed and unlisted securities. For listed shares, it was 10 percent prior to the budget, which was hiked to 12.5 percent. Simply put, the LTCG tax rate now for listed and unlisted shares is same at 12.5 percent. Market participants say this would lead to many promoters of SMEs raising funds by diluting stakes in the private market as there would be no real tax incentive of doing that on the exchange platform. Also Read: SME IPOs continue to pour amidst regulatory concerns Doing a stake sale through an IPO also entails compliance and regulatory costs and those can be avoided as well when doing a private sale, they add. “This will give fillip to stake sales in the private space especially in the SME segment as the tax benefit spread is no more there plus such stake sales will be much easier and quicker to execute,” says Bhavin Shah, Partner, Private Equity Leader, PWC. This would be welcome news to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), which has been highlighting its concerns around the SME IPO segment, which was launched way back in 2012. “We do see signs of manipulation in the SME (small and medium enterprises) segment… We are able to see certain patterns. However, as per our regulation, the way that we need to construct the entire case, we do need to take some time to do that in a robust manner,” SEBI chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch had said in March. Also Read: 'We see signs of manipulation in the SME segment,' says SEBI chairperson Recently, the National Stock Exchange (NSE) also tightened the norms for the segment, while putting a 90 percent cap on the stock price movement on the day of listing. There have been nearly 22 SME IPOs this year that saw their respective share prices more than double on the day of listing itself. Market participants further believe that such a move was warranted as the current calendar year has also seen many SME IPOs that were subscribed in multiple of hundred times. The IPO of HOAC Foods India and Magenta Lifecare was subscribed 1963 times and 1003 times, respectively. Further, there were another 35 SME IPOs that were subscribed between 200 and 800 times each. Meanwhile, the current calendar year has already seen as nearly 120 SME IPOs till June with a cumulative fund raising of Rs 3,644 crore. This assumes significance as 2023 saw a record number of 182 SME IPOs getting launched with the total fund raising pegged at an all-time high of Rs 4,686.11 crore.

Capital gains tax hike: Déjà Vu of 2018 market trends?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/capital-gains-tax-hike-deja-vu-of-2018-market-trends-12777274.html,Stocks,"July 24, 2024 05:34 PM","When Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had introduced a 10 percent long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) in the 2018 Budget, markets dipped slightly on February 1, with the Sensex and Nifty each falling by about 0.1 percent. A week later, the indices dropped around 4 percent, with sectoral indices like Nifty Bank, Realty, and Energy declining 5.2 percent each, and Nifty MidCap 100 and SmallCap 100 losing 4.8 percent each. A month after the budget, the Sensex and Nifty fell over five percent. Nifty Bank dropped nine percent, while MidCap and SmallCap indices fell 6.1 percent  and 5.4 percent, respectively. With the 2024 Budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has proposed raising the LTCG tax on all financial assets, including equities, to 12.5 percent from 10 percent, and increasing short-term capital gains tax from 15 percent to 20 percent. Following the announcement, both the Sensex and Nifty fell by 0.1 percent each. Could we see a repeat of the 2018 pattern?  Many analysts disagree on whether the current tax changes will lead to a repeat of the 2018 market pattern. According to Neelkanth Mishra, Chief Economist at Axis Bank, the new tax framework aims to stabilize savings and won't significantly deter investors. He told Moneycontrol that even Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) won't be majorly affected, as attractive returns over the next three to five years will outweigh a minor reduction in returns. Although there was a temporary FII sell-off following the announcement, Mishra believes it won't have a lasting impact. The adjustments to capital gains tax aim to reduce distortions caused by varying tax rates across different asset classes. Rajesh Palvia, an analyst at Axis Securities, said market dynamics have changed since 2018. Back then, options had only monthly expiries, leading to higher premiums and a greater cost impact due to STT on premiums. Now, with weekly expiries, premiums are about one-fourth of what they were, reducing the impact of STT. Although profitability is lower with weekly expiries, the overall dynamics have shifted. Palvia doesn't expect the same market reaction as in 2018 solely due to capital gains tax changes. While LTCG and STCG could cause market corrections, STT won't have as much impact. Volumes may dry up when STT is applied in October, but if the market remains bullish, volumes could pick up again. Several analysts highlight that the highly anticipated post-election budget has passed. India remains one of the world's fastest-growing economies, with strong macroeconomic indicators, easing inflation, favorable monsoons, and robust growth. The government's fiscal discipline will encourage private investment. Emphasizing private capital expenditure (capex), the capex cycle stands to benefit from deleveraged corporate balance sheets, healthy profitability, rising domestic demand, and increasing capacity utilization. Although capex expenditure is unchanged from the interim budget, it shows a healthy 17 percent year-over-year growth. Tax benefits for the salaried class, focus on employment generation, and ongoing policies for housing and rural reforms (agriculture/allied sectors) are likely to positively impact consumption. Companies experiencing growth are now seeing high multiples, while those with low multiples have not yet delivered growth. Thus, short-term returns may be muted, but the long-term growth potential of the Indian equity market remains positive, analysts added. Gaurav Dua, SVP and Head of Capital Market Strategy at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, stated that Nifty is expected to remain stable without any sharp declines, though a 3-4 percent correction is possible annually. He noted that the risk-reward ratio for small-cap, mid-cap, and micro-cap stocks has become unfavorable, posing higher risks. Over the next 12 to 18 months, lagging sectors like IT services, pharma, services, and select stocks in consumer and specialty chemicals are expected to lead and outperform the index.

STT on F&O: Breaking down cost impact per contract on Index futures and options,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/stt-on-fo-breaking-down-cost-impact-per-contract-on-index-options-12777234.html,Stocks,"July 24, 2024 05:19 PM","The Budget proposal to hike securities transaction tax on derivatives trades has got market participants worked up. The consternation is understandable, as STT has to be paid irrespective of whether the trade results in a profit or loss. A higher STT means the breakeven threshold for a derivatives trade has increased. STT on the sale of an option in securities has been raised from 0.0625 percent to 0.1 percent of the option premium, and on the sale of futures in securities from 0.0125 percent to 0.02 percent of the price at which such futures are traded. We decode the cost impact of this rise in STT on index futures and some Nifty 50 stock index options. Calculations show that the STT on the sale of one lot of Nifty Futures is approximately Rs 77 at the old rates. With the revised STT, this would be Rs 123, an increase of Rs 46. For Bank Nifty futures, the net increase in cost impact is Rs 57. Futures of the Sensex, Finnifty, and Midcap Nifty indexes, which had approximate STT costs of Rs 100, 72, and 77 per lot on sale, will now have new STT charges of Rs 160, 115, and 123, respectively. Also read: Hike in STT on F&O trades a dampener, impact to be felt with a lag, say traders The table below shows the new STT charges across index and Nifty 50 stock futures and the potential cost impact:   Sheersham Gupta, Director and senior technical analyst at Rupeezy says the hike will have varying effects on these trades. ""Notably, the sale of futures contracts will experience a significant increase in STT, with an average rise of Rs 40-60 for index and stock futures. This could shift trader behaviour towards more positional trading and reduce intraday and scalping activities,” he said. “In contrast, the STT hike has a minimal impact on options trading since it is levied on the option premium, making it less likely to deter options traders,” he added. Gupta, however, notes that the overall impact on market liquidity remains to be seen once the revised STT kicks in from October 1. The regulatory measure comes into effect after SEBI's study showed a growing loss of wealth among retail participants in F&O trading.

On July 24, Sensex closed 280 points or 0.4 percent lower at 80,148 and the Nifty 50 was down 65 points or 0.3 percent at 24,413. About 2,481 shares advanced, 926 shares declined, and 82 shares remained unchanged. Most experts view the overall budget as encouraging with an emphasis on rural consumption.

Key energy sector players like Reliance Industries, NTPC, Coal India, ONGC, and Power Grid drove these gains.

It is a real-time market index representing the market's expectations for volatility over the coming 30 days. ""Profit-taking continued as investors cut their position in banking and automobile stocks, which led to a fall in key benchmark indices. However, markets ended off their lows on selective buying support although concerns of higher valuations continue to weigh,"" said Prathamesh Tapse of Mehta Equities. Top Nifty losers were Bajaj Finserv, Britannia Industries, Bajaj Finance, Tata Consumer, and Axis Bank, while gainers included HDFC Life, Tech Mahindra, BPCL, NTPC, and Tata Motors. ""Sector-wise, the trend was mixed, with energy, realty, and pharma showing decent gains, while banking and FMCG sectors declined. Notably, the broader indices performed well amid volatility, gaining between 1 percent and 2 percent,"" said Ajit Mishra, senior vice president of research at Religare Broking. ""Nifty has remained firmly above the 20-day exponential moving average (DEMA) during this consolidation, indicating that the bulls are maintaining their grip despite weakness in the banking sector,"" he added.

Despite a muted demand environment, 1QFY25 saw healthy order bookings in the 3PL and cross-border businesses. The cross-border business gained traction led by higher demand for inbound ocean cargo. The mobility, last mile delivery, and auto outbound logistics businesses also delivered strong performance. However, earnings were hit by extended start-up costs and higher manpower & warehousing lease expenses. Outlook While MLL’s performance was in line, the express business struggled with lower tonnage. MLL is hopeful of better volumes from 2QFY25. We increase our APAT estimates for FY25 by 6% considering pickup in express business volumes from 2Q. For FY26, we increase our APAT estimates by 14% to incorporate the improved outlook in the express logistics business. We estimate a 20%/35% CAGR in revenue/ EBITDA over FY24-26.

NII grew 25% YOY to ~INR83.6b (in line). Non-interest income stood at ~INR20.5b (+21% QoQ and +22% YoY) due to the resumption of EMI card sourcing and one-off recovery from written-off pool of loans of INR450m. BAF’s 1QFY25 NIM contracted ~23bp QoQ to ~9.8%. Out of this, ~13bp was on account of rise in CoF and ~10bp due to change in AUM composition. AUM growth in 1Q was supported by mortgages, commercial (ex LAS), SME, and new product segments such as cars and LAP. Higher growth in the secured product segments will likely keep yields under pressure in the near term. The management guided that the change in the AUM mix is expected to stabilize by Oct’24, which will result in stable NIMs. We estimate NIM of 9.9%/10% in FY25/FY26. Outlook Despite a healthy PAT CAGR of ~24% over FY24-FY26E and RoA/RoE of 4.2%/22% in FY26E, we see limited upside catalysts.

"Realty stocks see sharp rebound a day after Budget-led selloff, surge up to 8%",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/realty-stocks-see-sharp-rebound-a-day-after-budget-led-selloff-surge-up-to-8-12776737.html,Stocks,"July 24, 2024 02:29 PM","Shares of realty companies staged a sharp rebound on July 24, surging up to 8 percent intraday, just a day after these counters registered decline following finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman's proposal to remove the indexation benefit on calculating long term capital gains tax (LTCG) on real estate. Shares of Macrotech Developers were up 1.1 percent, Sobha up 3.1 percent, Prestige Estates up 5.4 percent, Ajmera Realty up 2.8 percent, DLF up 2 percent and Oberoi Realty up 3.4 percent. The indexation benefit adjusts the asset’s purchase price for inflation. At the time of sale, this results in a higher purchase price and a lower capital gain, potentially reducing the tax liability or even eliminating it. Without indexation, the gain is calculated on the actual purchase price, likely leading to higher taxes. Following the proposal, realty stocks witnessed strong selling on July 23, with major names like Godrej Properties and Prestige Estates slumping as much as 5 percent intraday. However, to ease the increased tax burden and rationalise the capital gains tax regime, the finance minister also changed the LTCG tax rate to 12.5 percent across all financial and non-financial assets. This would result in the LTCG tax on property falling from 20 percent earlier. Follow our live blog for all the updates Market and industry participants still remain skeptical of the proposal while some like S Naren, CIO of ICICI Prudential, welcome the decision. ""Government steps to aid asset allocation like removal of indexation should increase transaction volumes,"" Naren said in an interaction with CNBC-TV18. On the other hand, analysts at CLSA's suggest that the change will affect short-term investments with market price growth of less than 10 percent. ""However, for investments held for over ten years with property price appreciation exceeding 10 percent per annum, the impact of the new regime would be neutral or slightly beneficial,"" CLSA added. Analysts at CLSA also highlighted that markets like Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Pune, which are driven by end-users, will be the least impacted. In contrast, markets like NCR and Mumbai, with higher investor activity, are likely to be adversely affected.

Average transaction value (ATV) grew 5% (to INR 4,890) with premium brands ontribution rising to 57% vs. 54% (YoY) and item per ticket (IPT) increasing 2%. Revenue from private label (12% contribution) stood flat while from beauty segment (17% contribution) grew 5% YoY. In the beauty segment, fragrance outperformed with 19% YoY sales growth (17% revenue share). In private label, overall contribution is at 12% with apparels 18% (1.1% lower on account of brands discontinuation and space rationalisation) driven by improved full price sell through for SS24. Revenue contribution from the loyalty program (First Citizen) stands at 80% of sales (67% repeat/13% new members). Added 2 department and 9 INTUNE stores. Outlook Shoppers Stop’s (SHOP) result was unimpressive. We understand that there is a general slowdown in the sector; however, SHOP’s accelerated underperformance in private labels (a key strategic pillar – over the last six quarters); - 12% YoY in revenue, is concerning. Key positives in the result include: (1) Relative outperformance in beauty (which continues to grow ahead of overall revenue). (2) On track scaling up of the value-retail franchise, Intune (at Zudio / Max equivalent price points). We believe, while incremental success for SHOP hinges on its fast-growth franchises – INTUNE / SSBeauty, it would be imperative for the company to revisit its departmental store business model, especially its private label strategy to solve for growth amidst rising competition in the industry.

The management maintained guidance of ~26-28% AUM growth and ~1.75- 1.85% credit cost for FY25, with an upward bias in credit cost. To reflect the Q1 developments and management commentary, we have adjusted our FY25-27 estimates, leading to a ~2% cut in earnings owing to ~12bps increase in credit cost to ~1.9%.

The management maintained its aspiration of 2.2% RoA for FY25, with 20% asset growth—which we see as a daunting task, given that improving each input factor driving the RoA is not only difficult but also contingent on many externalities.

Prominent titles to boost Q2FY25 collections: Kalki (spill over), Deadpool and Wolverine, Stree 2, Vedaa and Devara Part 1. We believe this could help in reversing the losses of H1CY24. In particular, Q3FY25E could rival the success of Q2FY24, in our view. Reiterate BUY with TP of INR 2,000. On Jul 22, ’24, PVR Inox hosted its earnings call. The session provided clarity on many points highlighted in our previous note (link). A summary of the key points is given below. Outlook We maintain our target price of INR 2,000 with a multiple of 16x adj. EBITDA (1-year forward). Key risks: Lower-than-expected performance of upcoming movies and merger synergies not playing out as expected.

Footfalls fell further to 30.4mn, down 6.7% QoQ, whereas ATP inched up marginally to Rs235 from Rs233 in Q4 albeit still impacted by the lack of big-budget releases and higher promotional offers. Occupancy was weak at 20.6%. Select small-tomid- budget movies did see some traction, though not enough to move the needle. The management is taking steps to drive higher revenue and to optimize costs, but these are likely to fructify only in the medium term. The near-term movie pipeline has improved which should result in some pick-up in collections going ahead. Outlook We cut FY25E/26E EBITDA by 9%/2%, to factor in the Q1 performance; also, we introduce FY27 estimates.

However, the bank managed to report slight NIM improvement of 3bps QoQ to 3.66%, likely defying the industry trend. That said, lower treasury gains led to 3% PAT miss at Rs162bn. Going forward, Bank has guided to further calibrate credit growth (lower than deposit growth), reduce its high LDR to premerger levels, mobilise PSL (organically/inorganically), and still manage margins aided by improving portfolio mix and funding cost by gradually retiring eHDFCL’s high-cost debt. Thus, we have cut our credit growth estimates over FY25-27 to 10-12% from 12-14%, partly offset by contained credit cost, thereby leading to earnings cut of 2-6%. However, Outlook we retain BUY with TP of Rs2,000/sh, rolling fwd on 2.4x Jun-26E standalone bank ABV and better subs valuations (Rs270/sh vs Rs250 earlier).

United Spirits stock zooms to lifetime high on positive Q1 performance,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/united-spirits-stock-zooms-to-lifetime-high-on-positive-q1-performance-12776681.html,Stocks,"July 24, 2024 10:56 AM","United Spirits shares soared 6.5 percent to hit a record high of Rs 1,417.30 on July 24, a day after the liquor company reported positive earnings for the April-June period. The company's net profit grew around 2 percent on year to Rs 485 crore in Q1 on FY25, up from Rs 477 crore. Revenue also rose 3.5 percent to Rs 2,761 crore against Rs 2,667 crore in the corresponding quarter of the preceding fiscal. Even though the topline as well as bottomline growth seems modest, it was still above what most brokerages anticipated. Growth for the company was anticipated to be weak on year due to inflationary impact on price-sensitive consumers. The better-than-expected performance on those fronts was driven by a 10 percent growth in the company's ‘prestige & above’ segment which delivered a little over 10 percent rise in sales. Volume growth for the segment also came at 3.5 percent. Meanwhile, analysts also commended the 170 basis point on year expansion in the company's EBITDA margin, which came at 19.5 percent in the June quarter, thanks to cost optimisation measures. Follow our live blog for all the updates In addition, the liquor company also announced two acquisitions. Firstly, it will acquire a 15 percent stake in V9 Beverages, which owns the drinks brand Sober, for a sum of Rs 2.3 crore. Sober is engaged in developing, producing, marketing, and selling zero-proof alcohol beverages under the brand name ‘Sober’. With this acquisition, United Spirits aims to provide consumers with a wider choice of drinks for social and personal occasions. This investment also allows the company to continue partnering with innovative start-up entrepreneurs to explore emerging consumer trends in the category. Aside from that, United Spirits will also acquire a 25 percent stake in Indie Brews and Spirits, which owns the brand Quaffine for Rs 5 crore. Quaffine is engaged in developing, marketing, and selling specialty cold-brew coffee liqueurs. Positioned as a mid-proof alcohol in the premium craft segment, it uses Indian coffee beans and caters to a variety of drinking occasions, particularly where casual-moderate drinking is increasing. Volumes in the counter also surged as 38 lakh shares of United Spirits changed hands so far, significantly higher than the one-month daily traded average of nine lakh shares.

Torrent Pharma's well rounded Q1 performance wins over brokerages,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/torrent-pharmas-well-rounded-q1-performance-wins-over-brokerages-12776543.html,Stocks,"July 24, 2024 09:56 AM","Pharmaceutical company, Torrent Pharma's strong performance across all key parameters in the April-June quarter has garnered praise from brokerages. Most analysts on the Street also paint a promising growth picture due to its solid domestic performance, robust margin profile, and expanding presence in the US market. The company delivered a 20 percent on-year spike in net profit for Q1 of FY25 at Rs 457 crore while revenue rose over 10 percent to Rs 2,859 crore. The moderate topline growth also factors in adverse impact from one-off costs, excluding which the rise in revenue would be even stronger, brokerage firm Jefferies noted. Torrent Pharma's performance in the domestic market remained strong, however, sales in Brazil delivered subdued growth due to the impact of floods in the country and adverse currency depreciation. Nonetheless, the drugmaker is attempting to diversify its markets by strengthening its presence across Germany and the US, a move seen in a positive light by brokerages. The company has increased its tender win rate in Germany thanks to cost reduction programs that have enhanced its competitiveness. In the US, the company anticipates that new product approvals to accelerate, boosting its sales growth. Jefferies also remains confident over the drugmaker, expecting Torrent to continue its strong run and international regions' growth to pick up pace from coming quarters. Follow our live blog for all the updates Nuvama Institutional Equities too shares a similar view, anticipating the company to continue to experience double-digit revenue growth led by domestic chronic business, post-flood recovery in the Brazil business and tender wins in the German market. Meanwhile, Jefferies also applauded Torrent Pharma's strong margin profile. The company's  EBITDA margin expanded to 31.6 percent in the quarter gone by, up from 30.5 percent recorded in the year ago period. On the other hand, gross margin surged to a multi-year high of 75.7 percent in the quarter, which was driven by strong growth in the India market, Jefferies stated. ""Torrent seems to be on the cusp of firing on all cylinders with strong Indiagrowth and international regions also joining the growth momentum,""  Jefferies said. ""High sales growth coupled with stable to soft raw material prices will continue to provide margin tailwinds for the company,"" it added. Along with that, the firm also retained its 'buy' call on the stock with a price target of Rs 3,540. Much like Jefferies, Nuvama also reiterated its 'buy' call on Torrent Pharma, but raised its price target for the stock by over 20 percent to Rs 3,606. Motilal Oswal Financial Services also sees Torrent Pharma as a promising play in the pharma space, as it derives 64 percent of its revenue from branded generics and delivers sustainable outperformance over the industry in domestic as well as Brazil markets. Meanwhile, the brokerage expects Torrent's drug approvals in the US to pick up, which would not only boost revenue growth but also improve the profitability of the US generics segment. Despite anticipating strong growth for Torrent, MOFSL still chose to retain its 'neutral' stance on the stock, citing limited upside from current levels. It has a price target of Rs 3,340 for the stock. At 09.20 am, shares of Torrent Pharma were trading  3.4 percent lower at Rs 3,032.80 on the NSE.

About 1,410 shares declined, while 933 shares advanced on the NSE. Experts see the Nifty 50 moving towards the 24,600-24,700 zone in the immediate term, as long as it holds 24,400 as a support. Here are some trading ideas for the near term: Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Avanti Feeds | CMP: Rs 645.35  Avanti Feeds jumped by more than 10 percent during the day on July 23 after Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that the central government would encourage financing and marketing for shrimp farming via the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD). Despite the sharp rise, prices failed to close above the consolidated zone. A close above Rs 650 is essential for the bullish momentum to continue. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) has shown a bullish crossover, but confirmation is still pending, requiring follow-up buying. The trend for Avanti Feeds is positive. A break above Rs 650 can lift the price higher towards Rs 680, followed by Rs 700, as long as Rs 625 holds on the downside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 680, Rs 700 Stop-Loss: Rs 625 Godrej Consumer Products | CMP: Rs 1,516.70  Godrej Consumer Products rallied around 3 percent on Tuesday. The Nifty FMCG index has rallied more than 10 percent since the beginning of July 2024. The budget announcement towards improving rural demand has fueled the rally in FMCG stocks. Prices gave a breakout of the Rounding Bottom pattern in the previous session, which is a positive sign. Prices also broke out of the upper end of the Bollinger Bands, showcasing a bullish trend. The KST (Know Sure Thing) indicator has turned above the signal line and continues to trade above zero levels, indicating good momentum. The overall trend of the stock is bullish. Use dips as a buying opportunity with a target of Rs 1,580 followed by Rs 1,620. On the downside, Rs 1,450 can act as crucial support. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,580, Rs 1,620 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,450 Chemfab Alkalies | CMP: Rs 787.85  Chemfab Alkalies has been moving higher recently and is in a strong uptrend. In the previous session, it closed with a massive gain of 9.17 percent. Prices formed a bullish candle and closed above Rs 744, confirming a breakout of the Rounding Bottom pattern. Prices continue to trade above the Ichimoku cloud, indicating that the short-term bias is likely to remain bullish. The trend for this stock is positive. Use dips towards Rs 770-780 as a buying opportunity for a move towards Rs 850-860 levels, as long as Rs 740 holds on the downside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 850, Rs 860 Stop-Loss: Rs 740 Dhupesh Dhameja, Technical Analyst at SAMCO Securities Tata Consultancy Services | CMP: Rs 4,302.35  TCS has recently achieved a significant breakout from its all-time high of Rs 4,254 and is currently sustaining above this level. On the daily chart, the stock has completed a Rounding Base chart pattern with a neckline at Rs 4,250. Price trading above its key averages on the daily chart indicates strong bullish sentiment. The weekly chart reveals a multi-year breakout, with the stock trading above its 10-week moving average, further underscoring the bullish trend. The RSI stands at 72 on the daily chart and 66 on the weekly chart, confirming strong momentum. We recommend buying the stock at the current market price of Rs 4,311. We anticipate an upside potential with target prices ranging from Rs 4,500 to 4,650. The bullish outlook remains intact as long as the stock price stays above Rs 4,170. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,500, Rs 4,650 Stop-Loss: Rs 4,170 Uno Minda | CMP: Rs 1,011.35  Uno Minda has recently experienced a substantial rally, nearly doubling from its previous low of Rs 600 to a high of Rs 1,200 in July. It has now completed a retracement to the 0.50 Fibonacci extension level at Rs 950, finding strong support at this point. The stock performed a fake-out from its 50-day moving average. On the weekly chart, it finds robust support at the 10-week moving average. The RSI is above 60 on the weekly chart, while the daily chart shows RSI support at the 40 level. Considering these factors, we recommend buying at the current market price of Rs 1,009.25. We foresee an upside potential with target prices between Rs 1,100 and Rs 1,180. The bullish outlook remains valid as long as the stock price stays above Rs 930. In the Union Budget, the government increased the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for automobiles and auto components to Rs 3,500 crore for FY25, up from Rs 604 crore in FY24.

Limited sops from the Budget for consumption with no direct rural benefit,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/limited-sops-from-the-budget-for-consumption-with-no-direct-rural-benefit-12776408.html,Stocks,"July 23, 2024 08:31 PM","HighlightsModerate increase in rural development and welfare measuresDuty reduction and incentives restricted to a few segmentsIncreased standard deduction and enhanced tax slabs to support urban consumersEasing inflationary pressures and rising incomes to lead to a pick-up in the consumption spaceThe consumption sector has been lagging the overall economic growth. Private final consumption expenditure (forms about 55 percent of the Gross Domestic Product) has grown by 4 percent in FY24 as against the overall GDP growth of about 8.2 percent. High inflation environment had curbed discretionary spending, especially in rural areas, thus affecting  consumption. There was a limited increase in rural development and agricultural spends to boost rural consumption, which is particularly under pressure. The allocation towards agriculture and farmer welfare (incentives such as crop insurance, interest subvention schemes) stood at Rs 122,528 crore this fiscal, a marginal 5 percent increase compared to the revised estimates of 2023-24. Moreover, the department of rural development (rural employment initiatives such as MGNREGA, Gram Sadak Yojana and rural livelihood schemes) has seen a moderate increase of 4 percent YoY. Measures to boost employment by reducing custom duties and providing incentives have been restricted to a few sectors such as jewellery, footwear and leather accessories, solar, and aquaculture sectors. There has been no sector addition to the PLI (production-linked incentive) scheme which can boost manufacturing and create jobs. The government has enhanced the standard deduction from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000 in the Union Budget. Also, tax structure in the low to middle slabs has been raised slightly upwards thus reducing the tax liability. As per the calculations of the Finance Ministry, owing to above changes, a salaried employee under the new tax regime would save upto Rs 17,500 in income tax. Tax savings would enhance the disposable incomes and provide boost to consumption, but the move is directed more towards the urban strata of consumers employed in formal sector. Also, the reduction in import duties from 15 percent to 6 percent on precious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum is expected to boost demand for the jewellery sector. While the Budget falls short on consumption push, there could be a pick-up in growth in FY2025. With easing inflationary pressures, higher minimum support prices for crops, and the expectations of a normal monsoon will provide fillip to consumption demand and stimulate growth for FMCG and rural companies. FMCG stocks such as HUL, Dabur, and Emami and rural-centric retail companies like Hero Motocorp, M&M, Relaxo Footwear, and Cantabil Retail India are likely to see a pick-up in demand. We also expect acceleration in growth for companies having urban focus due to tax sops and the rise in national incomes due to higher GDP growth. Companies such as Trent and Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail (apparel), Metro Brands (footwear), Jubilant Foodworks and Devyani International (Quick service restaurants), and Havells (urban consumption) should benefit.

Budget's duty reduction on leather imports to boost demand,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/budgets-duty-reduction-on-leather-imports-to-boost-demand-12776388.html,Stocks,"July 23, 2024 08:05 PM","The government has reduced the customs duty on wet white, crust, and finished leather used in the manufacture of leather/synthetic footwear from 10 percent to zero. Leather is a key raw material for footwear manufacturers such as Bata India and Metro Brands, which have significant leather-based offerings (formal and office wear shoes). Leather as a raw material is mostly imported and the duty reduction is likely to reduce input costs for these companies. We expect about 5 percent reduction in leather footwear prices, considering that raw material forms about half of the overall costs. The cost reduction is likely to be passed on to end-consumers as footwear companies are facing subdued SSSG (same store sales growth). Bata posted flattish sales in FY24, while Metro Brands sales growth has moderated to 10 percent YoY in the same period. Price reductions will boost demand and would be positive for these companies.

Double bonanza for the aquaculture sector in the Union Budget,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/double-bonanza-for-the-aquaculture-sector-in-the-union-budget-12776046.html,Stocks,"July 23, 2024 07:37 PM","In the Union Budget 2024, the finance minister made some significant announcements to facilitate the growth of the aquaculture industry. India is the third-largest fish producing country, contributing around 8 percent to the global fish production. In FY23, India generated a record high forex revenue of Rs 55,000 crore by exporting seafoods. Exports, in terms of quantity, jumped 27 percent YoY. India mainly exports frozen shrimps, which contributed 40 percent in terms of volume and 70 percent in terms of value. Fish, cuttlefish, squids, dried items, and live and chilled items comprise the rest. Frozen fish, the second-largest exported item, fetched over Rs 5,500 crore. The US, Europe, and China turned out to be the major importers of India’s seafood. In 2020, the Government of India had launched the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) to transform and facilitate the growth of the fisheries and aquaculture sector.  The scheme had an investment outlay of Rs 20,000 crore (from 2020 to 2024-25). The government remains committed to double aquaculture exports to nearly Rs 1 lakh crore and generate over 50 lakh job employment opportunities in the rural economy over medium term. In Budget 2024, the finance minister announced an allocation of Rs 20,000 crore to the Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF). Development and the modernisation of breeding centres, aqua parks, shrimp farming, processing units, fishing harbours, landing centres, fish markets, fish-landing centres, cold chain infrastructure, and logistics will strengthen the productivity and yield of the aquaculture sector. The financing for the same will be supported by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD). To enhance cost competitiveness, the finance minister also announced a significant reduction of Basic Customs Duty from 15 percent to 5 percent on certain feedstock, polychaete worms, and shrimp & fish feed.  Besides, various inputs (Krill Meal, Fish lipid oil, Crude fish oil etc.) for the manufacture of shrimp and fish feed will be exempt from customs duty. The efforts to strengthen the aquaculture, mariculture and allied sectors will contribute to the growth of the rural economy and increase farmers' incomes. Apex Frozen Foods, Avanti Feeds, and Waterbase, which operate in the marine value chain, stand to benefit from these developments. Avanti Feeds is the market leader in domestic shrimp feed and a key exporter of processed shrimps. While Apex Frozen Foods is an integrated producer and exporter of frozen shrimps, Waterbase is a key manufacturer of shrimp and prawn feed.

""We expect NIMs to resume its sideways movement after one more quarter. Margin contraction seen in the June-ended quarter was attributed primarily to higher funding costs as well as AUM composition,"" the management said in their post-earnings conference call. In Q1FY25, the cost of funds increased by 8 basis points, on a sequential basis, to 7.94 percent. Looking ahead, the management indicated that funding costs are expected to decrease, and the RBI's interest rate easing would further moderate margin compression.

The extant duty was 10 percent. One interesting beneficiary of this announcement is Astrazeneca Pharma India Ltd, which is owned by MNC AstraZeneca plc. These drugs are manufactured by Astrazeneca in the US/UK and are imported to India. The company launched Trastuzumab Deruxtecan in India in January this year for the treatment of breast cancer. As recently as March, the company received an approval from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) to import for the sale and distribution of Trastuzumab Deruxtecan for two new indications. In its annual report, the company mentions that in the last financial year Durvalumab (Imfinzi) was adopted as a standard care for indicated patients with advanced Biliary Tract Cancer (BTC). The rapid adoption and growth of Imfinzi in BTC was the key driver for the overall growth of the brand in the FY24. While these are recent developments, Osimertinib (Tagrisso) is the company’s key offering for the treatment of lung cancer. Tagrisso is one of the Top Ten oncology brands in India as per IPSOS MAT Jun ’23 and continues to be the largest oncology brand by sales for AstraZeneca India. Reduced custom duties for the key drugs would help in better affordability for patients in India and should aid the company’s sales. It is notable that the company gets 62 percent of sales from oncology. However, the EBITDA margin at 14 percent is not impressive. Further, the stock is trading at an elevated trailing valuation multiple of 78x EV/EBITDA.

Five key stocks expected to benefit from the Budget,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/five-key-stocks-expected-to-benefit-from-the-budget-12776359.html,Stocks,"July 23, 2024 07:39 PM","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman made a number of announcements on agriculture, generating employment, and reduction in import duties for gold, and silver, among other things. Here are five stocks which market experts believe are likely to benefit from the announcements. Godrej AgrovetAs much as Rs 1.52 lakh crore has been set aside for agriculture and allied sectors – an increase from the Rs 1.27 lakh crore earmarked in the Interim Budget. Further, Sitharaman announced financial support for setting up a network of Nucleus Breeding Centers for Shrimp Broodstocks with the basic customs duty on certain broodstock, polychaete worms, shrimp, and fish feed reduced to 5 percent. Customs duties have also been exempted on various inputs for manufacturing shrimp and fish feed. These factors are expected to benefit agriculture-based stocks like Godrej Agrovet, said Saurabh Mukherjea in a conversation with Moneycontrol. Godrej Agrovet is involved in the business of animal feed for cattle and shrimp. It also sells vegetable oil, crop protection products, dairy, and poultry. Marcellus, in a note to its shareholders, said, “We expect a much better outlook for Godrej Agrovet's earnings going forward, driven by favorable government policies such as the National Mission on Edible Oils – Oil Palms (NMEO-OP) and Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana, which are likely to impact the earnings of the vegetable oils and fish feed businesses respectively.” Titan CompanyIn order to enhance domestic value addition in gold and precious metal jewellery, the customs duty on gold and silver was reduced to 6 percent from 15 percent earlier. The reduction in customs duty will benefit players like Titan Company, where almost 87 percent of its product category is jewellery. Even though there is high competition in the jewellery segment, Titan Company is better placed than others because its new formats like Caratlane, Mia and Zoya will help sustain above teen growth in coming years, said Amnish Agarwal, head of research at Prabhudas Lilladher. Teamlease ServicesThe FM has announced that one crore youth will get internships in top Indian companies in the next five years. This move is set to benefit companies like Teamlease Services, which is an HR consultant, said Amit Doshi, fund manager at Care Portfolio. The company looks into recruitment, on-boarding, and operations of professionals. Borosil Renewables The government has increased the customs duty on solar glass in order to protect domestic solar glass manufacturers. Further, duties on certain additional capital goods used in the manufacture of solar cells and modules have been waived off. This announcement is expected to directly benefit players like Borosil Renewables, which is involved in the manufacturing of solar glass, said Agarwal. Adani WilmarTo achieve self-sufficiency in pulses and oilseeds, the government will strengthen their production, storage, and marketing, said the FM in her budget speech. She mentioned that a strategy is being put in place to achieve 'atmanirbharta' for oilseeds such as mustard, groundnut, sesame, soybean, and sunflower. Adani Wilmar will benefit from this as it manufactures soybean oil, palm oil, sunflower oil, rice bran oil, mustard oil, groundnut oil, and others, said Divam Sharma of Green Portfolio.

The company will release its Q1 results on July 24, 2024. According to the average estimate of eight brokerages, Mumbai-headquartered Axis Bank is projected to register a 13 percent year-on-year (YoY) profit growth at Rs 6,576 crore in Q1FY25 as against Rs 5,797 crore in Q1FY24. NII is also expected to rise by 12 percent YoY to Rs 13,361 crore in Q1FY25, compared to Rs 11,958 crore in the same period last year.  What factors are driving the earnings? Strong loan, deposit growth: Axis Bank's loans, or advances, are expected to increase by 13.5 percent YoY to Rs 9.74 lakh crore in Q1FY25, while deposits are predicted to grow by 12.3 percent YoY to Rs 10.5 lakh crore, according to analysts at YES Securities. Improving asset quality: The lender's gross non-performing assets (NPA) are likely to decrease to 1.5 percent in the quarter ended June, down from 1.7 percent in the same period last year. Net NPA is also expected to improve to 0.3 percent in Q1FY25, from 0.4 percent a year ago, according to Motilal Oswal analysts. Margin contraction: Analysts at Phillip Capital anticipate a 6 basis points (bps) YoY contraction in Axis Bank's margins to 4.04 percent in Q1FY25, down from 4.1 percent in Q1FY24 due to rising funding costs. What to look out for in the quarterly show?

Budget's tax cut benefit overshadowed by indexation losses,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/budgets-tax-cut-benefit-overshadowed-by-indexation-losses-12776278.html,Stocks,"July 23, 2024 06:25 PM","The Union Budget 2024 has introduced significant changes in the taxation of property, reflecting the government's efforts to diversify the investment landscape. One of the notable adjustments is the reduction of the Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax rates. While this reduction may be aiming to attract more investment into property and bring in tax rationalisation compared to equity asset class, removal of the indexation benefit is a dampener. Before the budget, property sales were subject to a 20 percent LTCG tax rate with the indexation benefit. The new tax rate of 12.5 percent comes without the indexation benefit, which is a significant change. The removal of the indexation benefit is disappointing for long-term investors who have relied on it to mitigate the impact of inflation on their gains. Real estate investments, particularly which are long-dated, are expected to have higher effective capital gains tax on account of the new provision. The immediate impact of these changes is visible in the real estate sector. The stocks of major real estate companies such as DLF Ltd, Godrej Properties, Oberoi Realty, and Brigade Enterprises have dropped by 3-5 percent by the end of the day. While the reduced tax rate aims to attract investment, the elimination of the indexation benefit could pose challenges for long-term holders, potentially leading to higher tax liabilities and affecting investment decisions in the real estate sector.

"Budget 2024: Bulls leap over yet another wall of worry, this time higher capital market taxes",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/budget-2024-bulls-leap-over-yet-another-wall-of-worry-this-time-higher-capital-market-taxes-12776303.html,Stocks,"July 23, 2024 06:15 PM","Santosh Nair Dalal Street was widely expecting the Budget to have a rural slant after the BJP’s recent subpar electoral performance, but not the slew of tax hikes that was thrown their way. The popular reasoning was that any tinkering with the capital gains tax structure could spark a sell-off in an already frothy market, something the government would be keen to avoid. Much to their surprise, both long term and short term capital taxes were hiked, and so was the securities transaction tax (STT) on derivatives trades. In addition, income from share buyback which was so far taxed at 20 percent will be treated as dividend and taxed as per the income tax slab of the investor. Interestingly, after a sudden plunge, the market overcame its disappointment quickly and at one point briefly crossed over to the positive before ending slightly lower, but well off the lows for the day. What explains the dramatic recovery? The most dominant factor is strong liquidity, which for the moment seems to be drowning out concerns of expensive valuations. Retail inflows have been quite strong, through direct equity investments as well as vehicles like mutual funds, portfolio management service (PMS) funds and Alternate Investment Funds (AIFs). More importantly, foreign portfolio investors who were complaining of rich valuations till a couple of months back, too have joined the party. Post the election verdict, FPIs have net bought over Rs 55,000 crore worth of shares.This is in addition to the Rs 20,000 crore odd that is flowing into the systematic investment plans (SIPs) of domestic funds every month. Two, the buy-on-dips strategy is working like a charm as far retail investors are concerned. And this is only attracting more players waiting on the sidelines. In March, market regulator SEBI had warned of a froth in small and midcaps. After a short lived correction, the market has rallied even more stronly from those levels. Many mutual funds increased their cash holdings in recent weeks, fearing that valuations had gotten out of whack. But the cumulative cash positions of all mutual funds put together, even at 4-5 percent of their portfolios, accounts to well over a trillion rupees. And when the market keeps moving higher, the funds have little choice but to put their money to work. Thirdly, while many promoters and private equity investors have been selling stakes over the past many months, a good chunk of that money too is again finding its way back into the stock market, either directly or via family offices and AIFs. Still, the concerns about valuations are hard to ignore. Prashant Jain of 3P Investment Managers said the Budget was overall positive despite the tax hikes, but he is cautious in his outlook, barring some pockets of the market. In particular, he is bearish on stocks in the manufacturing, industrial, and defence sectors, irrespective of whether they are public sector or private. Jain's caution stems from the sharp surge in these stocks over the last year. While markets are pricing extremely high growth for these sectors, Jain believes the risk-reward ratio for stocks in this space is unfavourable at this time. And some of the derivatives traders too feel most market participants are reading too much into Tuesday’s recovery from the intra-day lows. “Last year, there was an increase in STT, and we closed 0.20% down, but the following week it fell by 1.5%,” said Rajesh Srivastava, a Bengaluru-based trader. “The impact is always felt on over the following days,"" he said. Emkay Global's strategist Seshadri Sen has warned of an impending 5-10 percent correction in the Nifty in the days ahead as Nifty valuations are already pricey at 21.4 times one year forward earnings and that the market is running out of triggers to sustain such lofty valuations. Also, world markets have begun to sell off and it is a matter of time before the Indian markets too become a part of the global correction, according to Sushil Kedia, founder of Kedianomics, in conversation with Moneycontrol.

Sheersham Gupta, Director and Senior Technical Analyst at Rupeezy, noted that the increase in tax on F&O and capital gains in today's Union Budget indicates that the government aims to encourage retail investors to shift away from speculative activities. ALSO READ: Broking shares fall after increase in LTCG and STT ""On average, the 60-65% increase in STT could lead to an additional Rs 45 to 50 in STT for a Nifty futures contract.

However, it is likely to have a noticeable impact on very short-term trading activities, such as scalping or intraday trading,"" said Gupta. May Trigger Changes in Strategy for Algo traders Rajesh Srivastava, a derivatives trader, believes that F&O traders, particularly those into algorithm-driven trading will need to fine tune some of their strategies as every trade will incur an additional cost. ""It will affect algo trading strategies due to reduced liquidity, which leads to higher impact costs. Our strategies consider the cost at a certain point. For example, if my Bank Nifty options cost is 6 points, I have to add a few points. Thus, the strategy has to be very low cost for long-term viability,"" added Srivastava. The market shrugged and took the announcement in its stride, as well as the higher taxes on long term capital gains and short term capital gains, and recovered from the day's lows even as benchmark indices closed in the red. ""You will see continued downtrend momentum tomorrow. Last year, there was an increase in STT, and we closed 0.20% down, but the following week it fell by 1.5%. The impact is always felt on the second day,"" he said. Santosh Pasi, another derivatives trader, said, ""The STT increase is disappointing news for derivative traders. While it will add more to the government's tax revenue, it won't impact the volume of derivatives trading significantly, as many new traders are regularly entering our market. Professional traders will be more cautious, potentially reducing volume marginally or shifting to more positional trades instead of intraday trades."" Rise in Positional Trade Volumes Expected Compared to Intraday ""Our country is developing, and we will see a further increase in volumes of both equities and derivatives. Positional trade volumes might increase while intraday trading will reduce,"" added Pasi. Arun Kumar Mantri, Founder of Mantri Finmart, said, ""Yes, it will be a short-term sentiment dampener, but in the long term, the markets will digest this news, and the broader markets will settle within the next 7-10 days. There has been an initial reaction, and it may continue for a few more days, but we expect the markets to stabilize with positivity in the medium to long-term perspective.""

The Central Government will support the infrastructure development of Andhra’s proposed capital  Amaravati, the dream city of Chandrababu Naidu who is a key ally of the ruling NDA (National Democratic Alliance) regime. The government will provide Rs 15,000 crore in the current financial year for the development of the capital city with additional allocations expected in the future. Apart from the capital city, the government will focus on other infrastructure projects in Andhra Pradesh such as the Polavaram Irrigation project, and water, rail and road projects in other regions of Andhra Pradesh such as Kopparathy and Orvakal industrial nodes. Moreover, the government will provide for the development of the backward regions of Rayalaseema, Prakasam, and North Coastal Andhra. In Bihar, the government will support the development of road connectivity projects worth Rs 26,000 crore as well as a power project worth Rs 21,400 crore. New airports, medical colleges, and sports infrastructure will also be built in Bihar. Moreover, the overall development of infrastructure in other eastern states such as Odisha, Jharkhand, and West Bengal will provide order opportunity for NCC. NCC has a strong understanding of the eastern market (several projects are under execution) and will benefit from these developments.

"Benefits of fiscal consolidation will outweigh capital gains tax hike impact, says Kotak's Nilesh Shah",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/benefits-of-fiscal-consolidation-will-outweigh-capital-gains-tax-hike-impact-says-kotaks-nilesh-shah-12776071.html,Stocks,"July 23, 2024 04:47 PM","Nilesh Shah, Managing Director of Kotak Mutual Fund, believes that while there are concerns around the increase in capital gains tax announced in the Union Budget, the benefits of fiscal consolidation would outweigh the potential drawbacks of the tax increase. ""I am delighted by the fiscal consolidation in the budget,"" said Shah in an exclusive interaction with Moneycontrol. ""Last year, the fiscal deficit was 5.8 percent when the budget was presented, and now we are talking about 4.9 percent. With tax buoyancy, potential divestment, and potential higher dividends from the RBI as well as PSU companies, this number can even surprise further,” he said. Read: HUL Q1 results beat estimates, net profit up 1.5% at Rs 2,538 crore The central government has set a fiscal deficit target of 4.9 percent of GDP for 2024-25, as per the budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. This target is notably lower than the 5.1 percent set in the interim Budget, which itself was a substantial 70 basis points below the previous fiscal year's revised estimate of 5.8 percent. (One basis point is equal to one-hundredth of a percentage point.)

He expressed optimism that India could transition from a primary deficit to a primary surplus country within the next three to four years.

This amounts to a sharp 9 percent reduction in duties, which will be passed onto end-consumers and will benefit listed formal jewellery retail players such as Titan Company, Thangamayil Jewellery, and Senco Gold. The duty cut on imports is also positive for jewellery manufacturers like Sky Gold. Raw material price differential between the formal industry (imports via authorised channels) and illegal imports (circumventing duty) will also reduce, considering the steep reduction in imports, which is beneficial for formal and organised jewellery players. The price reduction on the final product to end-consumers will be to the tune of about 6 percent, considering that raw material costs form about 70-75 percent of the overall costs of jewellery companies. Jewellery demand had been affected by a steep increase in gold prices (grew about 20 percent YoY) with leading players such as Titan Company and Senco Gold reporting a high single-digit growth in Q1FY25 compared to the historical robust double-digit growth trend. A reduction in the prices is likely to spur jewellery demand and encourage consumers who were waiting on the sidelines to buy jewellery.

However, Jain is cautious in his outlook, barring some pockets of the market. He is bearish on stocks in the manufacturing, industrial, and defence sectors, irrespective of whether they are public sector or private. Jain's caution stems from the sharp surge in these stocks over the last year.

Talking about the revival in the consumption space, Jain said that the government, with its measures to boost economic growth, lower tax rates, and create jobs, is working in this direction. However, regarding consumption stocks, Jain believes that consumer staples have outperformed for a long time and are still a little expensive. Meanwhile, the consumer discretionary space looks better, even though the stocks in this space are not exactly cheap either.

"Budget 2024 Trading Strategy: Trade Set Up for Budget-sensitive stocks. What to watch, key levels",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/budget/budget-2024-trading-strategy-trade-set-up-for-budget-sensitive-stocks-what-to-watch-key-levels-12775301.html,Stocks,"July 23, 2024 03:29 PM","The benchmark indices showed a smart recovery, trading moderately lower, after the Union Budget met street expectations on July 23. Experts advised focusing on the 24,200-24,000 levels on the downside for the Nifty 50, and 24,850-25,000 on the higher side, while continuing with a buy-on-dips strategy. Here are the top budget-sensitive stocks to bet on and their levels to watch: Ashish Kyal, CMT, Author Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors REC | CMP: Rs 618.8  REC shows a bullish trend with prices above the Ichimoku Cloud. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates positive momentum as it is reversing back from near 50 levels. Long positions can be created with a stop-loss at Rs 580 and target levels at Rs 660, which is near the upper end of the channel. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 660 Stop-Loss: Rs 580 Petronet LNG | CMP: Rs 341.35  Petronet LNG, a leading player in the LNG infrastructure sector, has shown a bullish trend, with a strong support level at Rs 330. The RSI indicates bullish momentum, and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) suggests a buy signal. The stock also bounced back from the 20-day moving average support. A break above Rs 344 will indicate a buy for a move towards Rs 364, with a stop-loss near Rs 330 levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 364 Stop-Loss: Rs 330 Bharat Dynamics | CMP: Rs 1,493.75  BDL is exhibiting a strong bullish trend, with a recent bounce back above the 50-day moving average (MA). BDL has completed wave 4 and can start wave 5 on the higher side, which can take prices to the previous high near Rs 1,720 levels. We recommend a buy position with a stop-loss at Rs 1,380 (recent swing low) and target levels at Rs 1,720. The long-term trend is turning bullish, with the 20-day MA above the 50-day MA, providing additional upside momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,550, Rs 1,720 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,380 Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments & Securities Hindustan Unilever | CMP: Rs 2,735.3  Hindustan Unilever (HUL) is showcasing a robust 150-week long Cup and Handle pattern on its weekly charts, with a critical neckline at Rs 2,680. During the base formation, volumes remained subdued, but the subsequent rally to the neckline has witnessed substantial volumes, indicating broad-based participation by smart money. Given the positive budget outlook for FMCG companies, HUL emerges as an attractive buy opportunity at Rs 2,750, with a stop-loss set below Rs 2,650 and an ambitious target of Rs 3,000+. The strong technical setup, coupled with favorable macroeconomic factors, positions HUL as a compelling choice for investors looking for growth in the FMCG sector. This setup highlights the stock's potential for significant upside in the coming months. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,000 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,650 Apex Frozen Foods | CMP: Rs 251.25  The upcoming budget is anticipated to emphasize frozen food and logistics sectors, positioning Apex Frozen Foods as a significant beneficiary. Technically, Apex Frozen has formed a 68-week-long Double Bottom pattern with the right bottom emerging on extremely dried-up volumes, indicating strong accumulation. This pattern typically suggests a reversal and a potential uptrend. The stock presents an attractive buy opportunity at the current market price of Rs 251, with an immediate stop-loss on a close below Rs 220. With the budget likely to focus on these sectors, Apex Frozen Foods could see a substantial upside, targeting Rs 345. Investors should keep an eye on this stock for a promising breakout in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 345 Stop-Loss: Rs 220 Snowman Logistics | CMP: Rs 74.37  The upcoming budget is anticipated to heavily emphasize the logistics sector, making Snowman Logistics a standout contender for potential gains. Snowman Logistics is displaying exceptional technical strength, with a 19-week-long Cup and Handle pattern forming on the weekly charts. This classic bullish pattern is backed by volume dynamics—volumes remained subdued during the Cup formation but surged significantly as the stock approached the Handle's neckline. This suggests strong buying interest and accumulation. Given the stock's current market price of Rs 74, investors can consider buying with a stop-loss at Rs 65 and a target of Rs 90. With the expected budget boost to logistics, Snowman Logistics is well-positioned for substantial returns. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 90 Stop-Loss: Rs 65 Navkar Corporation | CMP: Rs 137.58  The upcoming budget is expected to be highly favourable for Navkar Corporation, and the stock's technicals are aligning perfectly with this outlook. Navkar Corp has broken out of a bullish 25-week-long Cup and Handle pattern on the weekly chart, which is a classic indicator of a strong upward trend. The breakout has been accompanied by significant follow-through on substantial volumes, reinforcing the bullish sentiment. This volume surge during the breakout phase signals robust buying interest and institutional accumulation. Currently trading at Rs 137.58, Navkar Corp presents a compelling buy opportunity with a stop-loss below Rs 115. The immediate target for this trade setup is Rs 225, making it a potential high-reward investment in light of the positive budget expectations. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 225 Stop-Loss: Rs 115 Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi Tata Steel | CMP: Rs 160.32  Recently, Tata Steel experienced a significant decline, dropping nearly 22 rupees after forming a Double Top at Rs 180 level. This decline equates to a 12 percent fall, reflecting considerable selling pressure. However, the stock found support around its 150-day Exponential Moving Average (DEMA), indicating a potential stabilization point. On the indicator front, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) has formed an impulsive structure near the 30 oversold zone, which appears attractive at current levels. Therefore, we advise buying Tata Steel in the Rs 158-162 zone, with a target of Rs 175 and a stop-loss of Rs 153 on a daily close basis. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 175 Stop-Loss: Rs 153 Chemplast Sanmar | CMP: Rs 528.85  Recently, Chemplast Sanmar has been in a corrective phase. However, in the previous trading session, it found support at its previous breakout upper band, accompanied by significant volume. Additionally, the daily RSI has reversed from the 50 level on a daily scale, further affirming our bullish stance on the stock. Therefore, we recommend going long in the Rs 520-530 zone, with a target of Rs 600 and a stop-loss placed near Rs 488 on a daily close basis. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 600 Stop-Loss: Rs 488 Hikal | CMP: Rs 342.55  During the past few weeks, Hikal has been in a corrective phase, experiencing a downward adjustment in its price. However, in the previous trading session, the stock found support at the upper band of its previous breakout level, a crucial technical indicator suggesting potential stabilization. This support was further validated by the formation of a Bullish Piercing candlestick pattern, a reliable signal of a possible trend reversal. Additionally, the daily RSI, a momentum oscillator, has reversed from the 50 level on a daily scale, indicating renewed buying interest and further affirming our bullish outlook on the stock. Given these technical indicators, we recommend initiating a long position in the Rs 335-345 zone, with an upside target of Rs 390 and a stop-loss set at Rs 315 on a daily close basis to manage risk. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 390 Stop-Loss: Rs 315 Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

However, the government maintained capex unchanged at Rs 11.11 lakh crore for this fiscal year. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog The government plans to maintain strong fiscal support for infrastructure, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said while presenting the Union Budget. The government intends to continue substantial public spending to boost growth while pursuing fiscal consolidation. Specifically in railways, the interim budget planned significant upgrades to infrastructure, including converting 40,000 standard railway bogies to Vande Bharat standards to enhance passenger safety, comfort, and convenience.

Meanwhile, PFC, REC, IREDA, and NTPC saw an initial rise of around 2 percent in early trading but failed to sustain gains later on July 23 after the finance minister announced measures to support renewable energy and develop nuclear energy.

Owing to weak seasonality in Q1, Newgen reported QoQ revenue decline of 16.1%, in-line with consensus estimate of a 16.2% dip. Q1 is a seasonally weak quarter led by ramp down of 41.3% in products and platforms business. Annuity-based revenue was down 4.2% QoQ. AMC/ATS, Support declined -2.2%/ -7.5%, while SaaS grew +2.5%. Banking saw the sharpest ramp down of 17.3% QoQ. Geography-wise, APAC grew the most at 64.9% YoY, followed by EMEA and Australia at 25% growth each. North America region saw 13% growth. EMEA commanded the highest margin of 47%, followed by 28.4% for India. Newgen has regrouped its verticals from six earlier, to four now. Healthcare and insurance have been grouped as one and BPO and others under others. Banking was up 34.4% YoY. 13 large orders came from retail and BFSI (Malayasia, Qatar, Indonesia, US and India). Outlook Newgen reported in-line revenue growth of 25% YoY. EBIT margin was at 12.7%, outperforming consensus estimates of 11.3%, despite increased hiring, employee cost and investment in sales and marketing. APAC continued to do well with 64.9% YoY growth.

The Union Budget 2024-25 has emphasised the development of an open digital ecosystem. The finance minister has proposed the building of population scale DPI in the areas of credit, e-commerce, education, health, law and justice, logistics, MSME, services delivery, and urban governance.Please read: MC Budget Blog Also, Our complete Budget coverage The government wants to leverage the DPI in agriculture too. The Union Budget has proposed digital crop survey for Kharif using the DPI in 400 districts this year.  Moreover, the details of 6 crore farmers and their lands  are envisaged to be included in the farmer and land registries. The government’s initiative will be beneficial for Protean eGov Technologies (CMP: Rs 1,611; Mcap: Rs 6,518 crore; Rating: Overweight), which is a pioneer and market leader in building the DPI in collaboration with the government. Protean has already put in place the core agri stack for a universal farmer identity (ID), land records, crop registries, soil health record, and more. Market leader in NPS In addition to the digital push, Protean will benefit from the broadening of the National Pension Scheme (NPS). The Union Budget has proposed NPS Vatsalya for minors that can be converted into a normal NPS account after 18 years of age. It also talked about setting up of a committee to review the NPS. As a Central Record-keeping Agency (CRA) for the NPS, Protean has 97 percent market share in a three-player market.  CAMS and KFin Technologies are the other two CRAs for NPS. However, their cumulative market share is less than 4 percent in terms of pension AUM. There is a huge headroom for growth as pension penetration in India is just around 6 percent for private sector employees, while in the US almost 70 percent private sector employees are covered under pension, indicating a long roadway for growth. View and Valuation Protean’s stock has rallied more than 35 percent in the past one month and is trading at 48 times FY26 estimated earnings. Though the valuation is rich, it is justified because of the dominant market position in e-governance space, unique business moats, and tailwinds from the growing digital penetration.

The weakness was broad based with energy utilities/ manufacturing/health declining the most by -6.3%/-3%/-2.8% QoQ cc. Energy utilities ramp-down was because of some large projects winding down in the vertical. BFSI was flattish at 0.7% QoQ, unlike strong show by peers. Consumer business was the strongest with 1.6% QoQ growth. Geography wise, North America was strong similar to peers with 0.8% growth. Europe weakness continued with 1.9% QoQ USD decline.

Outlook Wipro’s (WPRO) 1% QoQ cc revenue decline stood lower than street / I-Sec’s estimate of flattish growth and was in contrast to the trend of positive growth surprises delivered by peers in Q1FY25-TD. The weakness stemmed from energy utilities, manufacturing and Europe. Management maintained demand environment remains largely unchanged vs Q4FY24 but indicated of green shoots going into Q2FY25.

Also, the increase in staff cost was arrested at a mere 4% YoY. While grey cement volumes surprised too, rising 6.7% YoY (vs. 4% expectation), weak prices spoiled the party. Realisation slipped 2.5% QoQ for the grey segment while at the bended level, they tripped 3% QoQ. Ergo, EBITDA/t at INR 951 slipped 7% YoY (19% QoQ), being 2% below expectation. EBITDA at INR 30.4bn was broadly in line. Outlook It is heartening to see UltraTech Cement (UTCEM) ‘walking-the-talk’ on cost rationalisation. Within a quarter of its guidance to prune cost by INR 200–300/t (over three years), it has begun to deliver on – lead distance reduction, increased share of green power and lowering the clinker factor. However, cost rationalisation is unlikely to drive earnings upgrade given our expectation of continued competitive intensity. Au contraire, sustained MoM weakness in cement prices, since Nov'23, is forcing our hand to chop FY25E EBITDA by 13%. Keeping faith in expected gains from cost-cut measures and current low fuel prices, we keep FY26E EBITDA intact. We see little merit in arguing in favour of a higher valuation multiple given our expectation of continued price volatility despite the rise in industry consolidation.

Housing finance stocks slip on profit-taking after urban housing Budget boost,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/housing-finance-stocks-slip-on-profit-taking-after-urban-housing-budget-boost-12773628.html,Stocks,"July 23, 2024 01:35 PM","Shares of LIC Housing Finance, Can Fin Homes, HUDCO, PNB Housing Finance, Home First, and Aptus Value Housing fell by up to 1 percent as investors chose to book profits on the Budget announcement of a Rs 10 lakh crore boost for urban housing. Shares of housing finance companies (HFCs) had rallied significantly in the run up to the Budget. The Budget also announced expansion of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) by adding 3 crore more houses to the scheme. Finance Minister, in her 2024 Budget speech, outlined that Urban 2.0 will address the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle-class families with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore. The plan also includes provisions for interest subsidies to offer loans at affordable rates. Of the 3 crore additional houses under PMAY, 2 crore will be allocated to rural areas. In the interim Budget presented in February, Rs 80,671 crore was allocated for PMAY. For 2023-24, the government initially earmarked Rs 79,590 crore, but this was revised to Rs 54,103 crore in updated estimates.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY scheme aims to provide durable houses with essential amenities to all eligible urban beneficiaries. Experts consider PMAY a vital initiative for addressing housing shortages in both urban and rural areas. The scheme offers crucial credit-linked subsidies, facilitating homeownership and improved living conditions for eligible families. Piyush Gupta, Managing Director of Capital Markets & Investment Services at Colliers India, noted, ""The Rs 10 lakh crore allocation for rental housing is a significant boost for the real estate sector, supporting the goal of building 3 crore houses across urban and rural areas. This will spur infrastructure development in satellite cities and create numerous job opportunities."" Despite this, the affordable housing segment has struggled since the COVID-19 pandemic, while larger, more expensive homes have sold more rapidly. Data from real estate consultancy Anarock reveals that the share of affordable housing sales in India dropped from over 38 percent in 2019 to 20 percent this year. The supply of affordable homes also fell from nearly 40 percent in 2019 to 18 percent this year due to low demand. Over the past decade, housing finance companies outpaced banks in growth during the first five years (FY13-18), leading to market share gains. Outstanding individual housing loans in India grew at a healthy CAGR of 15 percent over the past decade, reaching Rs 30 lakh crore as of September 2023.

PAT came in at Rs0.7bn (down 94.2% QoQ, PLe: Rs2bn). Reported GRM stood at US$4.7/bbl with an inventory gain of US$0.9/bbl. Average Singapore GRM in Q2FY25-TD is at ~US$4/bbl, and we believe GRMs are likely to remain weak in the long term given adequate refining capacity additions in China, India and the Middle East amid weak demand prospects. Post factoring in OMPL and PP-P contribution, we build in a GRM of US$6.8/7.5/bbl for FY25/26E. The stock is currently trading at 19.7x/16.9x FY25/26 EPS and 10.1x/8.3x FY25/26E EV/EBITDA.

As per the company, disbursals were affected owing to the general elections and seasonality. However, credit flow touched Rs8bn in Jun’24 and CANF expects disbursals of Rs25bn in Q2FY25 and Rs105bn in FY25, which would translate to 15% YoY AuM growth in FY25. We trim loan CAGR over FY24-26E by 1% to 14% due to competition from banks and larger HFCs. If a scheme similar to CLSS is introduced in the upcoming budget, loan growth could be positively impacted by 2-3%. We cut NIM for FY26E by 10bps due to likely repo rate cuts in FY25/FY26 and increased competition given the focus on growth. Outlook We trim PAT for FY26E by 5%.

While core PPoP was in-line, NIM and fees declined QoQ, offset by lower opex. Rise in credit costs led to 2.7% miss on core PAT. Higher loan growth was led by lower yielding segments of housing and corporate. While better liquidity management helped protect NIM, we do not see any further balance sheet headroom to support NIM. Due to RBI embargo on digital onboarding, 2-3 weeks were spent on shifting from digital to physical modes, which impacted unsecured loan growth (+1.8% QoQ vs recent peak of 10%). However, substantial progress has been made in technology improvement, although no timeline has been provided for likely removal of the ban. Outlook As low-ticket unsecured loans are showing signs of overleveraging, we increase provisions by 6-7bps for FY25/26E, which would be offset by lower opex.

Higher NIM was led by the utilization of excess cash and superior loan mix that was a function of QoQ reduction in corporate and increase in retail. Borrowings of e-HDFCL stood at Rs4trn in Mar’24, of which 45% would mature equally between FY25/26/27; e-HDFCL deposits may mature at a faster pace than borrowings. Due to cost differential of 75-100bps between liabilities of e-HDFCL and the bank and improving loan mix, we raise NIM for FY25/26E by 4/5bps. We expect NIM for FY26E to increase by 12bps YoY to 3.67%. Bank suggested that decline in LDR could be faster, and hence, we cut loan growth by 2% each in FY25/26E.

Share prices of Wipro and Infosys, the two Bengaluru-headquartered IT service majors, have jumped over 25 percent in the last year, because of the sentiment that potential recovery in the sector might be around the corner. The Street’s optimism on Artificial intelligence and generative AI bringing demand and innovation for the IT sector despite macro challenges has been a major factor driving this. Any regulatory updates, new initiatives announced during the budget to boost India’s AI mission and skilling will be watched out for as this will directly impact companies like TCS and its customers spending millions of dollars at this point build Gen AI use cases. Moreover, regulatory clarity and incentives would also mean more MNCs setting up their Global Capability Centers (GCCs) in the country – another segment of customers for IT companies as well. Government-level initiatives and investments coming from GCCs were also highlighted in detail in the Economic Survey 2024. Zomato As the consumer tech major plans to increase its focus on the live entertainment sector, apart from expanding its quick commerce and food delivery arms, the company's stock may benefit from any Budget announcements that give a push to consumption such as lowering of income tax rates.

The stock opened at Rs 11,430 on the NSE on July 23. The company stands to benefit further from government incentives aimed at boosting manufacturing and electronics production. As India strives for self-reliance, the upcoming budget is expected to further incentivise local electronics production. Delhivery The logistics unicorn's stock price has not performed well since its listing in May 2022. It has dropped 4 percent in the last one year as the company has struggled with profitability. Any Budget announcements that give a push to sectors like e-commerce, automobiles, MSMEs -- which are its main customer segments -- may boost Delhivery's stock price. Paytm Any enhanced UPI subsidies as well as for digital payments could bring good news to Paytm, which is struggling with lower payment margin since the RBI curbs on its associate company Paytm Payments Bank Limited. Ideaforge Technology Founded by three IIT Bombay graduates (CEO Ankit Mehta, VP Ashish Bhat, VP Rahul singh) other than the company's CFO Vipul Joshi, this Mumbai-based drone company has been one of the early adopters of drone ecosystem in India. The company's results for the FYQ1 2024 indicated significant growth and improvement in several key metrics compared to the same period in the previous year. Technical indicators suggest that the stock has good financial performance alongside good to expensive valuation, but lacks price momentum. As on NSE, ideaForge on July 23, opened at Rs 825.25 per share. With its key customers in the defence sector, traders would be keenly observing at this year's budget for allocation in relevant ministries, any sort of policy announcements and so on. The company has also been spending significant amount of its budget into research and development, and has plans to venture into the US market going forward. EaseMyTrip Travel and tourism has been one of the focus areas of the government and travel aggregators like EaseMyTrip are likely to benefit from the government's measures to boost domestic tourism. Key events this year like the Indian Premier League (IPL) led to a 20-25 percent surge in flight bookings while hotel bookings increased by 15-20 percent on EaseMyTrip. However, shares of the company have been in the red and down 4 percent in the last 12 months on the NSE. It currently trades at Rs 40 a piece on the exchanges. In the March quarter of FY24, the online travel aggregator had slipped into red as it reported a loss of Rs 15 crore as against a profit of Rs 31 crore during the same period a year ago. This is the first time the company incurred a loss in at least three years. Nykaa Nykaa has seen its revenue and profits be largely range bound over the past year or so. In the last 12 months, share prices of FSN e-commerce, the parent company of Nykaa, have gained only around 22.5 percent and still trades below its IPO price. While the increase is decent, it is behind expectations that investors have from new-age tech companies. Any relief in income tax, which leaves more disposable income in the hands of people, will likely be a positive cue for the beauty and personal care brand. The shares were changing hands at Rs 176.1 apiece in early trade on July 23 (around 9:30 am) on the BSE. Nazara Nazara Technologies has seen its stock rise 34 percent in the past year. The stock opened at Rs 877.95 on NSE on July 23. The diversified gaming and sports media firm could benefit from any measure that supports game development, infrastructure or growth of esports in the country. It could also benefit from any measure introduced to bring better tax clarity to real-money gaming industry. Insurtech: PB Fintech, Go Digit Mega changes are expected to take place in insurance sector in the upcoming Budget 2024, including introduction of bill amending the Insurance Act, 1938, aiming for 'Insurance for All by 2047', and the much-awaited composite license for insurers to provide life, health and general insurance policies. Further, Indian insurance companies are eyeing multiple tax exemptions from the central government in the upcoming Budget to enhance attractiveness and affordability of insurance products, thereby promoting greater penetration nationwide. Shares of PB Fintech, which recently received the nod from the IRDAI to upgrade its license from a direct insurance broker to a composite insurance broker, and its newly-listed peer Go Digit may benefit from the announcements. Honasa Consumer Honasa Consumer, which made its public market debut in November last year, has outperformed expectations and already gained around 36 percent in around nine months, with more upside on the horizon. The share currently trades at Rs 458.10 apiece on the NSE. It may further gain if the government announces measures that will leave more disposable income in the hands of people outside the metro cities as a bulk of Honasa’s sales come from non-metro cities. Honasa runs brands like Mamaearth. Further, any policies that will be favourable for sellers on Amazon, Flipkart and other marketplaces will be a positive for the stock as the company is heavily reliant on e-commerce for its sales.

With the government expected to keep the focus on infrastructure spending, allocation towards railways is likely to be enhanced. Factors such as safety, travel quality, infrastructure improvement, faster development and completion of tracks and rolling stock manufacturing are likely to find a mention in the Budget. CareEdge Ratings anticipates a budgetary allocation of around Rs 3 lakh crore for the railways, a 25 percent increase from the previous year. From a stock market perspective, stocks like IRCTC, Container Corporation of India (Concor), Titagarh Rail Systems, Texmaco and Rail Vigas Nigam Ltd (RVNL) are likely to be in focus on the Budget day. IRCTC  IRCTC manages online ticketing, catering, and tourism. Increased budget allocations for railway infrastructure and digitisation initiatives will likely boost IRCTC's revenue from e-ticketing and catering services. Enhanced tourism promotion could also act as a catalyst. The stock has had a lacklustre run on the bourses in the recent past – up less than 3 percent in the past three months. Follow our live blog for the latest on Budget 2024  Container Corporation of India  CONCOR provides multimodal logistics support, primarily container transportation. It operates through terminals across India, offering services including inland container depots, domestic and international freight handling, and logistics solutions. Increased focus on trade facilitation and improved supply chains could lead to higher container traffic, boosting revenues from freight services and logistics. The stock has lost more than 8 percent in the past month. Titagarh Rail Systems  Titagarh Rail specialises in manufacturing freight and passenger railcars, heavy earthmoving and mining equipment, and defence vehicles. It caters primarily to the Indian Railways and defence sector along with international markets.

Texmaco Rail  Texmaco Rail & Engineering manufactures a wide range of railway products including freight cars, wagons, coaches, and bridges. It also offers engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) services for rail infrastructure projects.

Energy stocks in focus ahead of Union Budget today,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/energy-stocks-in-focus-ahead-of-union-budget-today-12775520.html,Stocks,"July 23, 2024 10:24 AM","Ahead of the Union Budget for 2024-25, energy stocks, which are on a dream run on the bourses this year, are in the limelight. Stocks like Adani Power, Coal India, JSW Energy, NTPC, Tata Power, NHPC, SJVN, and Suzlon Energy are shining brightest. Shares of Adani Power, Coal India, JSW Energy, NTPC, and Tata Power have surged over 200 percent in 2024. NHPC and SJVN have gained over 50 percent, while Suzlon Energy is up 20 percent this year and nearly 180 percent over the past year. Analysts are of the view that power stocks have surged, with many penny stocks becoming multi-baggers. Since July 2023, narratives of power shortages, capacity addition, and sector reforms have boosted valuations. The weakest monsoon in 122 years increased demand and power prices from July to October 2023, further driving stock values. In the Interim Budget 2024 on February 1, the Centre allocated at least Rs 28,352 crore to power sector schemes, including renewables, a 50 percent increase from the revised estimate of Rs 18,945 crore in 2023-24. Power sector initiatives saw a 40 percent hike in allocation, from Rs 11,359 crore to Rs 15,861 crore. The power sector anticipates a focus on renewable energy projects and financial support for power distribution companies (discoms) in the full Union Budget on July 23. To reach India's goal of 50 percent non-fossil fuel power capacity by 2030, the country needs to add 50 GW of renewable energy every year for the next five years. The country is now adding about 15 GW a year, according to experts. India's energy needs are expected to grow 2-2.5 times by 2047, driven by the growing economy, but the renewable energy sector still faces challenges, according to the Economic Survey 2023-24 presented on July 22. In 2022-23, fossil fuels dominated India's energy mix, accounting for nearly 84 percent, including coal, oil, and natural gas. However, the electricity sector has shifted significantly towards renewables, with non-fossil power capacity rising from around 32 percent in April 2014 to 45.4 percent in May 2024.

The survey was undertaken by two teams of SOPA which travelled to major soybean growing districts of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan. As per the survey, the area under soybean this year is almost the same as last year, although in some areas there has been some shift from soybean to other crops, mainly maize and pulses. The survey also found a shift to soybean from other kharif crops. The acreage under kharif soybean in Madhya Pradesh, one of the top producers of the crop, was 5.1 mln ha, down 1.5% from the previous year, as per the survey. According to government estimates, the area under soybean cultivation is 5.2 mln ha.

The association took an extensive crop acreage and health monitoring survey of soybean crops in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan between Jul 10 and 16. As far as crop health is concerned, no major threats were found anywhere.

PVR Inox stock slips as brokerages cut target prices after subdued Q1 results,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/pvr-inox-stock-slips-as-brokerages-cut-target-prices-after-subdued-q1-results-12775471.html,Stocks,"July 23, 2024 09:35 AM","PVR Inox shares fell nearly a percent on July 23 as brokerages slashed target prices on the stock after the company reported a weak set of numbers for the fiscal first quarter (Q1FY25). PVR INOX's net loss widened 119 percent on-year to Rs 180 crore and net sales fell 8.75 percent YoY to Rs. 1,190.70 crore due to general elections, and a Cricket-heavy season which resulted in a 13 percent YoY drop in movie releases. Weak ticketing and Food and beverage (F&B) revenue, coupled with operating deleverage, led to a net loss of Rs 140 crore, according to analysts. Absence of tent-pole content impacted admits, occupancy and average ticket price (ATP). The rise in Opex/Screen pulled down core margins further. However, Kalki’s strong performance suggests movie-going remains solely content-driven. A strong line-up of movies across languages means the next two quarters should be sequentially stronger for PVR INOX, according to analysts at JM Financial. Notwithstanding a weak start, management believes FY25 admits could be similar to FY24’s, underscoring its confidence in the content pipeline. Receding impact of Hollywood strike should help normalise release calendar next year, translating into more consistent financial performance. That should help realise revenue synergies of the merger. Management’s calibrated approach on screen addition, gradual pivot to asset-light model and planned divestment of non-core properties should aid free cash flow, said JM Financial. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action PVR Inox’s scale and financial discipline could facilitate further consolidation in the space, driving market share gains, said JMFL as it remained constructive on stock and reiterated the 'buy' rating. However, it trimmed the target price to Rs 2,040 from Rs 2,070 earlier. Stable occupancies, healthy recovery in advertising revenues, increased risk of rising scale, and the traction of movie releases over OTT platforms continue to be the key monitorables according to Motilal Oswal. ""Maintaining occupancy and traction in ad revenues amid an increasing threat from deep-pocketed OTT players remains a key catalyst for growth,"" the brokerage said as it maintained a 'neutral' rating on the stock with a reduced target price of Rs 1,450 per share. With its primary focus on the movie exhibition business, the combined entity (PVR+INOX) will continue to ramp up margin-accretive segments such as F&B revenues and advertisement revenues, which in Nuvama's view will drive the EBITDA expansion for the business. Aggressive expansion and focus on innovation will deliver growth for the business over the longer term, the brokerage noted as it held a 'buy' call on the stock but revised the target price downwards to Rs 1,855 from Rs 1,995 earlier. Also Read | PVR INOX Consolidated June 2024 Net Sales at Rs 1,190.70 crore, down 8.75% YoY At 9:30 am, PVR INOX shares were trading 0.8 percent lower at Rs 1,417.90 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

At 09.23 am, shares of Cyient DLM were trading at Rs 740.40 on the NSE. The company's net profit grew over 98 percent on year to Rs 10.50 crore in Q1 of FY25, up from Rs 5.30 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal. Its revenue from operations rose 18.7 percent to Rs 257.8 crore against Rs 217.1 crore in the year ago period. The growth was driven by a robust performance from the company's defence and aerospace segments, which offset the weakness in the industrial vertical.

JM Financial also maintains a positive outlook on Cyient DLM citing several key factors like the addition of new clients, favorable global market conditions, and an expanded range of value-added services are boosting revenue. Additionally, the brokerage expects margin expansion as the company shifts towards higher-margin segments and customers, with an increasing share of exports. ""Furthermore, the potential for inorganic growth remains strong, as Cyient DLM has yet to utilize its IPO proceeds, which could drive further expansion,"" JM Financial stated.

That is the question. When Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman rises to present her seventh successive budget today, the markets will be waiting with bated breath to see if she can repeat the feat she achieved in 2021 when the Sensex jumped over 2,300 points or five percent – the best-ever post-budget reaction seen in over two decades. Similar to 2021 when the budget was presented in the backdrop of an unprecedented global pandemic – the expectations this year are quite high, with experts pinning their hopes on the newly-formed government continuing its focus on core sectors such as infrastructure, defence and manufacturing, along with a renewed thrust on new-age segments too. From the markets perspective, however, all eyes will be on announcements, if any, related to long term capital gains (LTCG) tax and also Securities Transaction Tax (STT) as these two directly impact the investor community. For more details, follow our Live Blog Experts have been unanimous in saying that any negative surprises related to these taxes would adversely impact the sentiments of the markets that have been volatile with an upward bias in the recent past. Any negative surprise in areas like income tax, LTCG, STCG, or STT could have a short-term negative impact, says Krishna Appala, Senior Research Analyst, Capitalmind Research. This assumes significance as a section of the market has already suggested to the government that STT for high frequency algo traders in the derivatives segment should be hiked. Also Read: Budget 2024: FM urged to hike STT on HFT F&O trades to shield retail investors In the last three months, the Sensex has gained nearly 12 percent or 8,620 points. The broader Nifty has been up 12.37 percent. On Tuesday, however, when the markets open for trading, it would be following two successive days of losses as concerns related to high valuations and positive triggers going ahead are already making a large section of the market nervous. Incidentally, CLSA’s 'India Bull Bear Index' is currently showing 92 percent bullishness – the highest ahead of any Union Budget in the past 15 years – but the global financial major has also expressed a word of caution, stating that such an extreme sentiment reading coupled with stretched valuations make the domestic market setup extremely vulnerable going into the budget. It is interesting to note that while FM Nirmala Sitharaman has presented six budgets till date, the markets have reacted positively on three instances while dipping on the other three occasions. The worst was witnessed in 2020 when the markets fell by over two percent on the day of the budget. Meanwhile, in terms of stock-specific action, the so-called Modi stocks will be in the limelight after the recent subdued performance. The 'Modi stocks' consist mainly of state-owned companies such as PFC, REC, HAL, SAIL, BPCL; banking names like SBI, PNB, Canara Bank, as well as infrastructure companies and those belonging to corporate groups like Reliance Industries, Adani Enterprises, and Adani Ports & SEZ. While the real challenge for the Modi 3.0 government would be to balance three key metrics - economic growth, inflation and fiscal consolidation – the Economic Survey released on Monday had its share of bearish statements as well. “If equity market valuations significantly exceed the real economy's capacity, it signals market instability rather than resilience,” stated the Survey report. To sum up, there have been a total of 29 budgets presented since 2000 and the markets have gained on 13 occasions while losing ground on the other 16. But, more importantly, the Indian stock markets have grown 15x in the last 24 years.

Investors hope for continued government support, with expectations of increased funding for the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) and additional subsidies for housing loan borrowers in Budget 2025. Should these expectations be met, it could provide a significant boost to the housing finance sector and positively impact stocks in this segment. Morgan Stanley analysts highlight that the housing finance industry is looking for increased funding in the PMAY-Gramin scheme, which could drive demand for homes in tier-2 and tier-3 cities. The revamped PMAY-G scheme is anticipated to raise cash support to Rs 2.3-2.4 lakh per housing unit, up from Rs 1.2-1.3 lakh in the previous scheme, to address rising construction costs.

They are seeking an increase in the deduction limit for interest paid on home loans to at least Rs 3 lakh. Additionally, experts are calling for a redefinition of affordable housing. The current definition includes homes with a carpet area up to 90 square meters in non-metropolitan cities and 60 square meters in major cities, valued up to Rs 45 lakh. There is a push to raise this limit to at least Rs 60-65 lakh in non-metro cities and Rs 85 lakh in metropolitan areas to facilitate further construction and extend benefits to more customers. The affordable housing sector has struggled since the Covid-19 pandemic, while the demand for larger and more expensive homes has surged. According to Anarock, the share of affordable housing sales in India dropped from over 38 percent in 2019 to 20 percent this year. The overall supply of affordable homes also decreased from nearly 40 percent in 2019 to 18 percent this year. Over the past decade, housing finance companies have outpaced banks in growth, with outstanding individual housing loans in India growing at a healthy CAGR of 15 percent and reaching Rs 30 lakh crore as of September 2023.

JK Cement stock gains after brokerages raise target prices on positive Q1 results,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jk-cement-stock-may-gain-after-brokerages-raise-target-prices-on-positive-q1-results-12775404.html,Stocks,"July 23, 2024 09:19 AM","Shares of JK Cement gained on July 23 as brokerages raised target prices on the stock after the company reported a 67 percent on-year increase in its consolidated net profit to Rs 184.82 crore for the fiscal first quarter (Q1FY25). The cement maker's revenue from operations edged up 1.62 percent to Rs 2,807.57 crore. Citi has issued a sell call on JK Cement. However, the brokerage raised the target price to Rs 4,400 per share from Rs 3,550 earlier. The company's Q1 EBITDA increased by 19 percent on-year, driven by higher sales volumes and lower costs, which contributed to an outperformance compared to estimates, according to Citi. The company is on track to expand its capacity to 30 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by FY26, up from the current 24 mtpa, with plans to reach 44 mtpa by FY30, the international brokerage said. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action However, industry demand growth is expected to be softer compared to recent years, and with a muted pricing environment, the next phase of capacity expansion is more than a year away, limiting potential upside, said Citi in its note. JK Cement is currently trading at an enterprise value per tonne (EV/t) of $140, compared to other regional cement producers at $70-110/t, Citi added. JK Cement delivered 6 percent YoY volume growth in the April-June quarter with elections and extended heatwaves playing spoilsport. EBITDA was hit by lower-than-anticipated blended realisations, owing to a consistent rollback of prices. However, analysts at Nuvama like the company for its consistent volume growth, capex plans, improvement in efficiency and superior return on equity (RoE).

The brokerage sees a sharp decline in cement prices, demand or a sharp increase in input cost as the key risks.

Insurers hope tax reforms to enhance product affordability in Budget 2024,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/insurers-hope-tax-reforms-to-enhance-product-affordability-in-budget-2024-12775254.html,Stocks,"July 23, 2024 08:07 AM","Insurance stocks, including HDFC Life, General Insurance, ICICI Lombard, LIC, Star Health, and New India Assurance, surged up to 2 percent on July 22, ahead of the Budget presentation. Companies are hopeful for tax rule adjustments to make their products more affordable and are also seeking amendments to the Insurance Act to support the government’s 'Insurance for All by 2047' initiative. Insurance sector's budget wishlist Currently, the Insurance Act of 1938 allows life insurers to offer only life coverage and restricts general insurers to non-life products such as health, motor, fire, and marine insurance. There is anticipation that the government will accept the Parliamentary Committee's recommendations to allow composite licensing, enabling a single entity to offer both life and non-life products. Life insurance companies are also seeking tax deductions on annuities and lower goods and services tax (GST) on their other products. The new tax regime does not permit exemptions on these products, which were allowed under Section 80C in the old tax regime. Additionally, the industry has requested the government to ease minimum capital requirements. Currently, a minimum capital of Rs 100 crore is required for life, general, and health insurance businesses, and Rs 200 crore for reinsurance businesses. Experts suggest that reducing capital requirements could attract more players, especially those focusing on micro-insurance or agriculture insurance. This would provide more affordable insurance options for customers and create more jobs in the sector.

The gross direct premium of public sector insurers increased to Rs 86,324 crore in 2022-23 from Rs 78,335 crore in 2021-22. Additionally, the gross direct premium of health insurers jumped to Rs 26,243 crore in 2022-23 from Rs 20,867 crore a year earlier. Bloomberg data indicates that the insurance sector has been trading at a median price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 28.75 in FY23, up from 22.6x in FY20. This increase has been driven by strong growth in insurance products, healthy premium collections, and wider market penetration.

Nifty’s budget day performance over the past decade: What to expect?,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/niftys-budget-day-performance-over-the-past-decade-what-to-expect-12775277.html,Stocks,"July 23, 2024 07:39 AM","Markets participants are keenly going to watch the presentation of the first Budget of the third consecutive NDA government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi tomorrow by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. Yesterday, Indian benchmark indices ended marginally lower in the volatile session on July 22. Nifty closed at around 24,500 levels trading rangebound throughout the day. While At close, the Sensex was down 79.43 points or 0.10 percent at 80,525.22. An analysis of past data shows that historically, Nifty has moved within a 4 percent range on Budget day. According to Jay Thakkar, Head of Derivative and Quantitative Research at ICICI Securities, “Nifty closes within a range of -2 to +2 percent in 13 out of those 14 budget day sessions, indicating that the 4 percent range is well-defined over the past decade.”Thakkar said that 2021 was an exception when the Nifty closed 4.7 percent (above) its previous close. “Generally, ahead of such events, the options' implied volatilities (IVs) increase, and in the absence of significant changes in the Index, the IVs tend to cool down,” Thakkar added A high IV means traders expect big price swings (either up or down), and low IVs mean traders expect the price to stay relatively stable. Thakkar believes that to benefit from the IV momentum ahead of the event, non-directional strategies should be considered, such as the Short Iron Butterfly or Short Iron Condor. These are four-legged option strategies, involving simultaneously selling and buying of calls and puts. Historical Data Analysis The data below reveals Nifty's performance during the past years Budget sessions and the frequency distribution of the same.   Implied volatility is a measure of how much the price of a stock or other asset is expected to fluctuate in the future. In simpler terms, it reflects the market's expectations of how unpredictable or risky the asset's price is likely to be. Short Iron Butterfly The Short Iron Butterfly strategy involves four options contracts with the same expiration date but three different strike prices. The goal is to profit from minimal movement in the underlying asset's price. This setup includes selling one at-the-money (ATM) call and one ATM put, while simultaneously buying one out-of-the-money (OTM) call and one OTM put. Short Iron Condor The Short Iron Condor strategy also involves four options contracts with the same expiration date but uses four different strike prices. It is similar to the Short Iron Butterfly but with a wider range of strikes, making it a less aggressive strategy. This setup includes selling one lower-strike put and buying one even-lower-strike put, while also selling one higher-strike call and buying one even-higher-strike call.

Key tips for trading on Budget Day that you should know,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/key-tips-for-trading-on-budget-day-that-you-should-know-12774890.html,Stocks,"July 23, 2024 06:30 AM","Market participants are gearing up for the presentation of the full Union Budget 2024 on July 23, keenly observing its potential effects on the Indian economy and market dynamics. STT on F&O is expected to be a key announcement to watch out for tomorrow. Ahead of the Budget, SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch remark and Economic Survey have come down heavily on rising futures and options in the stock market by retail investors. ""The newcomers have not experienced all the cycles of the market and have only seen an upward trend since the COVID-19 fall. The recent election result day volatility was an example of how the markets react in case of a fall,"" said Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst, Capital Market Strategy at Sharekhan. Also Read: Union Budget 2024 Live Updates For tomorrow's budget day trading session, Gedia shares key tips for participants who are positioning for the event: Secondary/Backup Trading AccountTraders should always keep a backup trading account in case there is a glitch with their primary account. If a glitch occurs, traders can take a counter position in the secondary account, thereby limiting potential losses in the primary account. Hedged PositionsEvent days bring volatility. Therefore, traders should always have hedged positions to counter intraday volatility. Psychologically, this helps maintain calmness as you are aware of the maximum potential loss beforehand, avoiding panic situations. Proper Execution and Square-offHedge options strategies are one way to trade on an event day. However, it is crucial to ensure that all legs of the strategy are executed properly and squared off in full. If one leg of the options strategy is left open and the market moves against your view, it can result in a loss. Avoid Counter-Trend Positions Traders should take trades that align with the trend. For example, if markets are in an uptrend, long positions are advised. Taking counter-trend positions without confirmation of a trend reversal should be avoided. Instead, take a hedged position; if you have a long position, hedge it by buying a put option, and vice versa.  Index OptionsTrading index options is advisable due to ample liquidity and the ability to diversify risk arising from announcements related to a particular sector. Keep both bullish and bearish strategies handy and execute them as the market trades in line with your outlook. Stock SelectionUnderstand the impact of announcements related to a particular sector before taking a trade. For example, in the interim budget, the fiscal deficit numbers were better than expected. This information positively impacted PSU banks, hence taking long positions on PSU banks was a sound strategy. Capital PreservationThere will be ample trading and investment opportunities, and the fear of missing out should not induce you to risk your entire capital on a particular trade. A stop-loss is essential to take advantage of the next opportunity that comes your way.

Brokerages hope that FM does not increase STT and LTCG in budget,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/brokerages-hope-that-fm-does-not-increase-stt-and-ltcg-in-budget-12774611.html,Stocks,"July 23, 2024 03:01 AM","As the Union budget approaches, brokerage firms are growing concerned that any increase in the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) or long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax could negatively impact trading volumes, affecting their business operations. Market insiders told Moneycontrol that if STT is increased it will lower the volumes because traders would not trade as frequently as they do now as the overall trading costs would go up. Incidentally, the trading costs are already expected to rise following the uniform exchange fee regime that will come into effect from October 1. STT is a tax charged on the purchase and sale of securities that are listed on the stock exchanges in India. “If STT is increased it will mostly be for the F&O segment and not the cash segment,” said a person wishing not to be named. He further added that an increase in STT would reduce market liquidity, as intraday traders significantly contribute to market liquidity. Shravan Shetty of Primus Partners, however, believes that a 20-30 percent increase in STT will not significantly affect traders, as the tax in absolute terms would still be relatively low. He added that unless the increase is substantial, trading volumes are unlikely to be significantly impacted. He, however, added that if short term capital gain tax is increased with STT, it will have a greater impact on trading volumes. Currently, STT on the sale of options is 0.0625 percent, which is paid by the seller. On the sale of options in which the option is exercised, it is 0.125 percent, which is payable by the buyer. And on sale of futures, it is 0.0125 percent, which is payable by the seller. STT is a major contributor to direct tax collections of the government, and increase in STT rates would likely provide a further boost to such revenues, said Surajkumar Shetty, Partner at JSA Advocates and Solicitors. Currently, the market isn’t anticipating negative surprises in areas like income tax, LTCG, STCG, or STT. However, any changes could have a short-term negative impact, said  Krishna Appala, Sr. Research Analyst, Capitalmind Research. Triggers ahead Demat accounts in India still have relatively low penetration compared to major global markets, presenting significant growth opportunities for brokerage firms, according to Ravi Singh, Senior Vice President of Retail Research at Religare Broking. Financial education is expanding beyond major metropolitan areas, enabling the industry to access previously untapped markets and drive growth, remarked Akshat Garg, Assistant Vice President of Research at Choice Wealth. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has also been proactive with its regulations, the latest being the implementation of a uniform fee for all broking firms. ""The uniform transaction fee could hinder price discovery and trading volumes, potentially being counterproductive,"" commented Nilesh Sharma, Executive Director and President of Samco Securities. On July 1, Sebi issued a directive stating that market infrastructure institutions (MIIs)—including stock exchanges, depositories, and clearing corporations—should charge a uniform fee from their members without offering any volume-based rebates. Exchanges levy a transaction fee on trades conducted on their platforms, charging brokers on a monthly basis. The NSE applies these transaction fees on a slab basis for the month. However, brokers charge their clients daily using the highest slab rate. The difference between the collected fees and the actual fees paid to the NSE is recorded as net profit in the brokers' financial statements. Analysts note that the regulators' increased focus on reducing derivative trading volumes presents another challenge. Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch has frequently pointed out that around 90 percent of traders incur losses in futures and options (F&O). Stocks that could be impacted by potential hikes in Securities Transaction Tax (STT) or Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax include Motilal Oswal Financial Services, 5paisa, ICICI Securities, Angel One, IIFL Securities, and Geojit Financial Services, among others. How is the sector looking?The recent quarters have seen broking firms registering a significant jump in the number of client additions and demat accounts. The total number of demat accounts increased to 16.2 crore in June 2024, as per a report by Motilal Oswal. New additions in June were pegged at 42 lakh -- the highest monthly gain since February 2024. Meanwhile, NSE reported a 3.1 percent month-on-month increase in active clients to 4.42 crore in June 2024.

Banking sector awaits privatisation and capex boost in Budget 2024,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/banking-sector-awaits-privatisation-and-capex-boost-in-budget-2024-12775247.html,Stocks,"July 23, 2024 02:45 AM","Banking stocks, including SBI, Bank of Baroda, IDBI Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and Axis Bank, showed mixed performance on July 22, the day before the Budget presentation. These stocks have been active since the election results on June 4, driven by expectations of public sector bank privatisations and measures to boost private capex. What is the banking industry seeking from this Budget? The 2021 Budget announced the privatisation of some public sector banks (PSBs) as part of a disinvestment initiative aiming to raise Rs 1.75 trillion. This plan included IDBI Bank, two PSBs, and one general insurance company. The disinvestment process for IDBI Bank is still ongoing, and market participants are eager for updates on further equity dilution in PSBs. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities argue that given the buoyant markets and demand for PSU companies in secondary markets, the government should pursue aggressive stake sales, including outright strategic sales or privatizations. Increased allocations towards infrastructure projects such as roads, power, urban development, and railways could also boost credit offtake and improve the overall health of the banking sector, according to analysts. ALSO READ: A look at how markets have moved before and after Budget Since the election results, shares of SBI, Bank of Baroda, IDBI Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and Axis Bank have surged up to 15 percent, compared to a 6.7 percent rise in the Bank Nifty index. Indian banks in excellent health Currently, Indian banks are in excellent condition. Gross bad loans (NPAs) have dropped to a 12-year low of 2.8 percent in FY24, and net NPAs are at a historic low of 0.6 percent. Balance sheets are the strongest they have been in over a decade, and profits have rebounded sharply, quadrupling in 10 years. The return on equity (ROE) of the Indian banking sector is the highest at 15 percent since FY2011. Loan growth in the sector has increased from a decadal average of 10 percent to 15 percent over the past two years. In the past year, shares of Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, SBI, Bank of Baroda, IDBI Bank, and Federal Bank have surged up to 58 percent, compared to a 16 percent rise in the benchmark Nifty 50 index. If the 2024 Budget implements banking reforms, it could increase lending, mobilize deposits, and drive credit offtake, benefiting the banking sector and related stocks. The privatisation of select lenders would also aid fiscal consolidation and attract investors in the equity markets.

AMCs ask for equal treatment of MFs and ULIPs in budget,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/amcs-ask-for-equal-treatment-of-mfs-and-ulips-in-budget-12774735.html,Stocks,"July 23, 2024 02:31 AM","Asset Management Companies are optimistic that the Finance Minister will address the existing tax disparities between equity mutual funds and Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs). Additionally, the mutual fund industry is advocating for equitable treatment between foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and foreign investors investing in Indian Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs). Stocks likely to be impacted by any sector announcements include HDFC AMC, UTI AMC, Nippon Life India Asset Management, and Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC. Christy Mathai, fund manager at Quantum Mutual Fund said that the tax rates for both ULIPs and equity mutual funds should be the same because ULIPs are essentially investment products providing some risk cover.Currently, the returns are not taxed for ULIPs, if the annual premium is less than Rs 2.5 lakh. The government should also revise the definition of equity-oriented mutual fund schemes to include equity Fund of Fund (FoF) schemes, said Mathai. He said that Equity FoFs should be treated on par with equity-oriented mutual funds for taxation purposes. Currently, equity FoFs are classified as debt-oriented for tax purposes. Vinod Joseph of Economic Laws Practice said that there should be tax parity for investments made by foreign investors through the FPI route, and the investments made through Indian Alternate Investment Funds(AIFs). FPIs benefit from Double Tax Avoidance Agreements (DTAs) because they are often based in tax-friendly jurisdictions like Mauritius and Singapore. Joseph said that when an Indian AIF tries to raise money from overseas investors their biggest competitor is an FPI. So, if overseas investors want to invest in Indian equities, they can do it as an FPI or via an AIF. But they go for the former route because of tax benefits due to DTA. He also suggested that the pass-through status should be extended to category 3 AIFs, ensuring that business income is taxed only in the hands of the investors, not the fund. How is the sector looking?Over the past year, asset management companies (AMCs) have enjoyed margin expansion thanks to a more favorable equity mix, spurred by growth in the equity markets. Investors have consistently preferred equity mutual funds over debt and other categories, leading to steady inflows. In June, Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) crossed the Rs 21,000 crore mark, and new fund offers (NFOs) also drew substantial inflows. According to the latest AMFI data for June 2024, active NFO equity inflows jumped 54.1 percent month-on-month to Rs 151.4 billion. However, analysts caution that valuations in the AMC sector seem pricey. AMCs are trading at a 40-50 percent premium to broader markets, according to a report by Kotak Institutional Equities. The report highlighted that while AMCs have strong cash flows and growth potential, their profits can be vulnerable to market downturns. Despite stronger markets supporting AUM growth for all AMCs, this is not always reflected in earnings multiples. Mathai noted that at some point, inflows will slow, and the current valuations might not be justified, leading to a potential de-rating. Jignesh Shial of Incred Capital pointed out that while HDFC AMC appears overvalued, other companies in the sector still show potential for growth.

"Trade Spotlight: How should you trade Mphasis, HUL, Latent View, PI Industries, and others on budget day?",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trade-spotlight-how-should-you-trade-mphasis-hul-latent-view-pi-industries-and-others-on-budget-day-12775276.html,Stocks,"July 23, 2024 12:43 AM","The market recovered nearly 150 points from the day's low and defended 24,500 for another session on July 22, with the Nifty 50 declining just 22 points to 24,509 ahead of the Union Budget on July 23. About 1,345 shares advanced, while 1,038 shares declined on the NSE. Experts see less chance of a major correction, with the Nifty likely to take support in the 24,200-24,000 zone, whereas 24,800-25,000 may act as a resistance area. Here are some trading ideas for the near term: Pravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst at Swastika Investmart PI Industries | CMP: Rs 4,008  PI Industries has given a multi-month breakout above the Rs 4,000 level on the daily chart with strong volume, while on the weekly chart it has broken an upward-sloping channel formation. The structure of the counter is very lucrative, as it is trading above all of its moving averages. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) supports the current strength, and the momentum indicator RSI (Relative Strength Index) is also positively poised. On the higher side, Rs 4,200 acts as a resistance level; above this, we can expect a move towards Rs 4,300+ in the shorter to longer timeframe, while on the lower side, Rs 3,800 serves as important support during any correction. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,300 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,800 Zen Technologies | CMP: Rs 1,436  On the shorter horizon, Zen Technologies is exhibiting traditional bullish momentum and forming higher highs and higher lows. On the longer horizon, it has broken a Flag formation with a large volume. The counter has a lucrative structure as it is trading above all of its significant moving averages. The momentum indicator RSI is positively poised, and the MACD is witnessing a centerline crossover on the upside. On the higher side, Rs 1,500 is acting as an important psychological level; above this, we can expect the level of Rs 1,550+ in the near-short term, while on the lower side, Rs 1,340 will act as major support during any correction. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,564 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,340 Welspun Living | CMP: Rs 178  Welspun Living has seen a breakout of a Cup and Handle formation on the longer timeframe with massive volume, which appears profitable. The structure of the counter looks lucrative, as it is trading above all its important moving averages. On the upper side, Rs 190 is an immediate resistance; above this, we can expect a big move till Rs 195+ in the shorter timeframe, while on the downside, Rs 167 is the demand zone for any correction. The momentum indicator RSI is also positively poised, and the MACD supports the current strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 194 Stop-Loss: Rs 167 Mehul Kothari, DVP – Technical Research at Anand Rathi Latent View Analytics | CMP: Rs 534.5  For many months, Latent View Analytics has been consolidating above the placement of its 200 DEMA (Exponential Moving Average). As a result, we are witnessing multiple bottoms at lower levels, which indicates that the downside is limited. Recently, the stock confirmed a breakout above Rs 567, followed by a pullback. The risk-reward looks lucrative to go long. Thus, we advise traders to buy Latent View Analytics near Rs 530 with a stop-loss of Rs 490 for a target of Rs 610 in the coming months. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 610 Stop-Loss: Rs 490 Chennai Petroleum Corporation | CMP: Rs 1,030  Most petroleum stocks underwent a sharp rally during the first half of July 2024. Then we witnessed some profit booking. As a result, Chennai Petroleum has retraced over 50 percent of the recent rally and now we are witnessing a reversal candlestick pattern on the daily scale. Thus, we advise traders to go long in the stock in the range of Rs 1,030 – 1,010 for a target of Rs 1,250 in the coming months. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,250 Stop-Loss: Rs 900 IndiaMART InterMESH | CMP: Rs 2,856  Similar to Latent View, IndiaMART InterMESH confirmed a fresh range breakout above Rs 2,880 during the last week. Afterward, the stock retraced the previous rally and turned from the short-term moving average. The theoretical target for the range breakout is quite higher, and hence the fall could be a buying opportunity. We advise traders to go long in the stock near Rs 2,850 for a target of Rs 3,250 in the coming months. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,250 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,650 Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Hindustan Unilever | CMP: Rs 2,735.3  HUL has taken off its previous swing high of Rs 2,724 and has seen significant short covering from the lower end, followed by good long built up as well. The momentum indicator MACD is well in the buy mode on the daily as well as weekly chart, indicating that the short-term trend is positive. Since the stock has provided a breakout from the symmetrical triangular pattern, a good directional move is expected on the upside. Generally, July and August are good months for FMCG stocks, so it’s likely to perform positively. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,830, Rs 2,900 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,640 Mphasis | CMP: Rs 2,926  Mphasis has been forming higher tops and higher bottoms on the weekly charts. It has recently taken off its crucial resistance of Rs 2,850, and now above these levels, there is no major hurdle until Rs 3,150, and above that Rs 3,400 looks likely. The stock had also risen in an impulsive wave from Rs 1,660 to Rs 2,838 levels, and now with this breakout, another impulse wave seems to have started on the upside. The stock has also witnessed good long built up in the short term, and the entire sector has seen a good reversal from the lower levels except for Wipro so far, which has delivered poor performance. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,150, Rs 3,400 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,825 Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"Pharma stocks rise in anticipation of hike in Budget expenditure for healthcare, aid to R&amp;D",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/pharma-stocks-rise-in-anticipation-of-hike-in-budget-expenditure-for-healthcare-aid-to-rd-12774717.html,Stocks,"July 22, 2024 11:01 PM","Shares of pharmaceutical companies rose as much as 3 percent on July 22, lifting the Nifty Pharma index around 1 percent higher. This comes in the midst of brewing expectations of the finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman gifting the industry with an increased expenditure on healthcare and measures to boost research and development within the sector in the upcoming Budget. Shares of Alkem Labs, Dr Reddy's Labs, Aurobindo Pharma, Torrent Pharma, Lupin, Cipla and Sun Pharma were traded 1-3 percent higher on the NSE. Given that the government's current healthcare spend sits at around 3 percent of the GDP, lower than global standards, prompting brokerages like Prabhudas Lilladher to anticipate a likely increased allocation for the sector in the upcoming Budget. For context, other economies  the US, UK, France, Germany, Japan, China and South Korea spend 7-17 percent of their total GDP on healthcare. Aside from increased healthcare allocation, the industry also expects the government to announce measures to support R&D within the sector. ""India's pharmaceutical R&D investment currently at 8-10 percent of its revenues, which is lower than the global average of 15-20 percent. Enhanced tax breaks and R&D funding may drive industrial innovation, allowing us to compete worldwide and contribute to the 'Make in India' goals,"" said Dr. Satish Wagh, Chairman & Managing Director, Supriya Lifesciences. Also Read | Budget 2024: Chemical players hope for PLI to boost manufacturing Analysts at Morgan Stanley also believe that for the Indian pharmaceutical market to reach its projected $130 billion by 2030, the government must foster an environment that supports cutting-edge research. This is crucial as drugmakers transition from generics to specialised, high-margin, low-competition drugs. Meanwhile, pharma stocks have garnered the much deserved attention from the Street in recent times, driven largely by improved prospects in the US market, pivot towards more complex products and increased focus in the domestic market. Likewise, the Nifty Pharma index has delivered around 23 percent returns in the year so far.

A major expectation is granting industry status to the real estate sector. This would simplify access to funding and attract foreign investments, thereby enhancing liquidity and project execution. In terms of affordable housing and reviving stalled projects, additional funding through the SWAMIH scheme and new subsidy schemes, such as the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), are anticipated. Revising the definition and upper limit of affordable housing to match current market conditions would also improve affordability. Also Read | Budget 2024: Auto sector foresee key policy measures to drive growth, innovation and sustainability Regarding tax benefits, key revisions expected include adjusting tax slab rates, increasing the standard deduction, raising deduction limits for home loan interest, and reducing the long-term capital gains tax rate to make real estate investments more appealing. Another critical reform expected is the digitization of land records to enhance transparency, minimize disputes, and streamline transactions. Required Reforms An increased allocation for PMAY is essential to boost demand in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. Implementing an “Interest Subvention Scheme” for middle-class housing could encourage homeownership among this segment. Revising income tax rates and raising the limit for eligible home loan interest deductions to at least Rs 3 lakh, along with removing the Rs 2 lakh cap on interest set-off against salary for rented or deemed-to-be-let-out properties, would significantly benefit homeowners. Realty Stocks on Radar The real estate sector has performed exceptionally well in 2024, with strong demand improving cash flows and strengthening the balance sheets of property developers. This has led to increased investor interest in realty shares, driving key stocks to record highs. The Nifty Realty index has surged 38 percent so far this year. Axis Securities anticipates continued emphasis on affordable housing schemes and digital infrastructure improvements, which would benefit major real estate companies. They recommend stocks such as Prestige Estates, Macrotech Developers, and Godrej Properties. Additionally, data center-focused companies like Anant Raj and urban developers like MICL and TARC are expected to perform well. Also Read | Fintechs seek regulatory clarity and certainty, uniform KYC rules from Budget 2024-25 Fisdom also predicts increased funding for affordable housing and the development of satellite townships near metro cities to enhance urban infrastructure.

Additional funds may be allocated to major projects like Jal Jeevan Mission, High-Speed Rail, Smart Cities, and Inland Waterways Development. Tata Projects has called for increased private capital expenditure to boost sector growth, while Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's Interim Budget raised infrastructure capex by 11.1 percent.

The multinational engaged in EPC projects, Hi-tech manufacturing and services is expected to deliver positive results on a year-on-year (YoY) basis, primarily due to sales growth, robust wins in construction, power T&D and Hydrocarbons. According to a Moneycontrol poll, L&T's net profit is expected to jump 15 percent YoY to Rs 2,876 crore from Rs 2,493 crore in the corresponding quarter of FY24. Revenue is seen rising 9.6 percent YoY to Rs 52,518 crore, up from Rs 47,882 crore reported in the year-ago period. The most optimistic estimate sees L&T's net profit rising 28 percent year-on-year. But the most pessimistic projection suggests that net profit might only rise six percent YoY.  On a sequential basis, however, L&T's net profit and revenue are seen falling 33 percent, and 21 percent, respectively. What factors are driving the earnings? Robust Order Book and Execution: L&T's strong order book and efficient project execution are expected to be major contributors to revenue growth, driving higher earnings.

Margins: L&T is expected to report on-year sales growth of 13 percent. With robust order inflow growth, execution completion of legacy projects, refinancing of Hyderabad metro etc, margins may see ramping up but at a slower pace as legacy orders get executed.

According to Avani Bhatt, Vice President of Derivative Research at JM Financial, ""From here on, price moves are expected to be more rationalized and range-bound. India VIX is expected to gradually cool off to the 11-13 percent range in the August series."" Avani adds, ""A lot of factors have changed on the economic, political, and sentiment fronts from the period of the interim budget to the final budget, leading to a high probability of a more accommodative and populist budget. Markets have factored in this scenario and seen a very good recovery of nearly 15% on Nifty from the panic lows of National Election Day."" In context of this view, Bhatt recommends an Iron Fly strategy for the 29th August monthly expiry: Strategy for 29th August expiry: - Sell 24500 CE at Rs 530-540- Sell 24500 PE at Rs 380-390- (Combined premium of 910-930) - Buy 25400 CE at Rs 150-160- Buy 23600 PE at Rs 130-140 Net Premium Inflow: 630-650 Margin Required: Approx Rs 53,000 Target: 500 pointsStop Loss: 250 points  About Short Iron Fly: It is an advanced options strategy that involves selling an at-the-money call and put (forming a straddle) and buying an out-of-the-money call and put (forming wings). This strategy is designed to profit from low volatility and the passage of time, aiming to capture the premium received from selling the straddle while limiting potential losses with the wings. The maximum profit occurs if the underlying asset's price remains near the strike price of the sold options, while losses are capped due to the protective positions of the purchased options.

F&O minimum lot size should be increased to deter casual retail investors: Experts,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/fo-minimum-lot-size-should-be-increased-to-deter-casual-retail-investors-experts-12774492.html,Stocks,"July 22, 2024 02:42 PM","Increasing the minimum lot size for futures and options (F&O) contracts would be an ideal way to cool the unbridled speculation by amateur retail traders in the equity derivatives segment, said market experts during a panel discussion on CNBC-TV18. Earlier this month, Moneycontrol had reported that the Working Committee on Futures and Options has recommended increasing the minimum lot size of derivative contracts to Rs 20 lakh-Rs 30 lakh from Rs 5 lakh presently. Deepak Shenoy of Capital Minds believes that F&O lot sizes have not increased in sync with GDP and market growth. According to Shenoy, ""Having a Rs 20 lakh lot size would be appropriate."" Shenoy also suggested reducing the number of expiries to one per week. At present, there is a weekly contract expiry on every day of the week. Rajesh Baheti from Crosseas Capital proposed a targeted approach to reduce retail participation in F&O trading. ""Steps should be targeted only at the retail segment and not damage the overall market sentiment. Market lot size adjustment would be the best way of addressing retail speculation,"" said Baheti. Last week, SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch said the regulator was compelled to warn against speculative bets in the futures and options (F&O) segment because it has become a ""macro issue"". Speaking at an event organised by SBI Mutual Fund, the regulator said the shift from savings to “speculative” activity was affecting the broader economy now. A good chunk of household financial savings are going into the speculative bets, depriving the real economy of much needed capital. In addition, youngsters were losing tonnes of money on such bets, Buch said. Speaking in the same discussion, Jimit Modi of Samco Securities quoted NSE data showing 4.0-4.5 million individuals participating in the options segment.

Fertiliser stocks surge up to 13% a day before Budget on hopes of rural focus,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/fertiliser-surge-subsidy-union-budget-12774354.html,Stocks,"July 22, 2024 12:02 PM","Fertiliser stocks were buzzing in trade, surging as much as 13 percent, in the run-up to the Union Budget 2024 due to be tabled by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on July 23. The spike in fertiliser stocks came as investors speculate the quantum of subsidy that could be allotted to the sector in the upcoming budget. The interim budget had estimated the fertiliser subsidy requirement for FY25 at Rs 1.64 lakh crore, which is lower than Rs 1.89 lakh crore for FY24. While the Street is not anticipating an increase in the subsidy bill, industry participants are expecting the finance minister may retain the previously estimated subsidy allocation. ""While the budgeted amount is considered to be adequate for FY25 due to moderation in input costs and prices of finished products, the reduced subsidy bill (as compared to FY24) will enable the government to allocate funds to more productive areas,"" Axis Securities wrote in a note. Brokerage expects the government to increase funding towards reducing dependence on fertiliser imports and developing new capabilities such as nano urea. Follow our live blog for all the updates Experts are anticipating greater emphasis on boosting rural consumption, primarily through higher spending on government’s flagship programmes. A rebound in rural consumption should benefit fertiliser companies, as it would likely lead to increased spending by farmers on crop protection. Riding high on these expectations, shares of Deepak Fertilisers, Chambal Fertilisers and Chemicals, National Fertilizers, Gujarat State Fertilizers, Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore (FACT),  and Coromandel International were trading 3-13 percent on the NSE. Fertiliser companies faced disappointing earnings in FY24 due to weak prices, subdued demand, and an influx of low-cost Chinese supplies into the global market. This led to a significant decline in profitability, straining both net profit and revenue of major players. However, signs of recovery have emerged in recent quarters, with expectations of a resurgence in demand in the latter half of the current fiscal, coinciding with the sowing of Rabi crop. In this backdrop, the fertilizer industry is relying on hopes of the government's support to stage a strong rebound later this fiscal.

According to Emkay Global, a meaningful revival in Paytm's lending business seems a far call, given continued partner/regulatory concerns, which coupled with disrupted low MDR UPI payment business would keep revenue growth in check. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action Of the Rs 1,502 crore revenue reported in Q1, the payments business contributed Rs 900 crore, Rs 280 crore came from financial services while the rest was contributed from marketing services. Paytm intends to add more lending partners (including banks), but believes that PL business run-rate would remain at similar levels, unless asset quality concerns ease. The company is running pilots for the secured business, but is unlikely to gain scale in the near term, noted Emkay. ""Thus, we believe that slower disbursements, coupled with declining take rates (3-3.5 percent) as it switches to the distribution-only business model, could disrupt its strategy of monetizing the payment business, and could also hurt EBITDA margin,"" the brokerage said. At 9:36 am, Paytm shares were trading over 2 percent lower at Rs 449 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). While the stock has fallen 40 percent so far this year, it gained around 10 percent in the last one month. According to analysts at Emkay, the recent up-move in Paytm stock price was mainly due to rising hope around swift full-business revival, which still looks distant. ""We believe that the long-pending FIPB approval for investment in its payment subsidiary, expected in near term, which is likely to pave the way for an a/c aggregator license, could be sentimentally positive,"" they said. However, the benefit of this move in terms of new online merchant onboarding is expected to be seen only in the medium-to-long run.

The contract was last traded on the exchange in 2009, according to an official. The exchange withdrew the contract due to liquidity challenges. It hopes the contract will gain traction this time due to increased imports and growing consumption. ""Fifteen years before, India was very different from what it is now,"" another official said. In December, the government exempted yellow peas from import duty till Mar 31 and later till Jun 30. In May the government extended the duty waiver for shipments covered by bill of entry issued on or before Oct 31 after production of tur fell and availability of chana also became a matter of concern. This helped cap the high prices of chana and tur. Yellow peas is an affordable substitute for chana. In 2023-24 (AprMar), India imported around 1.2 mln tn of yellow peas, sharply up from 539 mln tn in the previous year. So far in the current year, India has imported 686,730 tn of yellow peas.

The cement maker's net profit rose marginally to Rs 1,695 crore and revenue grew 2 percent on-year to Rs 18,069, missing street estimates. However, the EBITDA exceeded estimates, driven by higher volumes and RMC sales. UltraTech's guidance on cost reduction and progress in completing capex have given confidence of further upside in the stock. Citi has issued a Buy call on UltraTech Cement, raising the target to Rs 13,000 per share. The optimistic outlook is based on higher volumes, lower costs, and increased sales of ready-mix concrete (RMC). According to analysts at Citi, the key highlights from management commentary during the post-earnings call is the expectation that costs will decrease by over Rs 300 per tonne over the next three years, an improvement over the previously guided Rs 200-300 per tonne figure. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action UltraTech's first quarter was impacted by higher marketing expenditure related to the T20 cricket World Cup. Additionally, July prices were approximately 1.5 percent lower than the first-quarter average, with any potential price hikes likely to occur only after the monsoon season. The company anticipates industry growth of 7-8 percent for FY25, with its own growth expected to be in the double digits. Emkay Global also maintained a 'Buy' rating, adding that India's largest cement manufacturer is on track to achieve 200 mt grey cement capacity by FY27E (~11 percent CAGR) at a capex of less than $75/tonne. This will help the company to achieve industry-leading volume growth, despite its large scale and the lower capex/tonne will boost return ratios, it said.

While the brokerage is upbeat on UltraTech's industry-leading volume growth during the April-June quarter, the rising net debt was a concern, it said.

"Stay stock-specific and maintain strict stop-loss strategies in budget week, pick these 3 stock ideas, advises Jigar",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/stay-stock-specific-and-maintain-strict-stop-loss-strategies-in-budget-week-pick-these-3-stock-ideas-advises-jigar-12774025.html,Stocks,"July 21, 2024 07:55 PM","By Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi It was a historic week (ended July 19) for domestic markets as the benchmark indices reached new milestones, but the bulls lost steam on the last trading session, with a drop of nearly 350 points from the new peak of 24,850, settling in the red. Despite this, the weekly performance was relatively flat, with the Nifty closing with a slight gain of 0.12 percent. Conversely, the BSE Sensex surpassed the 80,000 mark, closing near 80,600, driven mainly by IT stocks, which had been strong performers in recent weeks. Recently we noted that Nifty's breakout above 24,400 suggested a potential rise towards 25,000. However, it only reached 24,850 before profit-booking occurred. Despite this, strong index management continues, previously led by Reliance Industries and now by IT stocks. On the data front, the FIIs' long-short ratio in index futures peaked at 81 percent during the week and is now around 79 percent, which might be a negative indicator for the markets moving forward. In addition, we are witnessing a Bearish Engulfing pattern on the daily scale of Nifty. This indicates that the top of 24,850 would be difficult to conquer. On the other hand, the markets appear resilient, potentially buoyed by expectations for the upcoming 2024 budget. This suggests that there is some indecisiveness at current levels. Traders are advised to stay stock-specific and maintain strict stop-loss strategies. A breach of 24,500 could halt the current momentum and we might witness further profit booking during Monday’s session towards 24,300 – 24,200. The Nifty Bank index was largely sideways to negative, ending with a minor loss of around 0.03 percent. Reversal candlestick patterns are emerging on the weekly scale of Bank Nifty. A close below 51,700 might increase selling pressure, potentially dragging the index down to 51,000 and then 50,000 levels. Conversely, the momentum could resume if the index surpasses 52,800. Here are three buy calls for short term: Bajaj Finserv | CMP: Rs 1,640.25  Since past few days, Bajaj Finserv has been trading in a tight range between Rs 1,565 and Rs 1,610, a phase often seen before a major price shift. It has now broken out of this range with significant trading volume, indicating growing investor interest and confidence. This breakout suggests a potentially good buying opportunity. From a technical standpoint, the daily chart has revealed an Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern with a neckline at Rs 1,620, and the stock is holding steady above this level around Rs 1,640. Moreover, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) has formed a bullish crossover just above the zero line, signalling upward momentum. The combination of the breakout and MACD crossover points to further potential gains. Therefore, considering the technical indicators, initiating long positions in Bajaj Finserv within the Rs 1,620-1,645 range seems prudent. This entry range could lead to a target price of Rs 1,800, offering significant upside potential. To mitigate risk, a stop-loss at Rs 1,550 on a daily closing basis is recommended. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,550 Titan Company | CMP: Rs 3,259  In the past few weeks, Titan has been in a corrective phase after reversing from Bullish BAT pattern on daily chart. Double bottom structure has seen on weekly scale along with massive volume activity at lower levels which is a sign of bullish reversal. Having said that, double bottom structure has seen exactly on previous breakout range which was seen in July 2023. This level, previously a resistance, has now turned into support. Considering these factors, investors might consider buying Titan shares within Rs 3,235-3,265 range, anticipating a potential price increase to a target of Rs 3,575. To manage risk effectively, it is advisable to set a stop-loss order around Rs 3,090 based on daily closing prices, protecting against potential downside movements. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,575 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,090 Aether Industries | CMP: Rs 881.1  Recently, Aether has been in a corrective phase after breaking out from Rs 860 level with significant volume. Notably, the recent correction has occurred with very low volume, suggesting that bearish pressure is weakening near Rs 860-support level. This level, previously a resistance, has now turned into support. Considering these factors, investors might consider buying Aether shares within Rs 860-880 range, anticipating a potential price increase to a target of Rs 970. It is advisable to set a stop-loss order around Rs 820 based on daily closing prices, protecting against potential downside movements.

About 1,984 shares declined against 353 rising shares on the NSE. Experts see a sharp correction if the index decisively closes below 24,500, with 24,000 acting as a crucial support and 24,900 as a hurdle on the higher side. Here are some trading ideas for the near term: Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities ITC | CMP: Rs 474.55  On the weekly time frame, ITC confirmed a ""downsloping trendline"" breakout at the Rs 462 level, indicating a trend reversal.

The daily, weekly, and monthly strength indicator RSI (Relative Strength Index) is in positive terrain, which justifies rising strength across all the time frames. Investors should buy, hold, and accumulate this stock with an expected upside of Rs 500-530, with a downside support zone of Rs 458-445 levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 500, Rs 530 Stop-Loss: Rs 445 Orient Cement | CMP: Rs 325.55 Orient Cement is in a strong uptrend across all time frames, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms indicating a positive bias. It has also confirmed a ""Pennant"" continuation pattern, indicating bullish sentiments. Huge rising volumes at breakout zones signify increased participation. The stock is placed above its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day SMA, and these averages are also inching up along with the price rise, reaffirming the bullish trend.

Investors should buy, hold, and accumulate this stock with an expected upside of Rs 355-375, with a downside support zone of Rs 303-293 levels.

On the weekly time frame, the stock has confirmed a ""rounding bottom formation"" at Rs 1,570 levels on a closing basis, indicating the resumption of the prior uptrend. Huge rising volumes signify increased participation. The daily and weekly strength indicator RSI has turned bullish, showing rising strength. The weekly and monthly ""Bollinger band"" buy signal signifies increased momentum. Investors should buy, hold, and accumulate this stock with an expected upside of Rs 1,730-1,800, with a downside support zone of Rs 1,600-1,565 levels Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,730, Rs 1,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,565 Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst - Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One Avenue Supermarts | CMP: Rs 5,010.7  DMart witnessed a substantial increase in price in the last couple of trading sessions from the 21 DEMA (Exponential Moving Average) on the daily chart. Additionally, the counter witnessed an ‘ascending triangle’ breakout, construing a positive development. From a technical standpoint, the counter has gained significant traction in terms of volumes lately, which is likely to augur well from a short to medium-term outlook. On the oscillator front, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) signals a continuation move, suggesting a potential upside journey in a comparable period. Hence, we recommend buying DMart around Rs 5,000-4,960. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 5,350, Rs 5,400 Stop-Loss: Rs 4,790 Hindustan Unilever | CMP: Rs 2,727  Hindustan Unilever witnessed a decisive multi-week breakout in the last trading week, soaring nearly 4 percent. The counter has witnessed very strong traction in the last couple of trading weeks and seems poised to continue its northward move in the comparable period. Additionally, the recent gains have been backed by a notable increase in trading volumes, adding a bullish quotient to its undertone.

Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,950, Rs 3,000 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,550 Life Insurance Corporation of India | CMP: Rs 1,108.25  LIC witnessed a substantial increase in price in the last couple of trading sessions to breach its previous swing high on the daily chart. Additionally, the counter witnessed strong traction in terms of trading volumes and has also witnessed a range breakout on the weekly time frame chart.

Additionally, the management mentioned the possibility of exploring a stake sale outside the HDB Financial IPO process during their earnings conference call on July 20. ""The board has given a nod to start the HDB Financial IPO in today's meeting, with the mandatory requirement for the IPO to be completed by September 2025. Outside of the HDB Financial IPO process, we are open to exploring a stake sale.

""If you look at some of the key metrics, whether it is net interest margins (NIMs), CASA ratios, cost to income, or GNPA, from that starting point to 30 June 2024, it has been stable and range-bound. The GNPA has been in the range of 1.2 percent to 1.4 percent, and if you exclude the seasonality of agriculture, it has been on a declining trend,"" HDFC Bank said. The management emphasised that excluding NPAs in the agricultural segment, the gross NPA would be 1.16 percent compared to 1.33 percent in Q1FY25.

In the June-ended quarter, Kotak Mahindra Bank reported a 20 basis points (bps) sequential drop in its unsecured loan book growth to 11.6 percent from 11.8 percent. On the other hand, NIM remained flat quarter-on-quarter at 5.02 percent in Q1FY24, but was down 55 bps year-on-year from 5.57 percent in Q1FY23.

The central bank took this action after examining the country's fourth-largest private lender's IT systems in 2022 and 2023 and finding concerns that Kotak failed to adequately address information technology-related drawbacks. When asked about the progress made in improving its IT systems, Kotak Bank said they are committed to completing the process efficiently. ""It is hard to predict when the RBI will approve the complete overhaul of our technology systems. But, we remain committed to finishing everything and are working on this with great determination. We will continue to perfect our tech systems with incredible gusto and mitigate this impact as soon as possible,"" the management stated.

During this week, Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) extended their buying, as they bought equities worth Rs 10,945.98 crore. However, Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) turned net sellers as they sold equities worth Rs 4,226.29 crore. ""The progress in the earnings season and the rebalancing of investor portfolios ahead of the union budget have influenced the market this week. Additionally, a global IT outage has caused disruptions in various Indian industries due to issues with computers running on Microsoft. This has impacted the airline services and uncertainty across major economies, banks, and financial services, capping off a turbulent week in the markets,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services. ""Though the expectation for Q1FY24 earnings has subdued, the above-expected results from the IT majors provide scope for an upgrade in earnings for FY25. This has attracted more FII inflow to the IT and other defensive large-cap sector Pharma and FMCG spaces. Further, the market direction will be determined by upcoming budget outcomes. Investors are anticipating pro-industry and populist measures with prudence on fiscal. If the budget meets the expectation, it will provide more stability in the market,"" he added.

Where is Nifty50 headed? Amol Athawale, VP-Technical Research, Kotak Securities The current market texture is non-directional and volatile hence level based trading would be the ideal strategy for the traders. 24,500/80,400 and 24,350/80,000 would act as a key support zone for the bulls while 24,850-25,000 / 81,600-82,000 could be the key resistance areas for the traders. However, below 24,350/80000 the sentiment could change. Below the same, positional traders may prefer to exit the trading long positions. For Bank Nifty now 25-day SMA (Simple Moving Average) and 51750 are immediate support zones while 52800 and 53200 would be the immediate resistance areas for the positional traders. Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst - Technical & Derivatives, Angel One As we approach the upcoming Budget week, it is important to note that the volatility index may experience an uptick. This is due to India VIX teetering on the edge of a consolidation breakout on the daily time frame leading up to the Budget week. As far as levels are concerned, a sustainable plunge below 24,500 is likely to provide some more respite to the benchmark for a potential downside to 24,300-24,200 (20 DEMA) on an intermediate basis, while the sacrosanct support lies at 24,000 mark.

Commodity investors to focus on FOMC statement next week as markets nearly certain of first rate cut in September,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/commodities/commodity-investors-to-focus-on-fomc-statement-next-week-as-markets-nearly-certain-of-first-rate-cut-in-september-12780107.html,Commodities,"July 27, 2024 07:00 PM","By Kaynat Chainwala, AVP - Commodity Research at Kotak Securities Tamer US inflation figures provided markets a much needed relief at the end of the turbulent week (ended July 26) marked by political uncertainty, sell-off in global tech shares and serious concerns about Chinese economic recovery. Following a sharp pullback from all-time highs in the previous week, Gold prices briefly recovered and surged above $2400 per troy ounce earlier this week as President Joe Biden's decision to end his re-election campaign and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris prompted speculation on whether it would benefit or hinder Donald Trump's chances of returning to the White House. However, the uptick did not last long as recovery in dollar coupled with markets’ preference of Yen as a safe-haven asset over gold led to sharp retreat in gold to two-week low of $2351.9 per troy ounce. COMEX gold rebounded to $2,389.7 per ounce but closed with a second consecutive weekly loss, while Silver tumbled more than 4 percent this week, in line with weakness in gold and base metals. On the domestic front, decline in gold and silver was steeper at 6.9 percent and 8.9 percent respectively primarily due to the cut in import duty from 15 percent to 6 percent, which exceeded the market's expectations of a 10 percent reduction. Lower prices could potentially stimulate retail demand and prompt increased imports in the medium term. WTI crude prices closed the week lower by 4.4 percent, marking a third consecutive weekly decline as weak Chinese demand prospects and hopes of Gaza ceasefire outweighed the impact of lower US stock levels. Chinese slowdown concerns further hurt the demand outlook amid already declining refinery runs and imports. OPEC+ ministerial meeting due August 1 is likely to attract attention from oil market participants, although no changes to the group's output policy are expected. On the four hourly chart, MCX Crude Oil (August) has witnessed support near its 50 percent ‘Fibonacci Retracement Level’. In addition, MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator has provided a fresh positive crossover affirming positive momentum. Next resistance for the counter is placed at Rs 6,730 per barrel, above which major resistance is placed at Rs 6,880. Losses in base metals deepened this week as recent interest rate cuts by the People’s Bank of China, intended to bolster a struggling economy, failed to boost confidence in the demand outlook, thereby pushing LME Copper, Aluminium to four-month lows and Zinc to lowest levels since April. The upcoming Politburo meeting, scheduled for late July, will be closely watched by investors to see if the government acknowledges economic headwinds and implements more immediate measures to proactively boost domestic demand. Core PCE increased 0.2 percent MoM from May and 2.6 percent from a year ago, slightly exceeding expectations, thereby pushing July rate cut off the table. However, impact of the same was muted on dollar and most commodities as moderating inflation and a cooler labour market kept markets nearly certain of the first rate cut in September. Investors will now turn their attention to the upcoming FOMC statement and key economic data next week for additional guidance on future monetary policy. Bank of Japan policy decision will also be closely watched amid tightening expectations, contrasting with anticipated rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank.

"Gold prices drop by Rs 5,000/10gm post Budget; bring cheers to retail investors",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gold-prices-drop-by-rs-500010gm-post-budget-bring-cheers-to-retail-investors-12779268.html,Commodities,"July 26, 2024 01:10 PM","Gold prices have corrected sharply by 7 per cent or Rs 5,000 per 10 grams in the local markets after the government slashed basic custom duty on gold, and the lower costs will encourage more people to invest in the yellow metal, both as a commodity and as a financial asset, experts say. Analysts said customs duty cut has made gold imports cheaper. The move will help curb the rampant issue of gold smuggling, leading to growth in the organised jewellery sector. ""The cut in basic custom duty on gold prices makes the yellow metal cheaper. While this can lead to weaker market sentiments due to the sudden change, retail investors stand to benefit from the new, more attractive pricing for gold,"" Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst of Commodity and Currency at LKP Securities told PTI. Echoing similar sentiments, Krishnan R-Director & CEO of Unimoni Financial Services said lower costs will encourage more people to invest in gold, both as a commodity and as a financial asset, which is often seen as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Following the Budget announcement by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman that the government has slashed basic customs duties on gold and silver from 15 per cent to 6 per cent, gold prices crashed by Rs 3,350 to Rs 72,300 per 10 grams in the national capital on Tuesday. The precious metal prices continued the downtrend and plunged by Rs 650 on Wednesday. The yellow metal rates saw another steep fall on Thursday, nosediving by Rs 1,000 to settle at Rs 70,650 per 10 grams, as per the All India Sarafa Association. After the duty cut, the yellow metal has declined Rs 5,000 per 10 grams or 7.1 per cent in the past three sessions, since July 23 when it had fallen Rs 3,350 to end at Rs 72,300 per kg. Also, gold of 99.5 per cent purity declined by Rs 1,000 to Rs 70,300 per 10 grams on Thursday. It had also lost ground by Rs 5,000 per 10 grams in the three previous sessions. On Thursday, silver rates also lost ground by Rs 3,500 per kg to Rs 84,000 per kg. In the past three sessions, the rates of the bright metal fell sharply by Rs 7,000 or 8.3 per cent to Rs 84,000 per kg from Rs 91,000 per kg. Traders also said that a sharp correction in gold prices have revived the demand for jewellery among consumers as they flocked to jewellery outlets to take advantage of lower prices. ""The reduction in basic custom duties have spurted the demand for jewellery in the domestic markets. Further, this will act as a sales booster for jewellers before the festive seasons, encouraging fresh buying by the consumers due to lower prices,"" PC Jeweller Managing Director Balram Garg told PTI. Low gold prices will help domestic jewellers, particularly the organised ones, Garg said. According to MP Ahammed, Chairman, Malabar Group, the reduction has been a long-standing demand of traders in the gold sector, as it is expected to curb the rampant issue of gold smuggling, which poses a substantial threat to the Indian economy. ""With the new rates, the duty on one kilogram of gold drops from Rs 9.82 lakh to Rs 3.93 lakh, making smuggling less attractive and more manageable. ""This move will help dismantle the mafia chain involved in smuggling, leading to growth in the organised jewellery sector and increasing government revenue through GST and income tax,"" Ahammed said. Meanwhile, in futures trade on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), gold futures have partially recovered after three days of slump on Friday. The most traded August contract jumped Rs 288 to Rs 67,750 per 10 grams on the MCX. It had settled at Rs 67,462 per 10 grams in the previous session on Thursday. However, silver contracts for September delivery continued its downward trend by declining Rs 241 to Rs 81,090 per kg. It had closed at Rs 81,331 per kg in the previous session on Thursday. As per the market experts, there will be stability in bullion prices once there is clarity on several economic and political factors such as interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve. ""Stability in gold prices is expected once there is clarity on several economic and political factors including, potential interest rate cuts in the US and India, and the outcome of the US Presidential elections will provide a clear direction for gold prices,"" Jateen Trivedi said.

""With near-term support at $2,280, we believe gold can hit $2,680 by the end of this year when we start seeing rate cuts,"" she said, adding that the U.S. presidential election and US-China trade tensions were key triggers that could lead to a significant rebound in prices.

Data on Thursday showed that the U.S. economy grew faster than expected in the second quarter, but inflation pressures subsided, leaving intact expectations of a September rate cut. Non-yielding bullion's appeal tends to shine in a low-interest-rate environment.

But concerns about soft economic conditions in Asia's biggest economies, China and Japan, capped gains. Brent crude futures for September rose 7 cents to $82.44 a barrel by 0014 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for September increased 4 cents to $78.32 per barrel. In the second quarter, the U.S. economy grew at a faster-than-expected annualised rate of 2.8% as consumers spent more and businesses increased investments, Commerce Department data showed. Economists polled by Reuters had predicted U.S. gross domestic product would grow by 2.0% over the period. At the same time, inflation pressures eased, which kept intact expectations that the Federal Reserve would move forward with a September interest rate cut. Lower interest rates tend to boost economic activity, which can spur oil demand. Still, continued signs of trouble in parts of Asia limited oil price gains. Core consumer prices in Japan's capital were up 2.2% in July from a year earlier, data showed on Friday, raising market expectations of an interest rate hike in the near term. But an index that strips away energy costs, seen as a better gauge of underlying price trends, rose at the slowest annual pace in nearly two years, suggesting that price hikes are moderating due to soft consumption. China, the world's biggest crude importer, surprised markets for a second time this week by conducting an unscheduled lending operation on Thursday at steeply lower rates, suggesting authorities are trying to provide heavier monetary stimulus to prop up the economy.

Brent crude futures for September fell 38 cents, or 0.5%, to $81.33 a barrel by 0129 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for September slid 33 cents, or 0.4%, to $77.26 per barrel. Benchmarks settled higher on Wednesday, snapping three straight sessions of declines after the Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude inventories fell by 3.7 million barrels last week. That compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1.6-million-barrel draw. [EIA/S] U.S. gasoline stocks dropped by 5.6 million barrels, compared with analysts' expectations for a 400,000 draw. Distillate stockpiles fell by 2.8 million barrels versus expectations for a 250,000-barrel increase, the EIA data showed. ""Despite draws in U.S. crude and gasoline stocks, investors remained wary about weakening demand in China and expectations of advancing ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas added to pressure,"" said Hiroyuki Kikukawa, president of NS Trading, a unit of Nissan Securities. This year, China's oil imports and refinery runs have trended lower than in 2023 on lower fuel demand amid sluggish economic growth, according to government data. Slumping U.S. stock markets also reduced traders' risk appetite, Kikukawa added. All three main indexes on Wall Street ended lower on Wednesday. In the Middle East, efforts to reach a ceasefire deal to end the war in the Gaza Strip between Israel and militant group Hamas under a plan outlined by U.S. President Joe Biden in May and mediated by Egypt and Qatar have gained momentum over the past month. On Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sketched a vague outline of a plan for a ""deradicalized"" post-war Gaza in a speech to U.S. Congress and touted a potential future alliance between Israel and America's Arab allies.

The survey was undertaken by two teams of SOPA which travelled to major soybean growing districts of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan. As per the survey, the area under soybean this year is almost the same as last year, although in some areas there has been some shift from soybean to other crops, mainly maize and pulses. The survey also found a shift to soybean from other kharif crops. The acreage under kharif soybean in Madhya Pradesh, one of the top producers of the crop, was 5.1 mln ha, down 1.5% from the previous year, as per the survey. According to government estimates, the area under soybean cultivation is 5.2 mln ha.

The government sowing figures are still not updated and may be revised upwards, the association said. In Rajasthan, the area under soybean was 1.0 mln ha, down 7.2% on year, while as per the government data, the acreage for kharif soybean was also largely the same at 1.0 mln ha as the association data. The association took an extensive crop acreage and health monitoring survey of soybean crops in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan between Jul 10 and 16.

Brent crude futures for September fell 9 cents to $82.31 a barrel by 0005 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for September declined 10 cents to $78.30 per barrel. Traders mostly ignored U.S. President Joe Biden's decision to call off his reelection bid and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday. Citi analysts said they believed neither Harris nor Republican nominee Donald Trump would promote policies that would greatly affect oil and gas operations. Instead, the market focused on oil supply and demand, which Morgan Stanley analysts said was likely to balance out by the fourth quarter and rise to a surplus by next year, which would drag down Brent prices to the mid-to-high $70s per barrel range. The American Petroleum Institute, a trade group, is due to release its estimates for last week's oil inventories on Tuesday, while official U.S. government data is scheduled to land on Wednesday.

[EIA/S] [API/S] On the demand side, the prospects of cuts in interest rates in coming months in the United States and Europe helped to support the market. Lower interest rates often spark buying and boost oil demand. Federal Reserve officials said on Wednesday the U.S. central bank is ""closer"" to cutting interest rates given inflation's improved trajectory and a labor market in better balance, possibly setting the stage for a reduction in borrowing costs in September. Also, U.S. economic activity expanded at a slight to modest pace from late May through early July with firms expecting slower growth ahead. The European Central Bank, meanwhile, is all but certain to keep interest rates unchanged on Thursday, but signaled that its next move is likely to be a cut. Investors are also awaiting policy news from a key leadership gathering in China that is to end on Thursday. The dollar eased on Thursday for a third straight session. A weaker dollar can boost demand for oil by making greenback-denominated commodities like oil cheaper for holders of other currencies.

""Particularly, if we start seeing some more favourable U.S. CPI prints, which could make the Fed more dovish on rates than is already priced in.""

Fed Chair Powell, in his testimony, acknowledged the cooling labour market and progress in controlling inflation, emphasizing that the central bank does not require inflation to drop below 2 percent before considering rate cuts. Meanwhile, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly expects further easing in price pressures and the labour market, supporting the case for rate cuts. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee believes the US economy is on track to achieve 2 percent inflation. US headline inflation slowed more than expected to a one-year low of 3 percent in June, while the annual core measure dropped to a three-year low of 3.3 percent, prompting US equities to reach new record highs and pushing the US dollar to a five-week low of 104.04. COMEX Gold prices jumped to $2422 per troy ounce, as signs of softness in the labour market and ongoing disinflationary trends improved the conviction that the Fed might pivot to rate cuts soon, sending 2-year and 10-year treasury yields to the lowest since March. On the four hourly charts, MCX Gold (Aug) has given an upward breakout of its ‘Double Bottom’ chart pattern affirming bullish control. In addition, on the daily chart, the price has closed above its previous swing high of Rs 73,149 per 10 grams. Next resistance for the counter is placed at Rs 73,780 above which major resistance is placed at Rs 74,400. Silver gained momentum with Gold, surpassing the $32 per troy ounce mark but closed the week 1 percent lower near $31 per troy ounce owing to weakness in base metals. LME base metals faced pressure due to subdued market expectations regarding a policy shift from the Third Plenum coupled with lacklustre domestic demand highlighted in China's trade data. WTI Crude oil dipped below $81 per barrel earlier in the week as concerns about supply from Hurricane Beryl eased. However, oil prices rebounded sharply to $83.74 per barrel and nearly erased the weekly decline, supported by indications of improved fuel demand in the US during the summer travel season and expectations of an imminent Fed policy pivot. Furthermore, the EIA increased its 2024 demand estimate to 1.11 million barrels per day (bpd) from 1.08 million bpd, and OPEC maintained its strong oil demand growth forecast of 2.2 million bpd for 2024. In contrast, the IEA lowered its 2025 oil demand growth forecast to 980,000 bpd from 1 million bpd, citing weak consumption in China. Next week, US retail sales figures for June, expected to decline 0.3 percent month-over-month according to Bloomberg forecasts, are anticipated to reflect another month of weak spending due to slowing average hourly earnings growth and consumer caution. Additionally, the ECB policy meeting will be closely watched for hints on the timing of the next rate cut, although it is likely that policymakers will leave rates unchanged this month. Metals may continue to face pressure as key economic indicators from China are expected to underscore slowing activity. Most importantly, traders will closely watch China's once-in-five-years key political gathering (July 15 – 18) to see if the country addresses the persistent property crisis and cautious consumer spending, even though the event primarily focuses on longer-term political and economic reforms.

Gold eases but set for weekly gain as Fed rate-cut bets boost appeal,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gold-eases-but-set-for-weekly-gain-as-fed-rate-cut-bets-boost-appeal-12767335.html,Commodities,"July 12, 2024 08:00 AM","Gold prices eased on Friday but headed for a third straight weekly rise, after cooler-than-expected U.S. inflation data sparked hopes that the Federal Reserve will likely start cutting interest rates in September. Spot gold fell 0.2% at $2,408.70 per ounce, as of 0148 GMT after rising 2% on Thursday. U.S. gold futures eased 0.3% at $2,413.90. Data on Thursday showed that U.S. consumer prices unexpectedly fell and the annual increase was the smallest in a year, drawing the Fed another step closer to cutting interest rates. ""Inflation outlook and interest rate picture have moved in favour of gold this week. As we move closer to a lower interest rate environment, conditions could be ripe for gold to set new record highs before the year is out,"" said Tim Waterer, KCM Trade's chief market analyst. According to CME FedWatch Tool, bets of a September U.S. cut were now at 93%, compared to a 70% chance before the data was released. Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion. San Francisco Fed Bank President Mary Daly on Thursday said that she expects further easing in both price pressures and the labor market to warrant interest rate cuts, while Chicago Fed Bank President Austan Goolsbee said the U.S. economy looks like it is back on track to 2% inflation. Investors now await the U.S. producer price index (PPI) reading due at 1230 GMT. ""The PPI figures could be key in determining which side of the $2,400 level gold ends the week at,"" Waterer said. Spot silver slipped 0.8% to $31.20 per ounce, after scaling a more than one-month high on Thursday. Platinum fell 0.2% at $1,001.90 and palladium dropped 1% to $984.63.

Brent crude futures rose 37 cents, or 0.4%, to $85.77 a barrel by 0031 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 50 cents, or 0.6%, to $83.12 a barrel. Both contracts gained in the prior two sessions, but Brent futures were set to decline about 1% week-over-week after four consecutive weeks of gains. WTI futures were virtually unchanged on a weekly basis. U.S. gasoline demand was at 9.4 million barrels per day (bpd) in the week ended July 5, the highest for the week that includes the Independence Day holiday since 2019, government data showed on Wednesday. Jet fuel demand on a four-week average basis was at its strongest since January 2020, according to the data. Strong fuel demand encouraged U.S. refiners to ramp up activity and draw from crude oil stockpiles, supporting prices. U.S. Gulf Coast refiners' net input of crude rose last week to more than 9.4 million bpd for the first time since January 2019, government data showed. WTI front-month futures recorded their steepest premium to the next-month contract since April, a signal of near-term supply tightness. U.S. government data on Thursday showed an unexpected decline in consumer prices in June, stoking hopes that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates soon. The prospect of easing monetary policy has helped boost sentiment across the commodities sector, ANZ analyst Daniel Hynes wrote in a note. A weaker U.S. dollar has also increased investor appetite, he added. The U.S. dollar index slipped lower for a third consecutive session on Friday, as market participants raised their bets for a September U.S. interest rate cut.
